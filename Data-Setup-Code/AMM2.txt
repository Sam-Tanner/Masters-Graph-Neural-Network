AB Background: Separation anxiety (SA) can be defined as the fear reaction and protest manifested by children when the main caregivers move away from him/her or in front of unfamiliar person. SA near eight months may be considered as an important and normal phase of the correct and typical social neurodevelopment. Aims of the present pilot study is assessing the prevalence of separation anxiety in a population of patients with migraine without aura (MwA).
   Materials and methods: 119 children (69 males) suffering from MwA (mean age 1.78 +/- 7: 59) were consecutively recruited. The control population consisted of 231 (114 males) healthy subjects similar for age (7.64 +/- 1: 34; p = 0.768) and gender (p = 0.987)
   The Screen for child anxiety related emotional disorders (SCARED) test was used to assess the prevalence of separation anxiety among MwA children.
   Results: Healthy individuals are on average less affected (mean 4.72 +/- 0: 32) of the Separation Anxiety Disorder respect of MwA children (mean 6.83 +/- 0.97; p < 0.001) (Figure 1).
   Conclusion. MwA presents many psychiatric comorbidities and among ones separation anxiety may be considered in the clinical and therapeutic management of pediatric primary headache.

AB Introduction: Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is an opportunistic pathogen leading to nosocomial epidemics and multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates are making the treatment of these infections more complicated. Combinations of antibiotics acting by different mechanisms are used for the treatment of MDR bacterial infections. In this study we evaluated the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of colistin (CO), doripenem (DOR), tigecycline (TIG) alone and in vitro synergistic activity of CODOR, CO-TIG and DOR-TIG combinations against MDR A. baumannii strains isolated from patients in intensive care units (ICUs).
   Materials and methods: Thirty A. baumannii strains isolated from various clinical specimens of patients in ICUs were included in the study. The epsilometer test (E-test) method was used for determining the synergistic activity of different antibiotic combinations. Synergistic, additive, indifferent and antagonist effects of A. baumannii strains were evaluated by Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (FIC) index.
   Results: Of the 30 MDR A. baumannii strains tested, 90% were susceptible to TIG, 93.3% to CO and 50% to DOR. CO-DOR, CO-TIG and DOR-TIG combinations were found to have synergistic or additive effects against 3 (9.9%), 5 (16.6%) and 4 strains (13.3%), respectively. The synergistic or additive effect of DOR-TIG combination was 19.9% for DOR resistant strains and 6.6% for DOR susceptible strains. The synergistic or additive effect of CO-DOR combination was 19.9% for DOR resistant strains and 0% for DOR susceptible strains.
   Conclusion: Among the tested antimicrobial combinations, the combination of CO with TIG was most effective against MDR A. baumannii strains isolated from patients in ICUs. The synergistic or additive effects both for CO-DOR and DOR-TIG combinations were higher in DOR resistant strains. This study suggested that combination therapy with DOR for treating MDR A. baumannii infections should be used especially in DOR resistant strains.

AB Introduction: An attempt was made to examine the protective effects of omega-3 fatty acids against liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in rats.
   Materials and methods: Twenty-one male Wistar rats were divided in three groups. Group I was chosen as control, Group II subcutaneously injected every other day with CCl4 for 1 month, whereas rats in Group III were received daily.-3 fatty acids via intragastric gavage while exposed to CCl4 for 1 month. Finally, all animals were killed by decapitation and blood samples were taken. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total and conjugated bilirubin levels were measured. Additionally, hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were determined. For histopathological evaluation, the liver samples from experimental and control groups were processed for light microscopy.
   Results: All serum biochemical parameters and the hepatic MDA content were significantly higher in animals treated with CCl4 than in the controls, while SOD and GSH-Px values were significantly decreased in these animals. Moreover, administration of CCl4 alone caused histopathologically prominent damage in the liver compared to the control group. Daily.-3 fatty acids treatment significantly reduced serum biochemical parameters and hepatic MDA levels. These fatty acids also reduced serum SOD and GSH-Px activities in rats received CCl4 plus.-3 fatty acids. Furthermore, the histopathological changes induced by CCl4 were attenuated with administration of.-3 fatty acids.
   Conclusion: These findings suggested that.-3 fatty acids are involved in protecting liver against CCl4 toxicity.

AB Introduction: We address the topic of feet position during the quiet upright stance balance test over a force platform. Such position is widely discussed and three among the most accepted criteria were submitted to comparison.
   Materials and methods: 55 subjects devoid of any evident motor dysfunction were receiving the test in the three selected feet positions configurations: Joined Parallel [JP], 30 degrees degrees with 5 cm heels apart [30 degrees], Parallel Apart [PA] at about 15 cm distance from each other. Six sequences have been selected and applied in a random way to the subjects in order to avoid learning effects or fatigue bias in the test results.
   Results: The data have demonstrated that: 1) The Romberg quotients (the ratio between homologous parameters calculated in the Closed Eyes Test vs. the Open Eyes Test), although affected by the feet position, keep their standard meaning independently by the feet position; 2) A significantly greater variability of Sway Parameters is afforded by the Joined Parallel Feet [JP] while the Parallel Apart Feet position [PA] seems to afford the lowest sensitivity in quantifying balance performances; 3) The [30 degrees] test seems to be the most comfortable one and therefore likely to be the most convenient for unstable or dysfunctional subjects that cannot keep the [JP] position; 4) The [PA] and the [30 degrees] test are showing very similar results.
   Conclusion: We can therefore conclude that the first choice for feet positioning to perform balance tests on force platform should be towards the Joined Parallel Feet, the others, however, might represent a valid choice for impaired patients.

AB Introduction: We investigated the effectiveness of multidisciplinary, 8 weeks, outpatient Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in old elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). And also we aimed to compare the outcomes of multidisciplinary, 8 weeks, outpatient PR programme in young elderly and old elderly patients with COPD.
   Methods: Patients underwent multidisciplinary PR in a hospital outpatient programme twice weekly for 8 weeks. Dyspnea, incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) distance, endurance time (ET) health status with SGRQ, anxiety and depression scores and body compositions were assessed before and after PR.
   Results: Subjects were divided in two groups: group A (young elderly) (n = 33, mean age 62.39 +/- 5.66 years) and group B (old elderly) (n = 16, mean age 77.34 +/- 2.52 years). ISWT distance increased significantly (P < 0.001) by a median 40 m in group A and 65 m in group B. There were significant improvements in HAD (Hospital Anxiety Depression) scores within the young and old elderly groups.
   Conclusions: With PR; except for the improvement in exercise capacity, old elderly patients with COPD improved dyspnea, health related quality of life, anxiety and depression as much as the young elderly ones. PR should be integrated to the treatment of symptomatic patients who is 75 years and older with decreased exercise capacity, daily activities and quality of life as an effective approach. Age should not be an exclusion criteria for comprehensive outpatient PR programmes. Out patient PR is an effective treatment strategy for old elderly patients with COPD.

AB Aneurysmal Bone Cyst (ABC) are extremely rare in the head and neck region and even rare in sinuses. It's a benign multicystic mass that is locally-destructive and rapidly expandable. The etiopathogenesis, even today, is not entirely clear. However, hemorragic fluid content and septated appearance are the characteristic feature of ABC. The clinical presentation produces symptoms due to the compression of adjacent structures or as a result of a pathological fracture and depends on localization. Most common location in this area are the mandible and maxillary bones. The complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice. There are limited reports in literature on these tumors at the sinonasal level. We present a complete review of the literature as well as an unusual localization of ABC in this district.

AB Introduction: Oxidative stress is a biological condition characterized by the breakdown of the physiological cellular balance between production and elimination of chemical elements for oxidizing activity. Many causes may cause an increase in the production of free radicals of oxygen and the present study aims to assess the extent of oxidative stress, in patients undergoing surgical interventions in the ent district
   Materials and methods: The study was performed on 50 patients, of both sexes, aged between 20 and 60 years, divided into two groups, A and B The subjects in both groups had undergone surgery of various types within the ENT. Group A consisted of 25 patients who, in the post-operative period for a total temporal space of 3 months, were treated with a compound with immunostimulatory activity, Pidotimod, while the B group, the control group, was composed of 25 patients who, in the post-operative period, were not treated with Pidotimod or other substances having immunostimulatory and/or bioprotective. Each patient, either in group A and group B, was submitted to blood sampling for dosage of plasma levels and lymphocyte of specific markers of cellular oxidative stress,
   Results: The analysis of the results has allowed us to notice Group A patients treated with Pidotimod, the presence of a whole set of variations lymphocyte and plasma between the two different phases, pre-and post-treatment
   Conclusions: It is possible to state that patients undergoing surgery for otolaryngologic pathologies may be in systemic "oxidative stress" conditions.

AB Introduction: There are numerous relationships between behaviour and immune system. Is particularly useful to identify the possible role played by a specific molecule to immunostimulant, Pidotimod, on restoring and optimizing physical performance in pediatric patients undergoing adeno-tonsillectomy surgery.
   Materials and methods: The study was performed on 600 patients, 275 males and 325 females, aged between 5 and 12 years, all subjected to adeno-tonsillectomy surgery.
   Group A: 300 patients treated with immunostimulant therapy (Pidotimod).
   Group B: 300 untreated patients with no therapy.
   The treatment of patients in the A group with Pidotimod provided for the administration of the drug, which started soon after hospitalization Parents of all patients provided a specific questionnaire
   The patient follow-up was divided into three phases:
   Phase T0: one week after the adeno-tonsillectomy intervention
   Phase T1: three months after the adeno-tonsillectomy intervention
   Phase T2: six months after the adeno-tonsillectomy operation.
   Results: The analysis of the obtained data revealed in its "absolute" evaluation the presence of a difference, somewhat evident, expressed in mean values, between the total score obtained in group A and that in group B.
   PHASE T0: The analysis of "relative" values, related to each single symptom, identified as the most prevalent phenomena, in descending order of frequency, dysphagia, odinophagia and asthenia
   PHASE T1: Reduction in the mean value of the mean score for the reference symptoms
   PHASE T2: Further decrease in the mean score for the reference symptoms in the two different groups
   Conclusions: The results of the study carried out, highlight the role that immunostimulants, specifically Pidotimod, can be used to optimize healing processes in pediatric patients undergoing adeno-tonsillectomy surgery.

AB Introduction: The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) is a standard used for the implementation and evaluation of antibiotic susceptibility tests in many European countries. The EUCAST standard has been used in Turkey since 2015. The aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in antibiotic susceptibilities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) isolates using local data during the transition process from the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standards to EUCAST.
   Materials and methods: In total, 105 non-duplicate clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were analyzed. Conventional methods and the Vitek-2 automated system (bioMerieux, France) were used to identify the isolates. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed with the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. In addition to the routinely used discs, ceftazidime 10 mu g and piperacillin/tazobactam 30/6 g were added to create different contents for both of the standards. The antibiotic susceptibility zone diameters of the isolates were evaluated in accordance with the CLSI 2014 and EUCAST 2014 standards, and a difference in the ratio of resistance levels was found.
   Results: It was observed that antibiotics with different disc contents had different resistance ratios according to the evaluation made with each of the standards. The resistance ratio of ceftazidime (10 mu g to 30 mu g) and piperacillin/tazobactam (100/10 mu g to 30/6 mu g) in P. aeruginosa increased from 1.9% and 0.95% to 4.8% and 15.2%, respectively, when we compared the CLSI 2014 with the EUCAST 2014 standards. There were no significant differences in the susceptibility results for imipenem, meropenem, amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and cefepime.
   Conclusion: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is one of the most important tasks in clinical microbiology laboratories. Upon the implementation of the EUCAST guidelines, laboratories should be aware of the implications of modified drug susceptibility testing reports on antibiotic prescription policies. Additionally, the continuity of local surveillance activities should be ensured.

AB Introduction: To assess the effect of vitamin D and calcium supplement on HbA1c and blood pressure in patients with Type 2 diabetes.
   Methods: This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 48 patients with type 2 diabetes visiting the Diabetes Clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital in Zabol in Southeast of Iran from March to August 2016. They were divided into three groups, one of which received vitamin D supplement and routine treatments (A). The second group received vitamin D and calcium supplement and routine treatments (B). The third group received placebos and routine treatments (C). For a month, they were orally treated with 50000 units of vitamin D supplement and 150-250 milligrams of calcium on a daily basis. The HbA1c level and blood pressure were recorded before and after the intervention.
   Results: Blood pressure decreased after the intervention in the first and second groups; however, no significant decrease was observed in the third group (p=0.001) The HbA1c levels decreased by 1.76 and 1.85 in the first and second groups, respectively. An intragroup comparison, drawn after the intervention, indicated that HbA1c decreased in patients (28.08 -/+ 2 to 20.50 -/+ 2, p=0.122).
   Conclusion: Vitamin D and calcium supplements can decrease blood pressure and HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes.

AB In this research, a new method is presented for internal dosimetry of liver tissue in radiotherapy by neutron. First, the Haunsfield Unit of every existing tissue in the body, and then the constituent compounds of them are defined and inputted into MATLAB and MCNPX code respectively. Then, the abdominal tissue is wholly homogeneous filled up with the related material which is having self-radiodensity, and afterwards the liver tissue is contoured and segmented among the abdominal tissue, and the exact geometry of the segmented liver tissue is generated as inputting data, and this data is transferred into the MCNPX code. After that, the absorbed dose is obtained in the liver tissue. This method can be performed for every patient by his/ her own CT scan images to determine the desired absorbed dose.

AB Objective: Spontaneous heterotopic pregnancy is rare but it is a dangerous condition in pregnant women. This paper discusses its incidence, diagnosis and management.
   Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 13 spontaneous heterotopic pregnancies diagnosed at the Women's Hospital of Zhejiang University. The chief complaints, diagnostic characteristics, intraoperative findings, treatment of each patient were reviewed.
   Results: 13 cases were identified between January 2000 and December 2014, involving tubal, ovarian, intramural, and cesarean scar heterotopic pregnancies conceived spontaneously. The common chief complaints and symptoms were abdominal pain (7 of 13), vaginal bleeding (7 of 13), and adnexal mass or thickening (9 of 13). Transvaginal ultrasound was an important aid in diagnosis. Surgery was performed in 10 patients, and the medical or expectant managements were also successful.
   Conclusion: Heterotopic pregnancies are rare but it has an increasing incidence. Transvaginal ultrasound is usually useful, and timely treatment can improve the prognosis.

TI A RARE CAUSE OF RHABDOMYOLYSIS AND ACUTE RENAL FAILURE IN AN ADULT
   PATIENT: CARNITINE PALMITOYLTRANSFERASE II DEFICIENCY
SO ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA
LA English
DT Article
DE Carnitine palmitoyl transferase II deficiency; rhabdomyolysis; acute
   renal failure
ID FEATURES
AB Introduction: Inherited metabolic disorders are the most common causes of recurrent rhabdomyolysis in adults and children. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) deficiency is the most common inherited lipid metabolism disorder resulting in recurrent myoglobinuria. CPT II deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive trait and clinical phenotype varies from severe and multisystemic infantile form to mild muscle form characterized by rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria. Exercise, infections, starvation, and cold exposure are the most important factors triggering rhabdomyolysis in cases with CPT II deficiency. The severity of disease episodes is considerably variable and some patients may develop acute renal failure during the episodes.
   Case presentation: The current manuscript presents a patient with acute uremia, who suffered from nausea, vomiting, and dark-colored urination in the past three days. The patient was initially considered to have acute renal failure (ARF) associated with dehydration. However, high levels of creatine phosphokinase suggested the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. Remarkable medical history for prolonged starvation and cold exposure and past medical history that was remarkable for a single episode of dark-colored urination in adolescence prompted genetic analysis, which revealed carnitine palmitoyltransferase II(CPT II) deficiency. The current report presents a patient with acute renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis that was associated with CPT II deficiency and it highlights the importance of anamnesis in diagnosis and treatment.
   Conclusion: Inherited disorders are one of the rare but important causes of rhabdomyolysis. These inherited causes are often overlooked. The present manuscript has attempted to highlight these issues.

DE Type 2 diabetes mellitus; 6-Item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale
ID PERSISTENCE; MANAGEMENT
AB Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between metabolic control and Morisky scale in the population of diabetic patients and the factors that contribute to low motivation and knowledge.
   Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients that presented to Eskisehir Government Hospital, Eskisehir Yunus Emre Government Hospital, and Sakarya Private Hospital for routine follow-up between June-October-2015. 6-item Morisky scale was applied to each subject. The Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to compare the groups that were not distributed normally, when the number of groups was three or more. The Pearson's Chi-Square, Yate's Chi-Square and Pearson's Exact Chi-Square tests were used for the analyses of cross tables.
   Results: The main finding of the study is that the values of HbA1c, triglyceride, HDL and LDL were significantly better and the rate of achieving target HbA1c and HDL values was significantly higher in the group of patients with high motivation and knowledge according to the Morisky scale. Backward stepwise analysis indicated that level of education was a factor that affects motivation, and that illiteracy was associated with low motivation (Odd's ratio: 3.02 CI: 1.51-6.04, p=0.002). Exercise habit and level of education were the factors that have an impact on high/low knowledge. The risk of low knowledge was higher in participants with no exercise habits (Odd's ratio: 2.91, CI: 1.34-6.33, p=0.007). The risk of low knowledge was also higher in illiterate participants (Odd's ratio: 3.25, CI: 1.30-8.86, p=0.021).
   Conclusion: More attention should be paid to illiterate female patients, in order to ensure their adherence to treatment. To this end, there is a need to cooperate with educational institutions, and to offer easily accessible reading and writing instruction and training on diabetes and to encourage such patients to get trained.

AB Introduction: Since thyroid gland disorders are present in a considerable percentage of the world population and thyroidectomy represents the most commonly performed endocrine surgical procedure world-vide, medical teams involved in surgical treatment of these patients can face a series of complications, out of which some might be life-threatening.
   Materials and methods: The paper analyzes the most difficult complications that can arise during and after thyroidectomy, presents risk factors for their development and contemporary literature concepts regarding this topic.
   Results: Understanding the mechanisms which lead to their occurrence and methods of their prevention, along with adequate and timely application of therapeuthic measures represent basic strategies that should be employed in order to reduce the rate of these complications.
   Conclusion: Adequate preoperative preparation of patients, experienced surgical team and the meticulous technique, early recognition and urgent treatment of complications by the anaesthesiologist, along with multidisciplinary approach, are the basic preconditions for successful treatment in thyroid surgery.

AB Purpose: Smoking is an important risk factor of many diseases and is serious threaten for human health. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of 8-week aerobic exercise program on Cholesterol, Blood Lipids and cigarette withdrawal behavior of Smokers.
   Methods: A quasi experimental with pre and posttest design were conducted in this study. 24 male smokers with mean age of 22.3 +/- 3.2 participated in this study. Blood-lipids, cholesterol profile and withdrawal behavior of subjects was tested before and after intervention.
   Results: The results suggested that exercise intervention not only improved the cigarette withdrawal behavior in depressed smokers, but also decreased LDL, TG and cholesterol (p <= 0.05) while HDL was not influenced by exercise intervention (p= 0.05).
   Conclusion: Conclusively, it was revealed that smokers can benefit from aerobic exercise. The exercise may increase the oxygen supply to the brain, and cause a better mood and mitigate the negative consequences of smoking and probably it can be the main reason for improving withdrawal symptoms of smoking. The positive effects of exercise on cholesterol and other lipids may be justified, by regulating the metabolism of all lipids in the blood. It must be noted that further research needed to understand the mechanisms involved in improved lipid profiles and withdrawal symptoms, such as stress reduction or neurobiological mechanisms.

TI MRI DIAGNOSIS OF OCCULT FRACTURE PATTERN OF ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT

DT Article
DE Taekwondo Athlete; Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury; Knee Joint;
   Fracture Pattern; MRI Diagnosis
AB This paper explored the fracture pattern of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in Taekwondo athletes, for the purpose of improving the clinical diagnostic value of MRI. To analyze the effect of MRI diagnosis in detecting the occult fracture pattern of ACL injured knee joint, we randomly selected 1300 Taekwondo athletes with ACL injured knee fracture from a hospital, and conducted retrospective analysis of their clinical data and analyzed the distribution characteristics of their lesions. According to the results, it can be concluded that the probability for occult knee joint fracture with ACL injury was 92% (1200/1300), the probability for occult knee lateral compartment fracture with ACL injury was 85% (1100/1300). Regarding the fracture type such as lateral femoral condyle fracture, tibia lateral frontal fracture, and lateral tibial plateau posterior fracture, the probabilities for them with ACL injuries were 80% (800/1000), 67% (600/900), and 89% (400/450), respectively. In addition, lateral tibial plateau posterior fracture, lateral femoral condyle fracture, and occult fracture of the anterior intercondylar area were all observed in combination with ACL injury. Analysis of the data showed that knee joint occult fracture was the indirect embodiment of ACL injury, with a strong association between the two. However, lateral tibial plateau posterior fracture, lateral femoral condyle "kissing contusion" and occult fracture of the anterior intercondylar area were not as associated with ACL injury.

AB Background: regular exercise and garlic complement can independently improve lipid profiles. However, combining these lifestyle modifications may be more effective than either intervention alone. Therefore, We examined the effects of 8 weeks High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) with and without garlic supplement on some lipid profiles in obese inactive women.
   Method: The study used a 3-experimental group, pretest and posttest design with 40 obese women of mean age 35.9 +/- 1.7 years (BMI, more than 30) whom were purposefully selected and randomly divided into three experimental groups and control group. The first experimental group followed a 8-week training program on 3 days/week; the second one underwent on the same training program with garlic supplement intake simultaneously; the third group has just garlic supplement and a control group with no training and supplement. before taking primary and final blood samples, the 24-hour diet recall questionnaire was used to control the subject's diet the day before taking blood samples. Total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides were assessed by the enzymatic colorimetric method on an Architect C8000 system using the respective reagent kits. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald formula.
   Results: Improved lipid profiles were detected in the HIIT exercise and garlic complement in obese inactive women (p=0.05). The results indicated that garlic supplementation and exercise training improved all lipid profiles including TG, HDL, LDL, Chol/HDL and VLDL, while the combination of HIIT and garlic supplement may have more significant effect on lipid profiles (p=0.05).
   Conclusion: HIIT exercise and garlic complement improves the lipid profiles such including LDL, HDL, Cholesterol and Triglyceride in obese inactive women. It appears that HIIT exercise and garlic supplement may represent an effective approach for improving lipid profiles in obese inactive women individuals

AB Introduction: To compare conventional intraperitoneal vancomycin-amikacin and intravenous tigecycline treatments for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) related peritonitis.
   Materials and methods: Patients diagnosed with CAPD-related peritonitis were randomized into two groups as intravenous tigecycline group (n = 10) and intraperitoneal vancomycin-amikacin group (n = 20). Patients accompanied by peritonitis exit site infection, peritonitis based on Pseudomonas or fungi were excluded from the study.
   Results: As for 24th and 48th hours peritoneal fluid leukocyte count of patients, significant difference was not observed in tigecycline group at 24th hours, while significant reduction was observed in vancomycin-amikacin group (p < 0.05). A significant reduction was observed at 48th hours in both groups. As for the treatment response, abdominal pain decreased in 18 (90%) patients in vancomycin-amikacin group, decreased in 8 (80%) patients in tigecycline group at 48th hours. It was detected that dialysate leukocyte count decreased significantly (p > 0.05). Relapse was observed in 4 (40%) patients in tigecycline group, while not observed in vancomycin-amikacin group (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Tigecycline proved its effectiveness in the clinical use for complicated intra-abdominal infections. However, it was considered that tigecycline cannot be alternative to vancomycin-amikacin treatment for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis related peritonitis.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of complete blood count parameters in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.
   Materials and methods: 58 patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis and 60 patients underwent surgery elective cholecystectomy have been included retrospectively this to case-control study. Groups compared according to age, gender, white blood cell count, mean platelet volume, platelet count, red blood cell distribution width, neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio and platelet / lymphocyte ratio.
   Results: Any significative difference hasn't been detected between the two groups in terms of age (p = 0.144; p> 0.05). In the control group, more male patients have been observed than acute cholecystitis group (p <0.05). Red blood cell distribution width, neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio, platelet / lymphocyte ratio values and leukocyte levels of the patients in the study group have been observed significantly higher than the control group (p <0.05). The parameter with the highest sensitivity and specificity was found as NLR.
   Conclusion: The highest sensitivity and specificity parameter is neutrofil-leukocyte ratio. We suggest that neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio aids in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis since neutrofil-leukocyte ratio is cheap, ease of use and rapid assessment method.

AB Introduction: 'Renqing Mangjue' pill (RMP) is a classical and empirical clinical prescription of Traditional Tibetan Medicine (TTM), but the absence of the mechanism of action restricts its clinical application. We aimed to explore the toxicological effects of RMP.
   Materials and methods: The dose-dependent perturbations in urinary metabolite concentrations caused by RMP toxicity were investigated using 1H NMR spectroscopy coupled with multivariate statistical analysis. Wistar rats were investigated by exposing to RMP at different dosages. Urine samples were collected during toxic insult and regenerative phase and analyzed by NMR, ICP-MS and multivariate data analysis. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of 1H NMR from rat urine revealed a dose-dependent metabolic shift between the vehicle-treated control rats and rats treated with RMP.
   Results: Compared with control group, the administration of high dosed RMP led to elevation of urinary carnitine, cysteine, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, tyrosine, alpha-hydroxy-n-valerate and 4-aminohippurate accompanied by level decreases in urinary creatinine, glucose, histidine, lactate and urocanate in 1 day post-dose. After 15 days following the administration of high dosed RMP, the higher concentration of creatinine, cysteine, glucose, asparagine, allantoin, isoleucine and glutamate and the lower concentrations of histidine, tyrosine, tryptophan and urocanate were observed.
   Conclusion: The toxicity involves the perturbation of energy metabolism, amino acids metabolism and purine metabolism in high dosed group, while changes in another two dosed groups were less significant. An immediate As-related toxicity was also observed in high dosed group. Hg and Pb may be responsible for the inhibition of the recovery since they could not excrete easily from urine. This work illustrated the high reliability of NMR-based metabonomic approach on the study of the biochemical effects induced by traditional Tibetan medicine.

AB Introduction: Among the patients with the diagnosis of cancer, lifetime risk of development of other malignancies is higher than that of the people without cancer diagnosis. In literature, the reports about the patients with multiple primary malignancies are being published with increasing frequency.
   Case presentation: A 58 year-old female patient was diagnosed as left breast cancer, staged as pT1N0M0, in June 2002. In July 2010 basal cell skin cancer (pT1N0M0) on the skin of epigastric region, in January 2013 right breast cancer (pT1bN0M0), in February 2014 lung squamous cell carcinoma in upper lobe of left lung (pT2N0M0) and bladder invasive urothelial carcinoma (pT2bN0M0) developed in that patient. It was proven pathologically that all of these tumors are primary tumors, not metastasis from another one.
   Conclusion: There is no consensus in the treatment of patients with multiple primary malignancies. Our patient was treated for each tumor according to its own stage with multimodality approach. She is now 72 year-old, currently in complete clinical and radiological remission and she continues follow-up visits.

AB Introduction: Carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) strains are challenging topics for hospitals. We determined the antibiotic susceptibilities and genetic resistance mechanisms of 135 A. baumannii isolates from Giresun State Hospital, Turkey between January 2013 and September 2014.
   Material and methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standarts Institute guidelines. beta-lactamase coding genes were investigated by simplex/multiplex PCR.
   Results: High rates of multi drug resistance (51.11%) and extensively drug-resistance (48.14%) were remarkable. Colistin was seemed to be the only active compound against all clinical strains. Isolates were found 100% positive for bla(OXA-51) and 95.55% positive for bla(OXA-23). Of all the isolates, 97.05% were found to be blaTEM (n=131) positive concomitant with whether bla(OXA-51) or bla(OXA23) or both them. All strains were negative for the rest of the beta-lactamase coding genes. ISAb1 element was positive in the 98.51% (n=133) of the isolates and 100% of them were located upstream of bla(OXA-51/23).
   Conclusion: To our knowledge this study revealed the highest co-existence of bla(OXA-51/23) and also demonstrated the increase of co-existence of both bla(OXA-51/23) and ISAba1/bla(OXA-51/23) over time in Turkey. The increasing combination of these genes and element may lead more resistance against to carbapenems among A. baumannii isolates.

AB Background: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) has been successfully utilized for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases, including diabetes mellitus, osteomyelitis and radiation induced necrotic lesions. These diseases are characterized by significant vascular damage and prolonged wound healing process. HBO has been recently shown to mobilize stem/progenitor cells from the bone marrow. Because of its potential to promote neovascularization it is believed that HBO contributes to vascular damage recovery. In this study we questioned whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy might exert pro-angiogenic effects via the modulation of endothelial progenitor cells.
   Methods: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 15 healthy human volunteers (5 women and 10 men; mean age: 49.4 +/- 2.56 years; body weight: 70.3 +/- 4.58 kg; height: 1.67 +/- 4.19 m) before and after exposure to hyperbaric oxygen (n= 8) for 20 days (90 min at 2.4 ATA once a day) and exposure to hyperbaric compressed air (n= 7), for 90 minutes at 2.4 ATA twice per day for 20 days. Flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis was performed on these samples to identify and enumerate endothelial progenitor cells.
   Results: Our results show a significant effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on surface markers of endothelial progenitor cells in healthy volunteers. The number of CD34/CD133-expressing cells increased in volunteers after both the 1st (p < 0.02) and the 10th HBO exposures (p < 0.05). HBO group shows also significant increase of CD34/CD133/VEGFR-2 -expressing cells only at 1st treatment (p < 0.05), compared to basal values, returning to normal values at wash out.
   Conclusion: HBO might induce modulation of endothelial progenitor cells biology and this mechanism could initiate clinical benefits exerted by neoangiogenesis and neovascularization.

AB Introduction: Platelets have many functions notably atherogenesis, inflamation and atherothrombosis. Platelets precursors megakaryocytes are shown to contribute to bone formation with osteoblasts. It was indicated that vitamin D, which also played an important role in bone remodeling, had receptors in many tissues as well as receptors in platelets, and these receptors decreased in osteoporosis. In this study we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the mean platelet volume (MPV), which shows platelets and platelet functions, and bone mineral density (BMD) and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in postmenopausal women.
   Material and methods: Three hundred sixty two postmenopausal women were included in this study. Their demographics, laboratory values and BMD were recorded. The subjects were divided into three groups as control, osteopenia and osteoporosis according to the results of BMD. MPV and platelet counts were investigated in these groups. Also correlation tests were performed to evaluate the relationship between platelet functions, vitamin D and BMD measurements.
   Results: There was no difference in MPV and platelet counts between groups. No significant correlation was determined between MPV and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. However, based on the findings of our study, we established that there was a significant correlation between the platelet count and lumbar spine (L1-4) T score.
   Conclusion: This study showed that there was no relationship between MPV and osteoporosis. MPV might be considered a less important indicator in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and osteoporosis.

AB Objective: Injury caused by tornado kick turn 720 degrees to horse step landing in Wushu jump is studied with detailed analysis of the biomechanical principles of the injuries.
   Methods: The author selected 3450 cases of athlete injured in Wushu routine movements between January 2014 and January 2016. Documentary analysis, logical analysis and expert interviews were used to analyze the biomechanical principles of the knee joint injury in athletes. Then based on the results, future rehabilitation measures are proposed.
   Results: Wushu athletes' landing in tornado kick turn 720 degrees to horse step can cause serious damage to the knee, as huge impact will be created by the moment during landing. At the same time, the weight of Wushu athletes as well as height of the arch will exert huge impact on athletes' knee joint.
   Conclusion: During tornado kick turn 720 degrees to horse step landing, Wushu athletes should pay more attention to the serious force generated by the movement and try to slow down landing time in order to reduce the impact. This will effectively protect the athletes' knee joint and keep the athletes healthy, which is important in the Wushu athletes' career.

ID COMPLICATIONS; ASSOCIATION
AB Introduction: previous studies have shown that to normalize blood glucose is able to delay the occurrence of complications. This study aimed to investigate the role of self-management in the blood glucose control of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and explore the relationship of self-management with risk factors of chronic complications of T2DM.
   Materials and methods: a survey was conducted in 900 DM patients in the Huamu Community Health Center in Shanghai in Deptember 2014, and the individual background, past medical history, self-management of DM were collected. Moreover, these patients received physical examination and laboratory examination.
   Results: excise and medication in self-management were negatively related to glycated hemoglobin (P<0.05), special diet and excise in self-management were negatively associated with systolic blood pressure (P<0.05), and general diet and excise in selfmanagement were negatively related to urinary microalbumin to creatinine ratio (P<0.05). The self-management has no relationship with total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterin. Logistic regression analysis showed good excise (OR 0.929, 95% CI 0.877-0.983) and medication (OR 0.932, 95% CI 0.886-0.981) in self-management were helpful for the normalization of blood glucose, and good excise was able to reduce the risk for microalbuminuria (OR 0.918, 95% CI 0.861-0.979).
   Conclusion: the effective self-management of DM desires to be generalized in clinical practice. To improve the self-management in T2DM patients is helpful to control blood glucose and blood pressure and delay the microalbuminuria progression.

AB Objective: To investigate the effects of magnetic alprostadil lipid microsphere in targeted treatment of ischemia-reperfusion injury in abdominal flaps of rats.
   Methods: An animal model of ischemia-reperfusion injury in abdominal flaps of rats was developed. The study group was injected with magnetic alprostadil lipid microsphere via the opposite femoral artery, while the control group injected with physiological saline, and the blank group was treated with no vessel blockage or medication after skin flap preparation. At different time points of ischemia and reperfusion of the skin flaps, the blood flow volume and the content of MDA and NO in the flap tissues were determined by a laser Doppler Flowmetry, thiobarbituric acid method, and nitrate reductase method, respectively. At 7h after suture in situ of the skin flaps, the designed area and survived area of the skin flaps were determined by coordinate decal method, based on which, the survival rate of the skin flaps was calculated. Meanwhile, routine histopathologic slides of the flap tissues were taken for immunohistochemical staining to identify the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
   Results: The study group had significantly higher micro-circulation volume, NO synthesis quantity, VEGF expression density, and 7-d survival rate and significantly lower MDS level of the skin flaps than the control group and blank group.
   Conclusion: As a high-performance bioactive compound, alprostadil can improve the micro-circulation and lighten the ischemia-reperfusion injury by increasing NO content and protecting the vascular endothelium of skin flaps.

AB This paper aimed to explore and analyze the clinical therapeutic effect of L-carnitine combined with hemodialysis for the treatment of uremic peripheral neuropathy. 5000 cases of uremic peripheral neuropathy patients admitted to our hospital were selected, and were divided into experimental and control groups based on their different treatment programs. 2500 cases of uremic peripheral neuropathy patients in the control group were treated with conventional hemodialysis therapy, while 2,500 patients in the experimental group were treated with L-carnitine combined with hemodialysis. The purpose of the controlled trial was to compare the clinical outcomes of the two groups. Statistical analysis of the differences in clinical treatment outcome between the two groups was performed with Chi-square and t tests.
   Results: showed that there were varying degrees of improvement in various clinical indicators after the treatment. Clinical symptom improvement, improvement in nerve conduction velocity, and the overall treatment effectiveness in the experimental group patients treated with L-carnitine combined with hemodialysis were significantly superior to those of the control group patients treated simply with hemodialysis. Differences between the groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Based on the experimental findings, it can be concluded that treatment of uremic peripheral neuropathy patients with L-carnitine combined with hemodialysis yielded significant and reliable clinical effects. It can effectively speed up nerve conduction velocity with clinical significance, and is thus worthy of increased use in clinical practice.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that play important roles in regulating cancers. We previously indicated that miR-222 promotes non-small cell lung cancer growth. Here, we aimed to investigate whether the miR-222 expression level was associated with clinic pathological factors and prognostic values of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The expression level of miR-222 in the pathological tissues and paired normal tissues of NSCLC was evaluated using a quantitative real-time RT-PCR. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was demonstrated following a log-rank test. Results showed that miR-222 expression level is up-regulated in NSCLC tissues compared with matched normal tissues (mean +/- SD: 3.55 +/- 1.71vs. 2.08 +/- 1.01, P < 0.001). The high expression of miR-222 in NSCLC cancer tissues was also remarkably related with aggressive clinic pathological features. The expression level of miR-222 was associated with tumor grade (P= 0.031) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0028). Moreover, the results of Kaplan-Meier analyses indicated that patients with high expression level of microRNA-222 had shorter overall survival and progression free survival (P < 0.001). The multivariate analysis clearly indicated that the high miR-222 expression in biopsy samples might be a useful independent biomarker for NSCLC prognosis (RR 3.23; 95% CI, 2.12-5.47). Our data demonstrated that the aberrant expression of microRNA-222 is associated with NSCLC progression and it might be a potential biomarker for NSCLC prognosis.

AB Lung carcinoma represents the most deadly type of cancer worldwide. Increasing evidence suggests that microRNAs, a novel class of non-coding RNAs that function as endogenous suppressors of gene expression, are deregulated in non-small cell lung cancer. Although microRNA-222 overexpression has been described in NSCLC, the role of miR-222 and its target genes in erlotinib resistant PC-9 (PC-9/ER) cells remain poorly elucidated. Here we established miR-222 overexpression and low expression models by transfection with miR-222 mimic, inhibitor or their negative controls. Cell proliferation was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and EdU incorporation assay.
   MiR-222 and its putative target gene p27 expression level were determined using qRT-PCR and/or Western blot. MiR-222 overexpression induced an enhancement of PC-9/ER proliferation in vitro. P27 expression was negatively regulated by miR-222 overexpression at post-transcriptional level in PC-9/ER cells. Transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) for p27 increased PC-9/ER cell proliferation rate, validating that p27 is a target gene of miR-222 during PC-9/ER cell proliferation. This study suggests that miR-222 may regulate the acquired resistance of PC-9/ER cells to erlotinib by down-regulating p27. Inhibition of miR-222 might be a novel therapeutic strategy for TKI-resistant NSCLC.

AB Background: Thrombosis is triggered by a shift in the balance of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors due to acquired or inherited causes. Factor XIII plays an important role in the stabilization of the linkage between fibrins. Three different genetic structure of Valine34Leucine polymorphism in FXIIIA have been described. Valine/Valine structure has been identified as the homozygous normal (wild-type), whereas Valine/Leucine and Leucine/Leucine structures have been identified as heterozygous and homozygous mutants respectively. Genetic polymorphisms in FXIII-A subunit vary substantially from society to society. The primary objective of this study was to determine the relationship between factor XIII polymorphisms and arterial/venous thromboembolism in the southeast of Turkey.
   Methods: A total of 127 patients with arterial and venous thrombosis were included as the study group and 102 healthy subjects with no thromboembolic disorders were included as the control group. Val34Leu polymorphism in FXIII was investigated in both groups using PCR (Polymerase chain reaction).
   Results: The prevalence of the polymorphism in the study and control groups were compared with chi-square test, no statistically significant differences were found (the prevalence in the study and control group are 68.5% and 66.7% for V/V allele, 29.2% and 29.4% for V/L allele, and 2.4% and 3.9% in L/L allele respectively, with p = 0.787). When deep vein thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed female patients group (n = 8) was compared to the healthy female control group, V/L allele was significantly lower, whereas L/L allele was significantly higher (p = < 0.01).
   Conclusions: This study indicates that there is no evidence for association between factor XIII-A Val34Leu polymorphism and arterial/venous thromboembolism. The significant result we found for the DVT patients should be strengthened by further studies with greater number of cases. In future, further studies are needed with more specific groups and with greater numbers of patients.

AB Introduction: Radiation induced sarcoma (RIS) is a long-term complication of radiation therapy. Its incidence, 5 years after treatment, is 0.03-0.2%. This risk is related to radiation dose, concomitant alkylating agents and genetic factors.
   Case presentation: We report the case of a 33-year-old woman with synchronous gastric (adenocarcinoma, intestinal type, T3N2M0, Stage 3A) and right-sided breast cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), T2N1M0, Cerb2 (+++), Stage 2B) who received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) and radiotherapy (RT) to stomach and breast. At the 22nd month after RT, pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma was diagnosed at the right thoracic wall including axillary region (field of RT) synchronously with the left sided breast cancer. After adjuvant CT, first she received chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) for gastric cancer. After that she received complex RT to breast region (right supraclavicular fossa single front plan, tangential fields bolus), a total of 5000 cGy as 200 cGy/day X 25 fractions to right chest wall and a total dose as 5000 cGy to posterior axillary region. During follow-up, a 3 cm lesion at right axilla and a BIRADS 4A lesion in her left breast were determined. Sarcoma in right axilla and IDC in left breast were reported after biopsy. Patient underwent surgery at the same session.
   Conclusion: Although post-radiation sarcomas are rare complications with poor prognosis, enhanced awareness and early detection by clinicians are essential to improve outcomes via curative surgical resection. Latent period is expressed with years, but in our case RIS was developed after a short time with 22 months.

AB Background: The role of molecular markers in ovarian cancer is still a matter of debate. This study was conducted to determine the clinical significance of serum Omentin-1 in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients in the current matched case-control study.
   Material and methods: Fourty-one patients with advanced EOC and 41 healthy people were included in the study. Serum Omentin values were measured by quantitative ELISA method.
   Results: The median serum Omentin-1 values was 46.6 pg/ml in patients and this was significantly higher than healthy controls (median 35.5) (p=0.045). There was positive correlation between serum omentin and serum CA-125 levels (r = 0.34, p =0.028). We found no relationship between serum Omentin-1 levels and any prognostic parameters analyzed, including age of the patients, histology, tumor grade, stage of the disease, debulking surgery and response to chemotherapy. Survival analysis did not show statistically significant effect of serum Omentin-1 level on overall survival (p = 0.91)
   Conclusions: These results indicated that serum Omentin-1 values were significantly elevated in patients with advanced overian carcinoma compared to healthy people. Further studies with a greater number of patients are required to confirm the importance of serum Omentin-1 levels in ovarian cancer.

AB Introduction: Gestational diabetes is defined as glucose intolerance first recognized in pregnancy. Oral glucose tolerance testing is the cornerstone in diagnosing gestational diabetes. In this study, we aimed to find a new method of diagnosis in addition to conventional diagnosed by 75 gr oral glucose tolerance testing.
   Material and methods: 121 pregnant woman were included part in this study, forming two groups as gestational diabetic patients (51 patients) and control group (70 pregnant woman). Both kidneys are evaluated with B Mode Ultrasound and Colour Doppler Ultrasound mode by measuring resistive index for depiction of other renal pathologies. Stiffness of renal tissue determined by Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) technology utilized by two blinded radiology specialists.
   Results: We were not able to find any correlation between gestational diabetes mellitus and resistivity index measurements (p > 0.05). But a correlation between second hour glucose levels in oral glucose tolerance test and bilateral renal stiffness was found (p < 0,05).
   Conclusion: ARFI ultrasound may be a non-invasive technique in determining the course of the disease.

AB Introduction: Dyspnea is a frequent and devastating symptom among patients with cancer, and is a prognostic indicator of survival. The management of cancer-related dyspnea remains a challenge due to lacking systematic guidelines for clinical care. The mainstay of cancer related dyspnea palliation is being considered altering central perception, and morphine is still the first choice of therapy. Conventional management of cancer related dyspnea might not be suitable for emergency department. Palliative treatment of a cancer patient shouldn't always be planned as end of live care in the ED. There has been no study published that describes the efficacy of bronchodilators or respiratory muscle relaxants inpatients experiencing dyspnea with lung cancer. The aim of the study was to determine effect of salbutamol, beta 2 agonist and magnesium sulfate, respiratory muscle relaxants for improvement on respiratory capacity in patients with lung cancer.
   Methods: This was a randomized, double blind clinical trial. Adult patients with lung cancer, with a Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) of <250 L/min, who did not receive bronchodilators and not requiring assisted ventilation were included. Patients were randomized to receive either serial three doses of 2.5 mg salbutamol plus 1500 mg magnesium sulfate in IV 100 mL 0.9% NaCl or serial three doses of 2.5 mg salbutamol plus 100 mL IV 0.9% NaCl. We defined the primary outcome measures as the changes in PEFR and Fischl index over time (at 0 and 120 min).
   Results: Salbutamol therapy increased mean PEFR from 127.4 liters/minute to 169.4 liters/minute (p<0.01), while salbutamol plus magnesium therapy increased it from 131.1 to 174.9 liters/minute (p<0.01). Both therapies resulted in improvement in Fischl Scores. After treatment PEFR and Fischl Scores were similar between the two groups (p=0.74, p=0.19).
   Conclusion: Optimal management of dyspnea in cancer patients requires an understanding of the causes and decision-making process must consider of the patient's general condition, the presence and severity of symptoms. The results of this study revealed, salbutamol, a non-opioid, beta 2-agonist agent, provided significant improvement on respiratory capacity in patients with cancer related dyspnea. However, adding IV Magnesium therapy to nebulized salbutamol has no beneficial effect.

AB Introduction: Hypertension and obesity are threatening facts of public health in the Turkish community; hence it is lifesaving to carry out blood pressure and upper body measurements for early determination of cardiovascular risks. The aim of this study was to determine prevalence of prehypertension and its association with neck and abdominal obesity in disease-free young adults.
   Materials and methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in an urban public university of Turkey. The anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were obtained from 704 healthy disease-free young adults. Comparisons among blood pressure groups were done with the Chi-square test. Multivariate regression analysis was carried out to determine risk factors for prehypertension. The Pearson correlation was employed to determine correlation between the prehypertension and anthropometric measurements. P<0.05 values were considered as statistically significant.
   Results: The overall prevalence of prehypertension was 49.0%, 53.1% in males and 44.9% in females. Prevalence of prehypertension was significantly higher in males comparison to females (p<0.001). The overall prevalence of neck obesity, abdominal obesity and overweight/obesity was 18.2%, 6.1% and 23.0% respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that neck circumference was the strongest predictor of prehypertension among other obesity indicators. Prehypertension was positively correlated with neck circumference, waist circumference and Body Mass Index for both sexes (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: Public health interventions are needed to prevent prehypertension and obesity in young adults. Further research should focus on determining prehypertension, neck and abdominal obesity which will decrease probable cardiovascular risks in young populations.

AB Introduction: The burden of cardiovascular disease an increasing public health problem worldwide as such in Turkey. This epidemiologic study was performed to determine co-existence of lipitension and central obesity among primary care patients.
   Materials and methods: A single-center retrospective case-control study was conducted in a population recruited from a family health center in year 2016. A total of 204 individuals with central obesity were matched on gender and age (+/- 2 years) with controls without central obesity. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between lipitension and central obesity.
   Results: The prevalence of dyslipidemia, hypertension and lipitension in all participants was 60.8%, 40.4% and 23.3% respectively. Among cases, the prevalence of central obesity was 36% among women and 24.4% among men. The prevalence of lipitension in central obesity was 37.3% in this study. Lipitension risk was 1.75 fold higher in men than women. In particular, central obesity was strongly associated with lipitension (OR, 4.75; 95% CI, 2.87-7.87).
   Conclusions: The considerably high prevalence of lipitension and central obesity among the primary care population aged and over 30 invites to us for effective preventive measures and public health framework urgently.

AB Objective: Diminished bone mineral density in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have increased risk for osteoporosis and its associated fractures. Even though the relationship between different phenotypes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bone mineral density was not fully understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate bone mineral density in different phenotypes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and compare these outcomes with an age-correlated control group.
   Methods: In this retrospective study 100 patients (emphysematous, chronic bronchitis and healthy control group) were participated. Participants underwent DXA absorptiometry to evaluate bone mineral density. Spirometric pulmonary function tests, 6-minute walk test, bode index, and modified medical research council dyspnea score, body mass index and levels of calcium, vitamin D and parathormone were also evaluated. Comparative assessment of the findings was performed and statistical analysis was applied in present study.
   Results: Patients with the emphysematous phenotype had significantly lower femur bone mineral density (P = 0.05), body mass index (P < 0.05), than chronic bronchitis phenotype. Inverse correlations were revealed between lumbar bone mineral density and modified medical research council dyspnea score. Statistical analysis was performed by the multivariate logistic regression analysis model test and Tukey tests (p < 0.05). On ANOVA analysis, the emphysematous group have two fold higher risk of osteoporosis and lower bone mineral density detected than other groups(OR 1.947, 95% CI (1.009-3.792), P = 0.081; OR, 1.863,95% CI (1.027-3.274), P = 0.037).
   Conclusion: The evaluation of bone loss rate among groups, emphysematous phenotype had more risk in developing osteoporosis, low bone mineral density and a little less osteopenia than other groups.

AB Objective: The study aimed to explore the protective effects of astragaloside against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.
   Methods: Rats were randomly divided into six groups: saline control group (control), bleomycin group (BLM), bleomycin added astragaloside at 20 mg/kg.bw (BLM+AS20), bleomycin added astragaloside at 40 mg/kg.bw (BLM+AS40), bleomycin added astragaloside at 60 mg/kg.bw (BLM+AS60), bleomycin added dexamethasone (DE). On Day 3, 7, 14 and 28, eight rats in each group were respectively sacrificed to collect lung samples for further analysis. The activity of PLA2, hydroxyproline content and the content of PGE2, LTC4, TGF-beta 1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured on different days. HE-staining and optical microscopy were performed to examine the pathological changes in lungs.
   Results: The activity of PLA2, hydroxyproline content and PGE2, LTC4, TGF-beta 1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were obviously increased for BLM group compared to the control group. Compared with the BLM group, AS treatment groups significantly alleviated all the above negative changes exited in the BLM group in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the pathological injury was also gradually improved by AS treatment compared with the BLM rats, which was similar to the dexamethasone group.
   Conclusion: Our study suggested a therapeutic potential of AS in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.

AB Introduction: Patients with cardiac myxoma typically present with one or more of the classic triad of obstructive, embolic and constitutional symptoms, but rarely present with fever of unknown origin. The clinical features, diagnotic dilemmas and management strategies of this rare condition have not been sufficiently elucidated.
   Materials and methods: A comprehensive literature collection resulted in 58 pertinent articles with 62 patients, which constitute the study material of this research.
   Results: Fever in this patient setting during hospitalization was 38.8 +/- 0.7 (range, 37.4-40; median, 38.9)degrees C. The duration of fever was 6.4 +/- 14.6 months. The time interval from the onset to the diagnosis of cardiac myxoma was 6.0 +/- 6.1 months, and from physician consultation to the diagnosis was 1.4 +/- 2.6 months. Poor responses to antimicrobial therapies were observed in at least 35% of the patients, and 4.9% were otherwise managed. Surgical resection of cardiac myxoma was performed in 48 (88.9%). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed an overall survival rate of 87.0% with a survival of 95.5% in surgical and 16.7% in nonsurgical groups.
   Conclusion: Patients with cardiac myxoma presenting with fever of unknown origin pose challenges due to the nonspecific clinical manifestation. Elevated circulating levels of the inflammatory biomarkers including C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 are helpful in differential diagnosis between cardiac myxoma with FUO and infected cardiac myxoma. An early diagnosis of cardiac myxoma with FUO relies on a timely echocardiographic investigation. Due to its poor response to antibiotic therapy and immediate subside of fever following cardiac myxoma resection, a prompt surgical treatment is recommended up diagnosis is made.

AB Introduction: Congenital supravalvular pulmonary stenosis (SVPS) is rare, whereas acquired SVPS is increasingly reported due to surgical repair of complex congenital heart defects specially developed for pediatric patients and prolonged follow-up. The clinical features and the genetic basis of this entity are scantily described.
   Materials and methods: Comprehensive literature retrieval for collecting articles published in English from 2000 to 2016 was the research material of this article.
   Results: A total of 34 articles were collected with 333 patients involved: 20 (6.0%) of the SVPS cases were congenital and 313 (94.0%) were acquired. Totally 12 (3.6%) patients were in association with syndromes. Postoperative SVPS occured at a mean of 82.7 months following the surgical operation. Management strategies for postoperative SVPS were medical in 1.6%, interventional in 55.6%, surgical in 41.1% and hybrid in 0.8% of the patients. The reintervention rate was 15.9% in the interventional group. The overall mortality was 0.6%.
   Conclusion: The incidence of postoperative SVPS depends on the follow-up period after surgical operation and the diagnostic criteria of SVPS. For avoiding postoperative SVPS, careful preoperative assessment of the potential surgical outcomes in relation to clinical, hemodynamic, morphological and genetic investigations is mandatory for the decision-making of choices of optimal operative techniques.

AB Introduction: Acute cholecystitis (AC) is the acute inflammation of the gallbladder wall. Tokyo guidelines provide criteria for the diagnosis and classification of AC. We aimed this study to identify the role of C-reactive protein (CRP) in determining the severity of AC and determine cut-off levels for each group.
   Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis was made of 236 patients diagnosed with AC between January 2009 and January 2015. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Tokyo classification. CRP values of the patients were analyzed and compared among the groups.
   Results: Disease severity was determined as mild in 57.6%, moderate in 28.8% and severe in 13.6% of the patients. The mean age was 53.7 +/- 18.3 years and the clinical picture was seen to become more severe with increasing age (p<0.05). CRP values of the patients were determined to rise with increasing grade (p<0.05). There was no relationship between CRP and white blood cell (WBC) (p>0.05). The CRP cut-off values were determined as 0.815 mg/dl (sensitivity 44.9%, specificity 34%) for the Grade 1 patient group, 1.095 mg/dl (sensitivity 57.4%, specificity 57.7%) for the Grade 2 patient group and 2.095 mg/dl (sensitivity 71.9%, specificity 69.6%) for the Grade 3 patient group.
   Conclusion: CRP values may be useful in assessing the severity of AC, and may be considered to be a parameter that could be added to the Tokyo classification.

AB This study was conducted with the aim of comparing the four methods of cognitive, medical, and integrative (cognitive + medical) and placebo therapy in the treatment of depression resulting from generalized anxiety disorder. The study population included all of those referents (men and women) to the public and private psychotherapy and counseling centers in Tonekabon that 40 individuals were selected from among the statistical population and were randomly assigned to four treatment groups of 10 people. The design of the present study was quasi-experimental and data collection instruments were Beck's Depression Inventory Short Form and Hamilton's Rating Scale. The results of the analysis of statistical data of the research showed that all of the four methods of therapy have been effective whether at the end of 2 months period of therapy or during preventive period in reducing depression along with generalized anxiety disorder but the effectiveness of the integrative therapy method regarding the three methods of medical, cognitive and placebo was not confirmed.

AB Introduction: Red cell distribution width (RDW) has been reported as a prognostic marker in many clinical conditions. Mortality prediction of intensive care unit (ICU) patients is challenging and in this study we aimed to assess the value of RDW in predicting mortality of adult ICU patients.
   Materials and methods: RDW values and outcomes of ICU patients from former study were retrospectively collected from medical records. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II scores were calculated according to data obtained from medical charts.
   Results: 81 patients of the former study were screened for eligibility and 58 of them were enrolled. Mean age was 69.0 +/- 15.42 years (95 % CI; 30-90) and 55.2 % were male. There were 26 patients in the survivor group and 32 patients were in the non-survivor group. Regression analysis showed no association between mortality and initial RDW values. However, RDW values of last ICU day showed a positive correlation with mortality. APACHE II, SOFA, and SAPS II scores were higher in non-survivor patients than survivors.
   Conclusion: Whilst there was some correlation between RDW at the end of stay and mortality, RDW had no benefit over existing scoring systems.RDW value does not seem as a promising independent factor but further studies investigating its contribution to current scoring systemsin specific groups can be reasonable.

DE breast cancer; breast self-examination (BSE); SMS; female students
AB SMS is the simplest and most cost-effective method of promoting knowledge of how to prevent diseases and face them in a healthy manner used by the public in educational programs regarding health. In this study, the performance of Breast Self-Examination (BSE) using SMS is investigated in female students majoring in engineering and humanitarian sciences of Tarbiat Modarres University (2013). For this purpose, 108 individuals aged 22-30 were selected into two groups using random cluster sampling. The educational program was compiled using information from pre-test and after determining public educational requirements regarding research. The two groups were then tested simultaneously and the posttest (3 months after training) was taken. The data were then analyzed on a significant level (P<0.005) using SPSS20 software and statistical parametrical (t-pair) and non-parametrical test (chi-square). The t-test results indicated that compared with pre-education phase, both groups had significant differences in average score of knowledge, attitude, and performance regarding BSE (P <= 0.001). The results also showed that knowledge, attitude, and performance of breast cancer and how BSE was performed through SMS was higher in student of humanitarian sciences compared to engineering students (P <= 0.001).

AB Background and subjunctives: Nurses experience a wide range of stress during their working life and due to their job which makes them be highly skilled, do team work in different situations, provide 24-hour care and also be emotional. Nurses working in the operating room, because of the nature of their work, suffer more stress than the others working in different sectors in the hospital which as a result can lead to a desire to leave the nursing profession. This study has been done to identify the correlation between job stress and turnover intentions among the operating room nurses in selected hospitals of Tehran University of Medical Science.
   Method: This is a kind of descriptive-solidarity study, which was done on 230 workers of nursing staff working in the operating room in selected hospitals of Tehran University of Medical Science. Demographic and Occupational Questionnaire, Osipow Job Stress Questionnaire and Henshaw Scale Turnover Forecast have been used to gather data. The analysis of the data from this study was done by using the SPSS software, version 21, using Descriptive Statistics, Statistical Test and also Gamma Correlation Coefficient and Correlation Coefficient Significant Test was used to investigate the variables.
   Findings: In the survey conducted, generally in 94.6% of nurses job stress was assessed average. In 42.9% of nurses turnover intentions were moderate, and also there was a significant relation between job stress and turnover intentions (p= 0.002).
   Conclusion: In their jobs, nurses encounter stressful factors, which affect their general health that can lead to an increase in turnover intentions. So Health authorities should consider specific measures in order to reduce and defuse the existing tension and also create a better and more appropriate condition for nurses and stop them from turnover intensions.

AB Introduction: Malnutrition is quite common in peritoneal dialysis patients and is associated with high mortality. Bioimpedance indices and phase angle are used frequently in nutritional studies. Phase angle measured by bioimpedance analysis indicates body cell mass and soft tissue mass and changes in the quality and quantity of the mass; therefore, it is used as a nutritional marker. We aimed to evaluate nutritional status of peritoneal dialysis patients by bioimpedance analysis.
   Materials and methods: 38 peritoneal dialysis patients and 37 healthy individuals were studied. All individuals' bioimpedance indices, phase angle measurements (800 mu A current, 50 kHz frequency) were carried out by using multifrequency bioimpedance device. Nutritional biochemical markers were measured.
   Results: Peritoneal and control group phase angle were detected 4.48 +/- 0.86 and 5.97 +/- 0.85, respectively (p<0.001). Albumin, total protein, transferrin, potassium, calcium, hemoglobin, HDL-cholesterol levels were significantly lower in peritoneal group. The mean normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) was found to be 1.41 +/- 0.44 g/kg/day, in peritoneal dialysis patients. There was a significant positive correlation between phase angle and nPCR (p=0.001, r=0.516). Phase angle was positively correlated with total protein, transferrin, potassium, hemoglobin, body cell mass/weight (%), lean tissue mass/weight (%), lean tissue index, body cell mass/weight (%), and negatively correlated with age, creatinine, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, C-reactive protein, fat tissue mass/weight (%), fat tissue index. Independent predictors of phase angle were albumin, age and lean tissue index revealed in regression analysis.
   Conclusion: Phase angle was significantly lower in peritoneal dialysis patients. Bioimpedance parameters, especially phase angle reflect the nutritional status in peritoneal dialysis patients.

DE hydatid cyst rupture; seizure; trauma
AB Introduction: Diagnosis and treatment of a hydatid cyst continues to be a problem in endemic areas, such as Turkey. Hydatid cyst rupture into the peritoneum can cause severe anaphylactic reactions. The most common cause of intraperitoneal hydatid cyst rupture is cyst rupture occurring after trauma.
   Case presentation: A 25-year-old male patient was brought to the emergency department with a complaint of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure while he was in the bathroom. For 3 days he had been receiving treatment for an influenza infection. His vital signs were blood pressure 140/70 mmHg, pulse 90/min, temperature 37 degrees C, O2 saturation 95%. The patient's physical examination was normal, and his electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm. His cranial computed tomography was normal. His laboratory findings were normal except for hyponatremia, and fluid-electrolyte treatment was provided. During monitoring, he did not develop any acute problem, his hyponatremia resolved and he was discharged with suggestions. The patient was found dead in his bed 5 hours after discharge. The autopsy showed that his death occurred due to a hydatid cyst rupture in his liver.
   Conclusion: We concluded that the rupture was caused by a minimal trauma occurring during possible tonic-clonic convulsions. This condition should always be considered in a differential diagnosis in Turkey, where hydatid cyst cases are common.

   Materials and methods: Twenty-eight rats were divided into four groups each containing seven rats: Control groups (Group 1: Olive oil group, Group 2: Olive oil+NAC group) and experimental groups (Group 3: CCl4 group, Group 4: CCl4+NAC group). CCl4 was given in 1 ml/kg doses intraperitoneally (i.p.), NAC was given in 50 mg/kg doses. Oligosaccharide units were detected histochemically using biotin labeled lectins.
   Results: Histochemically, NAC showed no remarkable effect on the staining intensity of biotin labeled lectins. Liver enzyme activities and plasma protein levels were measured using commercial available kits. Compared to the control group in CCl4 given rats AST, GGT and ALP activities increased significantly (P<0.001), while NAC administration alleviated the toxic effects of CCl4. CCl4 decreased serum albumin concentration significantly (P<0.05), however NAC annihilated negative effect of CCl4 on albumin concentration. The alterations in total protein levels and ALT activities remained insignificant (P>0.05).
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that cells may increase their oligosaccharide units to protect themselves from the toxic effects of CCl4 and NAC may support cells to scavenge free radicals induced by CCl4.

AB Introduction: The potential effects of serum albumin and albumin-globulin rate on survival were investigated in patients with gastric carcinoma.
   Materials and methods: The biochemical values of 204 patients under chemotherapy evaluation were obtained retrospectively from archive data. Albumin-globulin ratio values were calculated using albumin/total protein-albumin formula. The values of albumin-globulin ratio and albumin were categorized as 3 groups using receiver operating characteristic analysis and a descending order.
   Results: The calculated cut-off value for albumin-globulin ratio was 1.14: 34.4-79.7 by receiver operating characteristic. The median survival was 20.7 months (15.9-25.5), 20.1 months (15.1-25.1), 16 months (11.8-20.1), respectively in 1st, 2nd, 3rd groups for albumin-globulin ratio (p=0.46). The median overall survival was 18.3 months (123-24.2), 21.6 months (16.8-26.3), 18.01 months (13.5-22.4) in 1st, 2nd, 3rd groups for albumin, respectively (p=0.52). There were no statistical significant differences by Kaplan-Meier method for albumin-globulin ratio, albumin p>0.05. The effects of clinicopathological and biochemical characteristics on mortality were assessed by Cox-proportional hazard regression analysis. The independent predictors of mortality were observed high grade, the presence of perineural invasion of the tumor, high nodal involvement (p:0.01, p:0.001, p:0.01), respectively.
   Conclusion: Albumin-globulin ratio and albumin values alone may not be useful parameters to predict mortality and survival in patients with gastric carcinoma.

AB Background: The aim of this study is to determine level of anxiety symptoms of patients who were admitted to cardiology clinics and to understand the distribution of symptoms and to research the related factors.
   Methods: This is a basic, sectional and descriptive study. Stationary population of this study was patients who were admitted to cardiology inpatient and outpatient clinics of Tepecik Educational and Research Hospital between 01.06.2013 and 31.07.2013. A socio-demographic questionnaire and the Turkish version of Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAS) were given to patients by interviewer.
   Results: In the study, there were 101 participants aged between 18-65.61 participants (60.4%) were admitted to outpatient clinic and 40 participants (39.6%) were admitted to inpatient clinic. 79.2% of participants in the study had ischemic heart disease. The mean of HAS scores of the participants was 10.28 +/- 6.21 (min:0, max:26). 27 participants (26.7%) had no anxiety. 49 (485%) participants had mild anxiety and 25 (24.8%) participants had severe anxiety. As for gender, the anxiety average score of the male patients was statistically lower than those of the female patients (p<0.05). When it comes to family history of the psychiatric disease, the anxiety levels of the patients showed a statistical significance (p<0.05). As to drug use, the difference was statistically significant between the groups (p<0.05). The anxiety average score of the patients who have a healthy nutritional status was statistically lower (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: For the patients diagnosed with anxiety, doctors must be aware of the risk factors like gender, family history of psychiatric disease, drug use and nutritional status.

AB Introduction and objectives: Due to its extensive and effective functions, the role of self-care and special attention to non-medical expectations cause an increase in people's expectation of security provision and enhancement, quality and justice, and pressure to establish a responsive health system. With a focus on health and spending abundant resources in treatment and equipping hospitals, in practice health transformation plan has minimized attention in the field of health and prevention. Therefore, the present study was aimed at identifying health and prevention challenges and threats in the health transformation plan.
   Materials and methods: The present study was a qualitative one in which a non-random purposive sampling was employed in order to select scholars in the field of health in the academic year of 2014-2015. The required data were collected through semi-structured interviews and then analyzed by a content analysis method using MAXQDA 11.0.
   Results: After the collected data were analyzed, 296 themes were obtained which were encoded through 2 categories of challenges and solutions, and the items led to the formation of 87 primary coded, 8 categories, and 2 themes of factors and challenges and improvement solutions.
   Discussion and conclusion: The results of the study can be used as an appropriate solution for policymakers and planners in order to enhance the quality of health services according to the country's twenty-year outlook aimed at specifying the features of the Iranian healthy society, an important part of which is the possession of healthy life with appropriate quality and healthy environment which is aimed to be achieved in the second phase of the health system transformation plan and provide necessary requirements to obtain the first place in economy, science, and technology in the region.

AB Introduction: Warfarin, the most commonly used oral anticoagulant worldwide. Bleeding represents the most significant complication of warfarin therapy. The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacies of Human Prothrombin Complex (PCC) and Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) for reversal of warfarin-induced anticoagulant effect in the emergency department.
   Materials and methods: This observational, retrospective study was retrospectively conducted at Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Training and Research Hospital. The study included 32 patients aged over 18 years who presented to the emergency department with warfarin-induced INR elevation and major bleeding. The patients were divided into PCC (Group 1) and FFP (Group 2) groups. The two groups were compared with each other with respect to age, gender distribution, duration of emergency department stay, warfarin dosing schedule (mg/day), bleeding site, amount of PCC (number*10 ml/IU) or FFP (number*200 ml) used for treatment, pre-treatment INR, aPTT levels, and INR, PT, and aPTT levels 15 minutes after FFP and 240 minutes after PCC administration.
   Results: The two groups were not significantly different with respect to age and gender distribution (p > 0.05). PCC group had an average duration of emergency department stay of 4.8 hours whereas FFP group had an average duration of emergency department stay of 12.25 hours (p<0.05). The number and cost of PCC was significantly greater than FFP (p<0.05). However, the volume of drug was significantly lower in the PCC group (p<0.05)
   Conclusion: PCC has a limited role in clinical practice due to its cost and limited availability. However, with the possible exceptions of blood transmissible diseases, volume loading, and loss of time, administration of a combination of FFP and vitamin K is not a medically inappropriate practice.

AB Introduction: Blood transfusion and component therapies are life-saving medical practices. However these therapies, are not without risks and may lead to the transmission of infectious agents from donor to recipient. Screening of blood donations for infectious agents is necessary to achieve transfusion safety. The aim of the study was to determine the six-years seroprevalence of HBV (hepatitis B virus), HCV (hepatitis C virus), HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), and syphilis in blood donors and to present an overview of transfusion transmitted infections in Turkey.
   Material and methods: A total of 150,787 volunteer blood donors who admitted to blood centers located in Eastern Marmara Region, Turkey between January 2009 and October 2014 were included in this study. HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), anti-HCV (hepatitis C virus antibody), and HIV-1/2 antibody were detected by using Chemiluminescent Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (CMIA) method.. Syphilis screening was performed by using VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) test in the first three years and by CMIA-based treponemal test in the last three years.
   Results: Among the blood donors, 140,536 (93.2%) were male and 10,251 (6.8%) female. Out of all donors, 2,019 (1.33%) donors were positive for at least one screening test. The seroprevalence of HBV, HCV, HIV, and syphilis were 0.8 % (n=1340), 0.38% (n=578), 0,0025% (n=38) and 0,004 % (n=63), respectively. A significant decrease was observed in HBV seroprevalence by years (p <0.005)
   Conclusion: The risk of transfusion-transmitted infections can be decreased by effectively using questionnaires and screening tests in blood donation centers, HBV vaccination programs, and awareness-raising activities. It is necessary to use improved screening methods for detection of transfusion-transmitted infection agents.

AB Background: Children with epilepsy and their families are engaged in the process of treating their condition, and are experiencing the consequences of this disease. Epilepsy can have many negative effects on various aspects of all family members' lives, particularly the parents. No qualitative study before was performed on parents of children with epilepsy. From that nurses should be aware about this client's life word for better caring, this study designed.
   Objectives: This study aimed at exploring experience of parents of children with epilepsy.
   Patients and methods: This study guided by Van Manen's method of doing phenomenological study. Purposive sampling with maximum variation sampling strategy was used. 10 people participated. The data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews, which were conducted face-to-face with individuals in a quiet room. The interviews were conducted at participants' place and time of choice, and lasted 35 to 100 min.
   Results: The main theme emerged in this study was "fenced in by the child disease". Parents of children with epilepsy have numerous problems; strongly affect the routine of their lives. Our study shows this parents life are deeply affected by child disease. Limitation in relationships, travel restrictions, drop out from school, leaving the job are four sub themes emerged in this study.
   Conclusions: There is also a need to pay special attention to these families and provide help to them in the Iranian health system, such as using nurses as the large part of the system to relive their pain. Providing counseling for, and educating these parents and using mass media to increase public awareness about epilepsy is also necessary.

AB Introduction: Cavernous hemangioma of the adrenal gland is a rare benign tumor characterized by the presence of blood-filled, dilated vascular spaces. These adrenal masses are usually non-functioning and the patients have no symptoms so the diagnosis is incidental.
   Methods: We performed a systematic literature review for all articles published until April 2015. The initial search identified 98 publications. We considered some characteristics: the mean age of the patients at diagnosis was 59 years (range 19 - 84); there were approximately 1.7 times more female patients than male patients; mean diameter of the lesions was 10.3 cm (range 2 - 25). Surgical treatment was more often open with midline or subcostal
   Results: From literature analysis we know that small adrenal hemangiomas are usually asymptomatic. Only four patients in our literature review show endocrinologic disturbances with three cases of subclinical Cushing's syndrome and a case of hyperaldosteronism. The pre-operative radiologic features play a fundamental role for correct surgical approach. On enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) scan adrenal hemangiomas tend to be heterogeneous, hypodense lesions with high-density rim of tissue at the periphery. On Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) common findings associated with adrenal hemangiomas are hypointense inhomogeneous masses with central hyperintensity on T1 images and a high intensity peripheral rim on T2 images due to hemorrhage or necrosis.
   Conclusion: Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is considered the standard treatment in case of benign lesions. Some authors suggest that the main limitation during laparoscopic dissection for large and potentially malign adrenal tumors is incomplete resection and capsular disruption with increased risk of local recurrence and intra-abdominal neoplastic dissemination. We recommend for these patients an integrated multidisciplinary approach that considers endocrine studies, preoperative radiologic findings and the experience of surgical team.

AB Regular physical activity can be an efficient method for prevention for anxiety. The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of 8 weeks of sport rock climbing (SRC) training on anxiety in healthy sedentary adults. A total number of nineteen students participated in this study voluntarily composing of a control group (CG, n=10, age 21.90 +/- 1.66 years, height 168.50 +/- 4.40 cm, weight 61.18 +/- 7.08 kg) and an experimental group (EG, n=9, age 21.11 +/- 2.31 years, height 167.33 +/- 6.44 cm, weight 59.31 +/- 8.39 kg). After the EG had been taught basic climbing and rope techniques, body composition and aerobic power measurements were taken for both groups. The EG engaged in climbing training by using a top-rope method for 60 minutes a day with an intensity level of 70 % of HR reserve, three days a week for eight weeks. The CG did not engage in any systematic physical activity program during the study. The Competitive Sport Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2) was given to participants twice. The EG completed the Inventory 20 minutes before the first and the last climbing trial. The CG completed the Inventories on first and last day of 8 weeks period. The results indicated significant changes in all CSAI-2 results for EG, including cognitive (p_=_0.002) and somatic anxiety (p_=_0.032) reduced, self-confidence (p_=_0.001) increased. This current study is one of the first research efforts examining the psychological effects of eight weeks SRC training. Results demonstrated that eight weeks of SRC training significantly reduces cognitive and somatic anxiety and increases self-confidence. In addition to the psychological effects, eight weeks of SRC training also improved the VO2max of participants. This study suggests that SRC can be useful as a regular physical activity in controlling and improving anxiety in the study sample.

AB Introduction: The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of single Wingate anaerobic test on heart rate variability (HRV) parameters at 162 m, 1015 m, 2146 m, and 3085 m of altitudes, and to understand how normobaric hypoxia affect the autonomic nervous system.
   Material and methods: A total number of 21 (10 male, 11 female) physically active adult college students participated in this study voluntarily. After the informed consent forms were filled out by all participants, and their body composition was measured in the first visit, subjects visited the laboratory four more times with the 2 days of intervals. In every visit a participant's HRV measurement was collected after the hypoxia mask was placed on his/her face, and participant was taken to Wingate Anaerobic Test with the mask. Immediately after the Wingate Anaerobic Test, the HRV was collected again. This procedure was applied at 162 m, 1015 m, 2146 m, and 3085 m of altitude randomly.
   Results: Despite the fact that all HRV values were significantly different in the comparisons of pre- and post-test results, no change was found in any of SDNN, SDSD, RMSSD, TP, HF, LF/HF, HF, HFnu, LF, LFnu, and VLF parameters depending on the different altitudes. We also found no change on anaerobic power levels.
   Conclusion: In accordance with the present findings of the study it could be concluded that to exposure to normobaric hypoxia at 162 m, 1015 m, 2146 m, and 3085 m had no additional effect on both autonomic nervous system determined by using HRV measurement and anaerobic performance.

AB Introduction: Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the first and rate restricting enzyme in the hexose monophosphate shunt. Malondialdehyde (MDA) generated through decomposition of peroxided lipids influences the intrinsic mechanical properties of the red blood cell (RBC) membrane, which leads to reduced deformability. In this study we investigated effect of MDA on G6PD activity and membrane protein abnormalities in vitro.
   Materials and methods: The hematological findings were obtained by a blood cell counter and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) for 47 cases. G6PD enzyme activity was measured with Bender's et al. method and MDA levels in plasma were measured by thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assay. Erythrocyte ghosts were prepared according to Dodge et al. method and membrane proteins were separated using on 8.3 % SDS-PAGE. DNA samples were isolated from white blood cells as described by Poncz et al. method to perform amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assays.
   Results: Total 47 cases were examined as a G6PD deficient, anemic and normal group in this study and found no correlation between parameters statistically. In addition, we found no differences between groups about G6PD, MDA and some RBCs membrane proteins data. Moreover, we found differences between groups to G6PD deficient and anemic or normal samples for spectrin membrane protein data and between normal and G6PD deficient or anemic groups for band 4.1 data.
   Conclusion: Although in a previous in vivo study indicated that MDA inactivated the enzyme, and the amount of inactivation increased with MDA concentration, we found statistically no correlation between MDA and any other parameters:. This may be due to the prior removal of oxidatively injured cells from the circulation. Since cross-linking of membrane components may stiffen the RBC membrane, injured MDA-rich cells may be removed by splenic entrapment.

AB Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive regression and memory loss. It has been claimed that oxidative stress and factors such as metal accumulation in the brain play important roles in the etiopathogenesis of the disease.
   Material and methods: The subjects of this study consisted of 24 individuals with Alzheimer's disease and 15 healthy agematched controls. Blood samples were withdrawn from the patients and healthy controls, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes SOD (Superoxide Dismutase), GSH (Glutathion), GSHPx (Glutathion peroxidase), GST (Glutathion S-Transferase) and MDA (Malondialdehyde) levels were determined by Spectrometer. Some metals and heavy metals were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS).
   Results: Biochemical analyses showed a significant decrease of the main enzymatic antioxidant defences (SOD, GSH, GST and GSHPx) and increased production of lipid peroxidation marker (MDA) in the serum of AD patients, compared to age-matched control group (p< 0.001). Also the levels of Zn, Mg, and Mn was lower and Fe, Pb, and Cd was higher in the patient group, compared to the control group. Serum Cu and Co levels did not differ significantly between the patient and control groups (p> 0.001).
   Conclusion: These results supports the theory that in AD there is a defect in the antioxidant defense system, which may lead to oxidative damage. Also alterations in some trace metals and their related enzymes may play a role of etiopathogenesis in AD.

TI EPIDEMIOLOGY OF MEDIASTINAL TUMORS DURING SIX YEARS (2006-2012) IN RASHT
   CITY
SO ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA
LA English
DT Article
DE Prevalence; mediastinum; tumor
AB Introduction: Mediastinal masses are relatively uncommon and continue to be an interesting diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to thoracic surgeons. Although they tend to be more common in young and middle-aged adults, numerous types of mediastinal tumors and cysts affect people of all age groups. Epidemiologic survey of mediastinal tumors can get important information for physician and health experts. Materials and Methods: in this retrospective descriptive cross sectional study, documents of 109 patients with primary diagnosis of mediastinal tumor managed in the Razi Hospital between March 2006 and March 2012 were reviewed. 8 cases were excluded. Statistical analysis was done with SPSS (version 16).
   Results: This study was carried out on 101 patients, the mean age was 35.84 +/- 1.71 years and 56.4% of them were male. The most common mediastinal tumors were Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (30.7%), Thymoma (13.8%) and Hodgkin lymphoma (12.9%) respectively. 78.2% of tumors was in the anterior mediastinum. the most common symptoms were Cough and dyspnea; open biopsy was the most diagnostic method; CXR and CT scan were the most common imaging studies. There were seen significant differences between type of tumor and location of them (P<0.001). In addition, no significant differences were seen between different location of tumor and age (P=0.4) and gender (P=0.82).
   Conclusion: This study showed that mediastinal tumors were common in young male adults. Cough and dyspnea were the most common symptoms. In addition, lymphoma and Thymoma were the most common mediastinal tumors that were similar to previous studies.

AB Introduction: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by attacks of fever and serositis. Patients with FMF may use a lot of medications associated with the clinical symptoms. Drugs that are used in the treatment of FMF may cause bone loss. The aim of this study was to define mandibular bone mineral density (BMD) in adults with FMF using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) technique.
   Materials and methods: The study comprised 28 patients diagnosed with FMF (male/female: 16/12), and 32 healthy control subjects (male/female: 18/14) with no history of inflammatory disease. The BMD of each mandible was measured by DXA.
   Results: There was no statistically significant difference in gender, age or body mass index (BMI) between the FMF patients and the control group but mandibular BMD was significantly decreased in patients with FMF.
   Conclusion: However, it is difficult to draw any conclusions from the current cross-sectional study, FMF were found to be associated with decreased mandibular bone density.The results of the present study revealed that the mandibular BMD level was lower in FMF patients than in the control group.

AB Aim: The study was performed in order to develop the "Adaptation to Chronic Illness Scale (ACIS)" for the determination of the adaptation levels of individuals with chronic illnesss to their condition.
   Methods: The study was performed with a methodological design. Context, structural, criterion validity and internal consistency reliability and test-retest validity-reliability analysis were performed. The statistical meaningfulness level in all tests was determined as p<0.05.
   Results: As a result of context validity, factor analysis and item analysis, a 25 item scale with 3 sub components was obtained. In the scale, the variance amount explained by the three sub components was on a very good level (88.64%). The fact that all of the Cronbach alpha, Spearman-Brown and Guttman internal consistency coefficients of the scale and all of its sub components are above 0.70. When the test retest reliability coefficients of the whole scale and its sub components were examined, the scale was found to present consistent results in different applications and the scale was found to be reliable with regard to the constancy coefficient. The ACIS shows highly meaningful correlation with a scale of proven validity and reliability.
   Conclusion: The "Adaptation to Chronic Illness Scale (ACIS)", which was just added to literature, is a valid and reliable tool that can be used to evaluate adaptation to illness in individuals with chronic diseases.

AB Introduction: Lower extremity varicosity is an important health problem frequently seen in society that decreases the quality of life and can cause serious complications under certain circumstances. This study was aimed to determine the effect of pressured varicose vein stockings on sleep quality, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome symptoms, and symptoms of patients with varicose veins who were suggested for conservative treatment.
   Materials and methods: The study was designed according to a pretest posttest single study group pattern from experimental research methods. In gathering data for the study, a questionnaire on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, The Berlin Sleep Questionnaire, and the Sleep Quality Scale were used.
   Results: One month of varicose vein stocking use was seen to decrease Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) risk (p<0.05). When the sleep quality of patients for the last month was evaluated using the The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Scale (PSQS), a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of the first inventory application and the last inventory application was found (p<0.01), and statistically meaningful decreases in pain, cramps, edema, itching, weight feeling and leg fatigue perceptions were seen in patients (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: Regular varicose vein stocking use was found to increase sleep quality and improve OSAS symptoms. In addition, regular varicose vein stocking use was found to decrease symptoms of patients with varicose veins.

AB Introduction: To investigate the possible protective effect of lycopene on kidney after unilateral ureteral obstruction.
   Materials and methods: Twenty-one Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups in experimental study. In lycopene group, lycopene was administered two days before left ureteral ligation and was continued for 15 days. In control group, left ureteral ligation was applied with no medication. In sham group, midline incision was made to abdomen and then closed. Histopathological, biochemical and scintigraphic evaluations were made.
   Results: Microscopic score was 50.56 +/- 34.32 in lycopene, 97.22 +/- 39.14 in control and 28.33 +/- 12.58 in sham group. Microscopic score was lower in lycopene group than control group (p= 0.033). In biochemical analysis, mean value of myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrite levels were 0.05 +/- 0.03, 4.64 +/- 1.49 and 0.06 +/- 0.01 respectively in lycopene group, 0.10 +/- 0.03, 8.37 +/- 3.31 and 0.14 +/- 0.09 in control group and 0.04 +/- 0.01, 18.76 +/- 9.30 and 0.05 +/- 0.01 in sham group. MPO, MDA and nitrite levels were lower in lycopene group than in control group (p= 0.033, p= 0.007 and p < 0.001, respectively). Postoperative mean Technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-99m DMSA) uptake values of left kidneys were 6.26 +/- 5.17 in lycopene, 2.09 +/- 1.03 in control and 49.17 +/- 1.37 in sham group. There was no statistically significant difference between lycopene and control groups in respect of postoperative DMSA uptake values (p= 0.063).
   Conclusion: Lycopene is effective for the protection of kidney after ureteral obstruction as shown by microscopic parameters and decreased reactive oxygen species.

ID BRUCELLOSIS
AB Introduction: Pancytopenia develops due to vitamin deficiencies, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine diseases, and infections. We aimed to investigate the etiological causes of pancytopenia in one-year period.
   Materials and methods: In this retrospective study, etiological causes of pancytopenia were investigated in patients who were admitted to the hematology and internal diseases clinics of Ministry of Health Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital in 2012.
   Results: Of 251 patients with pancytopenia who were evaluated, 131 cases were male. The mean age was 58,73 +/- 17,70 years. Etiological causes of pancytopenia were categorized as four main groups, including hematological diseases in 94 patients (37.5%), hypersplenism in 72 patients (28.7%), vitamin B12 deficiency in 46 patients (18.3%), and other causes (autoimmune diseases, infections, etc.) in 39 patients (15.5%). The most common cause of pancytopenia was hypersplenism (n: 72, 28%), followed by vitamin B12 deficiency (n: 46, 18%), acute myeloid leukemia (n: 32, 12%), respectively.
   Conclusion: Hypersplenism is the most common cause of pancytopenia, even though cause of hypersplenism cannot be found out in half of all patients. Vitamin B 12 deficiency is a common cause that could be diagnosed with complete blood count and serum B 12 level, and be treated within a short time after a supplement or B12 injections, or a high-dose oral vitamin B12 treatment. HIV should be investigated in young patients. Hematological diseases and cancers are more observed in male patients older than sixty years.

DE Primary glomerular disease; proteinuria; renal biopsy
ID PROGNOSIS
AB Aim: Primary glomerular diseases (PGD) are seen frequently. Age, gender, geographical characteristics and genetic affect the distribution of the disease. Despite the treatment, a part of the disease may progress to end-stage renal disease. We evaluated the PGD patients and retrospectively regarding to their clinical and histopathological characteristics.
   Materials and methods: In this study PGD patients, who have had renal biopsy between 1st January 2009 and 31st December 2014 were evaluated. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, response of the treatment, biopsy evidences, and the risk factors associated with mortality were analyzed. We also compared the cases of primary glomerulonephritis retrospectively. The mean value of the follow-up periods was 22 months (range: 8 - 76 months).
   Results: The median age was 42 years (18 - 80) in 264 patients. When five groups were compared, there was statistically important difference between the groups (p < 0.001). The distributions of PGD subgroups were 40.5% for membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN), 20.4% for IgA nephropathy (IgAN), 25.7% for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), 7.9% for minimal change disease (MCD) and 5.3% for membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). The distrubition of gender was not significantly in the five PGD groups (p=0.269). Nephrotic syndrome was the most biopsy indication in MGN patients (76.6%). Nephritic syndrome was more seen in immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) patients (63%). Chronic kidney disease was more detected in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) patients as biopsy indication (p<0.001). Minimal change disease (MCD) and IgAN patients were more received with steroid treatment (85.7% and 55.5% respectively). Cyclophosphamide was more received in MGN patients. Serum IgG levels were more higher in FSGS and IgAN patients (p<0.001). Partial remission was more seen in MCD patients. Complete remission was more detected in MGN and FSGS patients. 29.1% of IgAN patients were not received treatment response. Six year renal survival rates were 84.1% (MGN), 87.1% (IgAN), 95.3% (MCD), 64.3% (MPGN) and 76.5% (FSGS) respectively.
   Conclusion: Biopsy maintains its diagnostic importance in glomerular diseases. Renal functions at diagnosis are important in response to treatment. Early diagnosis, follow-up and appropriate immunosuppressive medications affect mortality and clinical progress in PGD.

AB Insulin Autoimmune Syndrome (IAS) is a rare cause of hypoglycemia. We present the case of a 54-year-old male patient who was admitted to the emergency department with blurred consciousness approximately 6 weeks after the initiation of the methimazole therapy due to the diagnosis of Graves' disease. The blood glucose level was 40 mg/dL and levels of fasting insulin, C-peptide, and anti-insulin antibodies were increased. The patient was considered to have IAS and the methimazole therapy was terminated. Following the termination of the treatment, the complaints disappeared and the insulin antibodies gradually decreased to normal levels in approximately 8 months.

AB Introduction: Staphylococcus aureus is a well-recognized human pathogen that exists in clinical and community settings worldwide. Staphylococcus aureus can asymptomatically colonize the human and is known as responsible for a wide spectrum of illnesses. Many typing methods have been developed to perform subspecies differentiation needed in epidemiological studies. In this context, the aim of the present study was to compare sequence-based typing methods, such as Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and spa typing, in order to assess their discriminatory power and concordance.
   Materials and methods: 5290 S. aureus genomes were downloaded and used to determine MLST and spa types in silico. To estimate discriminatory power of typing methods and concordance between them the Simpson, adjusted Rand and adjusted Wallace indices have been calculated. GoeBURST and BURP algorithms were used for grouping MLST and spa types.
   Results: In 76.6% S. aureus genomes the spa and MLST types have been determined. Discriminatory power of spa typing was higher (89.4%) than MLST typing (80.5%). The overall agreement betwee spa typing and MLST at a type level was 39.2%. This have been proved with directional index of partition relation (adjusted Wallace) indicating no more 60% congruence.
   Conclusion: Concordance between spa and MLST typing data were no so high at a type level because of difference in their discriminatory power. At the same time, level of agreement between MLST and spa clonal complexes have reached 89.4%. Snp correction of MLST clonal complexes excluding MLST types with 3 and more bases distance from clonal complexes have led to 97.2% concordance. This high concordance was observed regardless of the place and time when Staphylococcus aureus was isolated.

AB Introduction: Currently, many different methods have been developed for subspecies typing of Staphylococcus aureus. However, there is no "ideal" one because of its disadvantages and thus there is no commonly accepted guidelines for the selection of the optimal typing method for epidemiological investigations. The aim of the study was an in silico comparison of widely used typing methods, including Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), Staphylococcus aureus Protein A (spa) typing, Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), Multiple Locus Variable-number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) and whole genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST), in terms of discriminatory power and coefficients congruence. Quantitative assessment of discriminatory power and correlation of five typing methods: wgMLST, PFGE, MLST, MLVA and spa typing was performed, by targeting the different sites of the Staphylococcus aureus genome (which had evolved at different rates).
   Materials and methods: 99 S. aureus whole genomes have been analyzed in silico to determine different (PFGE, spa, MLST, MLVA, wgMLST) subspecies types. Evaluation of the discriminatory power, strength and direction of the congruence of the typing methods was estimated by calculation of the Simpson's index, the adjusted Rand and the adjusted Wallace coefficients.
   Results: wgMLST was a method with the most discriminatory ability (Simpson's index was 0.992). PFGE and MLVA had the similar resolution power (0.989 and 0.983, respectively), followed by Spa (0.952) and MLST typing (0.919). At the type level, the best congruence of results were found for wgMLST and PFGE (78, 9%). Between spa and MLST types, the concordance was lower (51.2%). Otherwise, adjusted Rand index was below 0.5. On Clonal Complex (CC), Cluster or Group level, there was concordance 49.7% between wgMLST and PFGE. The moderate congruence were for MLVA CC6/8 and MLST CC (adj. Rand 0.857) and for MLVA CC7/8 and spa CC (adj. Rand 0.811).
   Conclusion: wgMLST as standardized typing method based on thousands loci (genes) with the highest discriminatory power have demonstrated great predictive ability for clonal complexes determined by sequence-based typing methods.

AB Introduction: According to our national health care system previous guidelines, lamivudine (LAM) or telbivudine treatment should be initiated in the naive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with low viral load. We aimed to investigate the success of LAM treatment in one year period.
   Materials and methods: We retrospectively recruited 125 naive CHB patients on LAM therapy. We recorded biopsy results, demographic, biochemical, serological and virological values at baseline and 3th, 6th and 12th months of treatment. Virological response was defined as undetectable hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA (<20 IU/mL).
   Results: Of patients, 81 were male (65%), and the mean age was 42 +/- 13. Mean histological activity index (HAI) was 4.55 +/- 2.16, and fibrosis was 2.65 +/- 0.90 in 114 patients who had biopsy results. The initial mean HBV DNA level was 5.52 x 106 IU/mL. Seroconversion was observed in only 3 (18.75%) of 16 HBeAg (+) patients. While baseline median ALT value was 36 U/L, following values were 28 U/L, 25 U/L and 24 U/L, respectively. HBV DNA significantly and gradually decreased with LAM treatment and it was finally determined to be negative in 80% of the patients in the 12th month.
   Conclusion: LAM treatment for naive CHB patients continues to be effective for the first 6th months, and if continued to be treated until 12th month, this efficiency can increase. However, it should be kept in mind that any patient with positive HBV DNA are under risk of HBV related complications.

ID LIVER-CIRRHOSIS
AB Introduction: Cirrhosis has various etiologies, and the etiologic distribution differs from center to center. Our aim is to reveal the etiological distribution and clinical features of cirrhotic patients.
   Materials and methods: We retrospectively recruited 1144 patients. Of patients, 480 were cirrhotic, 664 were non-cirrhotic. Patients were diagnosed by means of clinical features, laboratory values, radiologic imaging and biopsy when required.
   Results: Of the 480 cirrhotic patients, 250 were male (52%), and the mean age was 57.6 years. In cirrhotics, 289 (60.2%) patients were decompensated. However, hepatitis B virus (HBV) - hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection and Budd-Chiari syndrome were found to have highest tendency of decompensation (85.7%, 84.6% respectively). Child-Pugh classification was evaluated: 243 (50.6%) class A, 164 (34.2%) class B and73 (15.2%) class C patients were analyzed. Ascites in 206 (42.9%), hepatic encephalopathy in 55 (11.4%), hepatocellular carcinoma in 23 (4.7%), and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in 17 (3.5%) of the patients were determined. In the group of patients with viral etiology, while 160 (53.9%) of 297 cirrhotic patients were HCV, 137 (46.1%) were HBV, 503 (75.8%) out of 664 non-cirrhotics were HBV and 161 (24.2%) were HCV infected.
   Conclusion: Although HBV was more common in chronic hepatitides, cirrhosis was mostly caused by HCV infection. The reason of this may be due to anti-viral use for HBV. We found that decompensation rate was higher for Budd-Chiari syndrome and HBV-HCV coinfected patients. Cryptogenic cirrhosis still continues to have high prevalence. The reason for this may be undiagnosed autoimmune liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, occult HBV or gluten enteropathy.

AB Introduction: It was aimed to evaluate sleep disturbances and quality of life in primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) patients and to evaluate any relationship with urinary incontinence.
   Methods: The study included 77 voluntary patients admitted to the rheumatology clinic. The control group consisted of 80 healthy individuals. All participants were requested to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepines Scale (ESS), International Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) study group (IRLSSG) rating scale, and SF-36 quality of life questionnaire. The age of pSS onset, age at diagnosis, and age at the beginning of therapy were recorded. Patients with urinary incontinence were evaluated with the incontinence severity index(ISI).
   Results: The mean scores of the mental health, general health, vitality, physical function, physical role function and emotional role function parameters of the patients were statistically significantly lower than those of healthy volunteers. In the ESS scale, the average score was found to be 7.9 +/- 2.8 in the patient group and 4.5 +/- 2.1 in the control group. The average IRLSSG rating scale score was 13.4 +/- 7.6 in the patient group and 5.4 +/- 5.2 in the control group. The total PSQI score was 7.8 +/- 3.5 in the patient group and 4.11 +/- 1.64 in the control group. There was a statistically significant difference in terms of ESS, IRLSSG rating scale and sleep quality scores. Patients with urinary incontinence (n=26) had significantly higher PSQI and SF-36 scores than patients without urinary incontinence (n=51).
   Conclusion: Patients diagnosed with pSS have a significantly decreased sleep quality and HRQOL compared with the normal population. Urinary incontinence had a negative impact on sleep and HRQOL. RLS, sleepiness and urinary incontinence are common in patients with pSS.

AB Child abuse is the effect of multiple factors which create irreparable problems for suffering children and adolescents. Any failure, neglect or committing any action that endangers the child's physical and mental health is considered to be child abuse. The overall objective of this study is comparison of mental health in people with and without experience of child abuse. This was a causal-comparative study. The study population included all 13-15 year old students of second and third levels of middle school in districts 6, 8 and 9 of Tehran in 2014-2015 academic year. Members of the sample group were 215 students who were selected through convenience sampling using sample volume determination method to estimate the relationship and the formula for finite population correction. Child Abuse Self-Report Scale (CASRS) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) were used to collect information. The data were analyzed by SPSS software. Descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation and inferential statistics multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were used to analyze the data. Findings showed that mental health is lower in physically abused people compared to those who have not been physically abused. Also the mental health of people who were sexually abused was lower compared to those without this experience. Mental health of people who experienced emotional child abuse was lower compared to those without this experience. Somatic symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbances, and symptoms of depression are higher in people with experience of negligence child abuse compared to those without this experience. According to the findings and the high prevalence of child abuse and its effects on children's mental health, continuation of these harassments will lead to long-term psychological consequences for children and adolescents.

AB Introduction: Anopheles fluviatilis is one of the most important malaria vector in Iran. The aim of this study was to identify Anopheles fluviatilis complex species using proliferation and sequence analysis of ITS2 and also 28. S-D3parts of rDNA gene in southwestern Iran.
   Method: In this research Anopheles fluviatilis was caught from different areas of Kohgiluye and Boyer-Ahmad province at southwestern Iran at 1392. DNA was taken from 4 Anopheles fluviatilis selected samples and PCR tests of 28S-D3 part was done on sample's DNA and then after sequence of obtained results were identified and were compared with similar samples of Anopheles fluviatilis based on data's of gene word bank. Phylogenetic tree and individual sequences of samples were calculated.
   Results: PCR Phylogenetic analysis of r DNA 28S-D3 part of Anopheles fluviatilis confirmed that U genotype in Kohgiluye and Boyer-Ahmad province was identified. Gene length of r DNA 28S-D3 part between populations of this species was same (333bp).
   Conclusion: This study showed that Anopheles fluviatilis has species separate branch in southwestern Iran which is different with branch of southeastern Iran (Hormozgan, Kerman and Sistaan & Baluchestaan provinces).

AB Introduction: Because of the decrease in the success of standard triple treatment in Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication, new treatment modalities has been developed. But it is not known which of them is the most suitable regimen. We aimed to compare eradication rates of different eradication protocols.
   Materials and methods: 273 patients with dyspeptic complaints and naive Helicobacter pylori infection were randomized into three groups: 71 patients received quadruple therapy (QT) (proton pump inhibitor bid, bismuth salts 2x2, metronidazole 500 mg tid and tetracycline 500 mg qid, applied simultaneously for 14 days), 127 patients received concomitant therapy (CT) (proton pump inhibitor bid, amoxicillin 1000 mg bid, clarithromycin 500 mg bid and metronidazole 500 mg tid applied for 10 day) or 75 patients received levofloxacin containing sequential therapy (LST) (amoxicillin 1000 mg bid and proton pump inhibitor bid for first 5 days, following this proton pump inhibitor bid, levofloxacin 500 mg/day, metronidazole tid for remaining 5 days).
   Results: There were no significant differences in eradication rates between three treatment groups in the intention to treat analysis [QT: 64,8% (53,6-76,0%); CT: 77,2% (70,0-84,4%); LST: 70,7% (65,4-81,1%), P >0.05] and per protocol analysis [QT: 66,7% (55,7%-77,9%) CT: 77,8% (70,5-85,1%), LST: 72,6%,(62,4-82,8%), P >0.05].
   Conclusion: None of these three regimens were suitable for the consistent achievement of grade A results. It is still a challenge to define how eradication protocols can be improved in regions with high antibiotic resistance.

AB Introduction: In the scientific literature, a number of studies have reported conflicting results regarding the effects of occlusal vertical dimension (OVD) on sports-related skills. The purpose of this study was to increase OVD in sports subjects so as to specifically investigate the influence on cervical spine mobility. In particular, we measured cervical range of motion (ROM) before and after increasing OVD in individuals, either with or without malocclusion, analyzing both sports and sedentary subjects.
   Materials and methods: Participants were divided into two groups: a sports group (SG) and a control group (CG), each including 18 subjects. The SG was composed of sports subjects (age: 20.11 +/- 3.45 yrs; BMI: 25.39 +/- 2.32 kg/m(2)), whereas the CG consisted of age-matched sedentary subjects (age: 25.78 +/- 2.26 yrs; BMI: 24.88 +/- 2.87 kg/m(2)). Cervical range of motion (ROM) was evaluated, by way of an accelerometer (Moover r, Sensor Medica r), before (pre-test) and after (post-test) increasing OVD.
   Results: The main finding of this study was that sports subjects showed no significant difference, compared to control subjects, in cervical ROM in response to increased OVD. Moreover, we found that sports and sedentary subjects alike showed no significant change in cervical spine mobility as a result of increased OVD, regardless of whether they were affected by malocclusion (class II) or represented subjects with normocclusion (class I).
   Conclusion: In accord with several studies reported in the literature, the findings of our study indicate that occlusal splints failed to significantly improve the physical-performance endpoint measured, i. e. cervical ROM, in sports subjects as compared to sedentary individuals. Due to the paucity of studies, characterized by conflicting results, there is as yet no compelling scientific evidence as to whether OVD positively impacts sports performance or not. Accordingly, we suggest that further scientific investigation, regarding the relationship between sports performance and OVD, be conducted in the field of sport and exercise sciences.

AB Background: Gastric adenocarcinoma is the second commonest cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Improving this, will depend on earlier diagnosis and treatment. Recently it has been reported that inflammatory markers, particularly the neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet 1 lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and to a lesser extent the mean platelet volume (MPV), may be useful in the early diagnosis and prognostication of various malignancies. Objective: To investigate whether the NLR, PLR and MPV may be useful markers for the early diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma.
   Materials and methods: We retrospectively studied a group of 36 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, comparing them to healthy age and sex matched controls. Full blood counts were used to obtain various hematological indices, including the MPVs and to calculate the NLRs and the PLRs. Unpaired t-tests were used to determine if these differed between patients and controls.
   Results: Hemoglobin concentrations and lymphocyte counts were both significantly lower in patients compared to controls (P < 0.001). Neutrophil counts, NLRs, and PLRs were significantly higher in patients than in controls (P = 0.012, <0.001, and <0.001, respectively). MPVs did not differ significantly between patients and controls (P = 0.320)
   Conclusions: Both NLRs and PLRs may be usefid markers for the early diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma. They are almost universally available and easily obtained.

AB Tuberculosis is a contagious disease, this disease in third world countries of health problems. Isoniazid is an antituberculosis agent, which is now widely used together with other anti tuberculostatic agents for chemotherapy of tuberculosis. In this study, the investigations were performed by using cyclic voltammetry method on modified glassy carbon electrode with ionic liquid 1-Hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) amide [Hmim] [NTF2] and the thickness of gel on surface of electrode was optimized by anodic peak current. Also another effective factor such as pH effect, continuous scans effect and scan rate effect was studied. The results show that carbon ionic liquid electrode (CILE) reduces the overpotential of INZ oxidation, without showing any fouling effect due to the deposition of their oxidized products, In the case of INZ, the oxidation peak potentials appear at 1022 mV (vs Ag/AgCl, KCl, 3.0M), respectively, and the carbon ionic liquid electrode (CILE) shows a significantly better reversibility for isoniazid. Differential pulse voltammetry was used for the determination INZ. Relative standard deviation for INZ was less than 3%.

ID EMERGENCE; STRAIN
AB Introduction: Italy has a high incidence of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing carbapenemase (CRKP) infections. We report and discuss the experience of our Centre, an Internal Medicine Unit in North-Western Italy, focusing on the high clinical challenge dealing with this infections in year 2012 with data expanded over three years of surveillance
   Materials and methods: we retrospectively analyzed data of patients with isolation of CRKP during years 2011-2013.
   Results: In 2011 2 patients had positive cultures for CRKP; in 2012 CRKP was isolated in 21 patients. The mean age of the cohort was 77,6 (range 52-89). Cultures were positive in different specimens: urines 71,4%, blood 9.52%, upper respiratory tract 9.52%, wounds 9,52%. Most relevant infection-associated risk factors were identified in presence of devices such as urinary catheter (UC) (76% of patients) or central venous catheter (CVC) (47% of patients). In 2013 we observed 6 cases. Cultures were positive on urines, blood and abdominal drainage, blood, sputum and bronchial-alveolar lavage. In conclusion, in three years of surveillance we observed 29 patients with CRKP isolation: 17 urinary tract infections (response 6/13), 4 blood stream infections (response 1/3), 4 respiratory tract infections (response 1/3), 4 skin and soft tissue infections/colonization (not treated); crude mortality was 51% and global response to therapy was 42,1% on 19 treated patients.
   Conclusions: the 2012 outbreak was contained and the major awareness of the problem produced systematic new measures for infection control: screening with rectal swab for CRKP for patients admitted from other Hospitals or wards, sudden isolation of colonizedlinfected patients, more accurate attention to environmental and personal hygiene. CRPK is an important cause of morbidity and mortality; efficiency of single agent antibiotic therapy against CRPK seems to be not satisfying. Dedicated guidelines of new combination therapy are required.

AB Introduction: Clinical, laboratory and radiological findings in cases of tuberculous vertebral osteomyelitis (TVO), brucella vertebral osteomyelitis (BVO) and pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis (PVO) were compared and data with a significant impact on differential diagnosis were evaluated.
   Materials and methods: A total of 85 patients, 45 TVO, 26 BVO and 14 PVO, treated and followed-up in a university hospital during 7 years were evaluated retrospectively.
   Results: The most common symptom in all groups was lumbar pain. Statistically significant differences were found between the groups in terms of symptoms of fever and sweating in BVO patients, back pain in TVO patients. Staphylococcus aureus is the most frequent causative microorganism in PVO patients. Lumbar involvement was predominant in all three groups of patients in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings.
   Conclusion: Back pain, vertebral tenderness and motor loss in lower extremity, increase in procalcitonin and positive tuberculin skin test should be considered in cases with a diagnosis of TVO. Fever, sweating, consumption of unpasteurized milk and dairy products, residing in rural regions and contact with animals, positive Wright test should be considered in cases with a diagnosis of BVO. History of surgical operation, short duration of admitting symptoms should be considered in cases with a diagnosis of PVO.

AB Introduction: Hypothyroidism is a common disease in the society. Based on the effects of vitamin D on immune system and endocrine system, the relationship between hypothyroidism and vitamin D gained importance. The relationship between vitamin D deficiency and thyroid was suggested for the first time by Kivity and his colleagues. In their study, they found a significant relationship between thyroid autoantibodies and vitamin D levels. In this study we want to show the relationship between autoimmunity and vitamin D deficiency in female patients with hypothyroidism.
   Materials and methods: This study was performed at the GOP Taksim Education and Research Hospital outpatient department of internal medicine between January and June in 2015. It included 80 females patients, and 18 control females subjects
   Results: A total of 98 participants were included in this study. The mean durations of hypothyroidism are 5,86 +/- 5,91 vs. 5,43 +/- 5,62 years. Anti-thyroid autoantibodies (Anti TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (anti TG) levels were significantly higher in the group 1 patients compared to the group 2 patients and control subjects (p<0,01). There were no significant differences at other variables between the patients and control subjects. The serum 25-OH vitamin D levels were significantly lower in the Hashimoto thyroiditis and Non-Hashimoto thyroiditis patients compared to the healthy controls (10,88 +/- 9,19 ng/ml vs. 10,53 +/- 6,87 ng/ml, p<0.01).
   Conclusion: It was thought that the study's being conducted during the winter months might have affected vitamin D levels. The vitamin D value of the control group cases was found to be higher as compared to the case of hypothyroidism associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and of hypothyroidism associated with other reasons. No significant difference was observed in vitamin D levels between the groups of hypothyroidism associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and hypothyroidism associated with other reasons

AB Introduction: In 1907 Louisa Burns took into account the pregnant woman as a target of choice for Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) and over the years various studies have shown the efficacy of OMT and identified fields of application for the problems that may be encountered by pregnant women. Firstly Osteopathy in Italy is not recognized today, despite it being recognized as a profession, it is not considered a medical practice and thus cannot be taught in university faculties of medicine and surgery and the professional figure of an osteopath cannot take part of the hospital staff. This study aims to examine the state of knowledge of the osteopathic profession in the population of pregnant women in relation to the level of study.
   Materials and methods: The study was performed at the 2nd Family Counseling - Modica Alta USL No. 7 - Ragusa, the counseling Family (ex CT3) - Via G. D'Annunzio 60 - Catania and the hospital of Lentini - District hospital SR2. 288 pregnant women aged between 15 and 42 participated in the research. The gestational average period is 7 months. To Pregnant women was asked to fill out a self-reported, for evaluate their knowledge of the osteopathy
   Results: The results obtained show that there is a knowledge default of osteopathy as alternative medicine and the benefits that you could have from a manual processing.
   Conclusion: Complementary and Alternative therapies in Medicine should be considered as treatment options for to ensure a physiological development of the body of woman nine months of pregnancy is continually changing. For this aim, we suggest to encourage projects in osteopathy during pregnancies in family counseling using childbirth courses to inform medical, obstetrician and nurse staff and women. We hope for a successful collaboration among the professional figures that with their passion are dedicated to the prevention and care of the pregnant woman.

AB Introduction: Stroke represents a frequent occurrence among the elderly and one of the top causes for disability. The complexity of stroke injury requires a multi factorial approach for improved neurological recovery and increased autonomy.
   Material and methods: We conducted a longitudinal study on 115 inpatients with a first unilateral stroke and no severe cognitive impairment. Through group randomization, patients were exposed to one of the three following treatment modalities: neuroprotective multimodal pharmacological therapy (NT), physical therapy (PT) and a combination of the above (NT+KT). Reisberg Global Deterioration Scale(RGDS), Tinetti Balance Assessment Tool(TBAT)(Romanian version), and Barthel Index of Daily Activities of Living (BIDAL) were used to assess dimensions of post-stroke functionality. Scores were recorded at baseline (T0) and at one month (T1).
   Results: RGDS scores showed a marginally significant improvement as a function of time by treatment (p< 0.057, partial eta 2= 0.05). TBAT scores differed significantly based on time by treatment [F(2,112)= 4,82, p< 0.05, partial eta 2= 0.08]. No significant time by treatment differences were found on BIDAL scores. Treatment modality did significantly impact score changes among patients over 70 years (p< 0.01, partial eta 2= 0.11) on RGDS and TBAT, with the most favorable score changes for the NT + KT treatment group.
   Conclusions: Age might influence the evolution of recovery. Patients over 70 years benefit the most from the combined therapy. This treatment approach confers a supplementary benefit by supporting brain plasticity and reducing physical disabilities.

AB Background and objectives: Heart rate recovery at first (HRR-I) and second (HRR-II) minute after exercise is accurate in estimating autonomic nervous system balance, and has been related to risk of cardiovascular events. Our aim was to determine independent predictors of HRR collected during standard cardio-pulmonary stress test (CPT) in a group of overweight/obese subjects without (N = 14) and with type 2 diabetes (N = 19), as compared to a sample (N = 15) of healthy sedentary subjects.
   Methods: A graded exercise test on treadmill was performed. Oxygen uptake at rest and at peak exercise (VO(2)max), as well as respiratory exchange ratio at peak exercise was collected. Linear and logistic regression was used to assess association between variables collected at CPT and HRR-I and HRR-II.
   Results: Age, gender, as well as VO2 and HR at rest were all comparable among groups. VO(2)max and HRmax were both lower in diabetic patients as compared to healthy and overweight/obese groups (20 +/- 4.3 vs. 28 +/- 7 vs. 25.1 +/- 5 ml/Kg/min respectively, p < 0.01). VO(2)max had the highest association to HRR-I (R2=0.47) and HRR-II (R2=0.44); VO(2)max < 28 and VO(2)max < 29 were the most accurate cut-off values to identify subjects with abnormally low HRR-I and HRR-II.
   Conclusions: VO(2)max is an independent predictor of HRR-I or HRR-II, and it is able to discriminate between patients with normal or abnormally low HRR values. Further studies are warranted to test usefulness of a customized exercise program to ameliorate autonomic nervous system balance, therefore reducing global cardiovascular risk.

TI ROLE OF CANNABINOIDS IN THE TREATMENT OF TINNITUS

   ACTIVITY
AB Tinnitus is a frequent symptom in audiological clinical practice characterized by an abnormal noise perceived in one or both ears or in the head, in which a patient has a conscious hearing percept in absence of external sound. Tinnitus might be caused by a homeostatic response of central dorsal cochlear nucleus auditory neurons that makes them hyperactive in compensation to auditory input loss. One hypothesis suggests that tinnitus is a sensory form of epilepsy that involves the cochlear nucleus and the inferior colliculus, which display impairment in the electrical activity in the auditory system. This alteration determines a synaptic plasticity in the dorsal cochlear nucleus that becomes a target for pharmacological compounds able to treat tinnitus. There is no effective drug treatment for tinnitus, but different studies propose the use of cannabinoid receptors agonist for their anti-epileptic activity, although their practical effects are still unclear. In this review, we want to analyze the emerging pharmacological approaches of cannabinoid receptor agonists to the therapy of tinnitus.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study is analysing that the compliance of patient positive airway pressure treatment through nasal mask and if necessary positive airway pressure compliance of patient to positive airway pressure treatment after surgical treatment in the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome patients.
   Materials and methods: In The Sleep Disorder Laboratory of Ataturk Pulmonary Diseases and Thoracic Surgery Hospital obstructive sleep apnea syndrome diagnosis patients, who are planed by nasal continuous positive airway pressure treatment are viewed for their nasal continuous positive airway pressure tolerances and these patients were signed up as work and control groups. By randomizing these group were refered to The Otolaryngology of Kecioren Training and Research Hospital. The patients checked ear-nose-throat examination are reviewed without awaring of which one is work group or control group.
   Result: As a result of our research among the patients groups are able to tolerate or not able to tolerate to the nasal continuous positive airway pressure device and in apnea hypopnea index supine and collapse of soft palate anterioposterior significant statistical differences were observed. (p< 0,05) From the point of septal deviation, inferior concha hypertrophy significant statistical differences were not found.
   Conclusions: In spite of the fact that the nasal pathologies are considered to influence the compliance, there is no effect to the tolerance. The tolerance of patients, even if the tongue base is not huge, can be connected with the collapse in the tongue base and soft palate level. When the patients not able to tolerated are reviewed, the collapse in the tongue base and soft palate level are evaluated carefully.

AB Introduction: There is still uncertainty about the pathophysiological role of magnesium (Mg) in the course of acute coronary syndrome. Since Mg is considered to be natural physiologic 'calcium (Ca) antagonist', the balance between Ca and Mg seems to be more important to reflect its homoeostasis rather than the measurement of serum Mg level.
   Material and methods: A total of 92 patients (67 male, mean age 61.19 +/- 13.64 years) with the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome were enrolled into this study. Patients were divided into 2 groups by non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. Clinical and demographic characteristics, and the results of blood samples within 24 hour of admission were evaluated.
   Results: The mean Ca/Mg ratio for the entire subject cohort on admission was 4.28 +/- 0.53. Although serum Ca level was not statistically significantly different between two groups, the patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were found to have significantly low levels of serum Mg as compared to the non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction group (p = 0.004). Consistently, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was associated with higher Ca/Mg ratio as compared those with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. In multivariate linear regression analysis, acute coronary syndrome presentation (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) (Unstandardized Coefficients B = 0.262; 95%CI=0.048 - 0.476; p=0.017) and serum triglyceride (Unstandardized Coefficients B = -0.002; 95%CI=-0.001 -0.000; p=0.027) were found as independent predictors of serum Ca/Mg ratio.
   Conclusion: The serum Ca/Mg ratio is higher in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients compared those with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. This could be because of a greater decrease in the levels of Mg than in those of Ca.

AB Objective: To investigate efficacy and safety of treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease with esomeprazole combined with itopride.
   Method: 72 cases of gastroesophageal reflux disease patients that met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into two groups, with 40 cases in treatment group and 32 cases in control group. There was no significant difference in age and sex of the two groups (P> 0.05). The treatment group was treated with esomeprazole + itopride, while the control group was treated with esomeprazole + domperidone. Course of treatment ran 4 weeks. The clinical efficacy and safety were observed.
   Result: Clinical remission rate and recurrence rate of treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease with esomeprazole combined with itopride are superior to the control group, and itopride brought no significant adverse reactions.
   Conclusion: Esomeprazole combined with itopride is an ideal drug for treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease, safe and reliable and with less adverse reactions.

AB The authors studied functional stress in subjects video display terminal (VDT) with alterations of the ocular surface. 40 subjects were admitted to the study video display terminal (VDT) (14 males and 26 females, mean age 67+/-5 yr) with signs and symptoms of discomfort and/or dry eye (burning, foreign body sensation, dryness and itching), with Schirmer I less than 10 mm, with Break-up time Test (B. U. T.) lower at 8 seconds according to the Van Bijsterveld 1 criteria. A test "of perceived stress measurement" (MSP) was performed on all patients to assess the self-perceived stress aspects, "feeling stressed" derived from a widely held tool in the international arena, the Mesuredu Stress Psychologique(MSP). 40 healthy patients, workers, non-VDU operators as controls were also enrolled.
   The analysis of individual cluster showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups with regards to only the cluster 1 and 2 (p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively). The correlation analysis showed that there is a positive correlation between the MSP and the number of shifts. Multivariate analysis that place as out as the main the presence or absence of clinically significant stress, found that, controlling for age and sex, the number of shifts and the presence of positive Schirmer test are two risk factors for the development of stress.
   An alteration of the ocular surface in (VDT) can easily trigger the chronic process of stress in the terminal operators video subjects with higher exposure to at least 2 hours with changes effectively bacterial microbiota of the ocular surface.

AB The tear film consists of a set of heterogeneous substances (lipids, proteins, mucin and water) combined in order to form a highly organic tropism structure specialized in the defense of the ocular surface. Dry Eye Disease (DED) is characterized by discomfort, visual disturbance, constant irritation, foreign body sensation, and blurred vision. We evaluate in this preliminary report the effect of supplementation with symbiotic Maxiflor on tear film in DED patients. We recruited 40 patients (27 females and 13 males, age 51.5 +/- 11. 1) showing signs of discomfort and / or dry eyes (burning, foreign body sensation, dryness or itching). Following the run-in period subjects were randomized in two groups: group A (N degrees 20 subjects) and group B (N degrees 20 subjects). Group A (control) treated only with substitute tear and group B treated with substitute tear + mixture (symbiotic). The data obtained in the two study groups A and B were, respectively the following: Schirmer 10.1 +/- 0.2 vs 12.7 +/- 0.4 (p < 0.001); Schirmer II 3.6 +/- 0.1 VS 4.6 +/- 0.2 (p<0.001); Fluorescein in break-up time (TF BUT) 4.1 +/- 0.3 vs 6.5 +/- 0.2 (p<0.001). Culture test showed initial bacterial growth in 18 out of 40 samples tested in group "A" (control), corresponding to 45.0%; whereas bacterial culture was found positive after treatment in 14 out of 40 tests, equal to 35.0%, in group "B" (symbiotic). A reduction of 16 to 12 strains of aerobic and anaerobic isolates from 10 to 6 has been found. The present study shows that the administration of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus may represent a successful treatment in ameliorating DED.

AB Introduction: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) also known as extrinsic allergic alveolitis is a chronic, immunologically mediated inflammatory disorder that is caused by the diffuse and repeated inhalation of antigens, such as organic particles of animal or herbal origin and certain chemical compounds. Agents capable of inducing HP are found in a variety of settings including the home, workplace and in recreational activities. Drug options for the treatment of chronic HP are limited.
   Case presentation: The present study reports the case of a patient who was diagnosed with chronic HP when working as a cook. The patient was treated with azathioprine after experiencing severe side effects of methylprednisolone therapy.
   Conclusion: Corticosteroids are the most commonly recommended treatment. However, severe side effects of prolonged steroid therapy are an important limitation. In chronic HP, azathioprine therapy is effective in cases who are unresponsive to or have serious adverse effects with steroid therapy.

ID CECAL LIPOMA; DIAGNOSIS; RESECTION; FEATURES; STRATEGY; REMOVAL
AB Introduction: Lipomas are the second most common benign tumors of the colon after adenomatous polyps. Their incidence is less than 1% in general population. They are generally located in the submucosa and their distribution tends to favor the right colon. Most cases are asymptomatic and do not require any special treatment. Lipomas larger than 2 cm tend to be symptomatic and are mistaken for cancer.
   Clinical series: Sixteen patients of colonic submucosal lipomas operated between 2000 and 2013 were analyzed as regards of age, gender, clinical symptoms, tumor localization, diagnostic tools, size of tumor, complications and treatment modalities.
   Six patients were women. The mean age was 51 years (range 35-86). The size of the tumors were measured between 0.8-6 cm. Four patients required urgent abdominal exploration and twelve patients underwent elective surgery with the diagnosis of colonic tumoral lesion. The reason for urgent exploration was colonic obstruction as a result of intussusception caused by colonic lipomas. In two patients, colonic lipomas were diagnosed coincidentally with a colonic carcinoma and a colonic diverticulosis. Surgical pathologic examination confirmed colonic lipomas in all cases. There was no mortality. During postoperative follow-up period, the patients were free of symptoms and there was no recurrence.
   Conclusion: Colonic lipoma although rare, should be kept in mind while evaluating the adult patient with colonic submucosal tumor or with colonic intussusceptions to avoid unnecessary wide resections.

AB Introduction: Chronic subclinical volume overload, frequently observed in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, is associated with increased arterial stiffness (AS), diastolic heart failure (HF), and higher mortality and morbidity. Diastolic HF is also known as HF with preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF). We here in evaluated the effect of volume status on development of arterial stiffness and diastolic HF in patients with normal or near-normal LV systolic function.
   Materials and methods: A total of 75 chronic patients with PD and 52 age- and gender-matched control subjects were included in this study. Fluid overload (FO) was determined using multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (mBIA). LVEF, peak velocity of atrial filling (E/A ratio), left atrium diameter (LAD), LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), and LV end-systolic diameter (LVESD) were obtained using echocardiography (ECHO). Brachial-ankle artery pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and augmentation index (AIx) were measured to determine AS.
   Results: Of a total 75 patients, 56 (59.6%) were undergoing continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD). The mean values for systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure (PP) were 130 +/- 24, 80 +/- 17, 103 +/- 19, and 50 +/- 16 mmHg, respectively. The mean SBP, LAD, and LV mass index (LVMI)(all p < 0.005) were higher and the E/A ratio (p = 0,000) was lower in patients with PD than in healthy controls. Comparison of hypervolemic and normovolemic patients showed that the mean SBP, LAD, LVEDD, LVESD, and LVMI (all p < 0.005) were significantly higher and the mean LVEF (p = 0.003) was significantly lower in the hypervolemic group, whereas the mean DBP, MAP, baPWV, PP, and AIx were not significantly different between the two groups (all p > 0.005). Multivariate regression analysis adjusted for ECHO parameters revealed that age (beta = 0.733, p = 0.001), diabetes status (beta = 0.184, p = 0.027), and SBP (beta = 0519, p = 0.001) were independently associated with increased baPWV.
   Conclusions: Overhydration (OH) was higher in patients with PD than in healthy controls and was associated with development of diastolic HF in patients with PD. Additionally, age, SBP, and diabetes status and not FO were independent predictors of baPWV in patients with PD.

AB Introduction: Technological advancements have been such that today the indwelling vocal prostheses, in laryngectomyzed patients, are designed to meet the criteria of low airflow resistance, optimal retention in the tracheoesophageal party wall, prolonged device lifetime, simple maintenance by patient and comfortable outpatient replacement. The aim of this study was to assess the initial clinical experience using third generation of vocal prosthesis (Provox Vega).
   Materials and method: A retrospective study was carried out with 54 laryngectomized patients during the period 2011-2015. Patients were rehabilitated with indwelling Provox Vega 17 and 20 Fr. Fourteen patients were considered normal patients (Group A); thirteen patients received postoperative radiotherapy (Group B); sixteen patients were categorized as GERD patients (Group C) and eleven subject as elderly patients (Group D).
   Results: The mean in situ Vega lifetime was 193 days (range: 144-243) in group A, 168 days: (range 125-182) in group B, 123 days (range: 97-134) in group C and 240 days in group D (range: 205-328). Overall, the prosthetic lifetime average was 187.5 days. The Harrison-Robillard-Schultz score, did not show statistically significant differences with the reference groups.
   Conclusion: The study in question showed an overall better results in terms of lifetime and use, quality and care of the rehabilitation level, but nonetheless comparable with those present in the literature and previously registered, in terms of statistical significance.

DT Article
DE Holt-Oram; Atrial Septal Defect; Surgery
ID MUTATIONS; DISEASE; LIMB
AB Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS) is a heart-upper limb malformation complex with an autosomal dominant inheritance and near-complete penetrance but variable expression. Holt and Oram first described this syndrome in 1960. Approximately 40% of cases represent new mutations. The syndrome is associated with defective development of cardiac structures that results in atrial septal defect (ASD), most commonly the secundum type; heart block of varying degree; or both.
   The syndrome is characterized by cardiac malformations and aplasia or hypoplasia of the thumb. The incidence of HOS is estimated at 1: 100,000 live births. In the literature, it is also known as atriodigital syndrome, heart-hand syndrome, upper limb-cardiovascular syndrome, cardiac-limb syndrome, or cardiomelic syndrome. Herein, we report a 22-year-old female case of HOS presenting with the absence of the right radius of the upper limb and ulnar dysplasia, hypoplasia, and kyphoscoliosis along with a large secundum type ASD and carotid artery abnormalities. We present this case of holt-oram syndrome with cardiac surgery and postoperative neurological complication and its successful treatment.

AB Introduction: Most of the time hyperammonemia is seen in hepatic encephalopathy, but it can coexist with various other conditions. In this study, we investigated the causes of hyperammonemia in noncirrhotic patients with encephalopathy. The aims of this study were identifying risk groups of patients who can present with hyperammonemic metabolic encephalophaty.
   Materials and methods: This retrospective, observational, descriptive, sectional clinic study was conducted in a tertiary level training and research hospital between July 2013 and October 2015. Blood ammonia levels were analyzed in metabolic encephalopathy patients who have presented to the emergency department (ED).
   Results: Among 135 patients (54 patients had cirrhosis and 81 patients did not have cirrhosis) enrolled in this study Mean age was 57 years (range 18-88 years). 67 % of the patients were male (n= 90) and 33% of the patients were female (n= 45). In cirrhotic group although mean values of ammonia got higher as Child-Pugh class raised from A to C (164.2, 202 and 248 mu g/dl respectively) the difference was not statistically significant. In noncirrhotic group we found remarkable increased ammonia level in the patients with epilepsy or patients who have seizure (n: 37, ammonia level: 110,49 (18-687)), patients with urinary problems (n: 27, ammonia level: 135,88 (18-687)), patients with sepsis (n: 28, ammonia level: 133,09 (29-687)), and patients who have starvation or oral intake difficulty (n: 24, 133,7 (20,90-687))
   Conclusion: Blood ammonia levels are useful in differential diagnosis of adult patients who present to ED with new or acute mental status changes of unknown cause. Ammonia levels may be elevated in noncirrhotic patients. Urinary problems, epilepsy or seizure, starvation or oral intake difficulty can be the cause of hyperammonemia. In clinical practice when evalutating patients with hyperammonemia emergency physicians should be familiar with causes other than cirrhosis.

AB Introduction: During the last decades, a general amelioration of clinical outcomes has been reported because of the evolution of cardiac surgery techniques. However, infective complications as mediastinitis still represent a major problem in terms of morbidity and mortality in cardiac surgery, with severe suffering of the patient. Furthermore, the incidence of this complication has remained stable over the last three decades and this condition also determines a significant prolongation of hospitalization with an increase in costs. The procedures used for the treatment of mediastinitis have undergone deep modifications over the years but, in despite of these improvements, mortality has remained high. Over the last years, the negative pressure therapy (ie the Vacuum Assisted Closure-Therapy) is taking over all the other treatments.
   Materials and method: From January 2010 to December 2015, at University of Bari Cardiac Surgery Center have been performed 3123 median sternotomy for cardiac surgery. Deep sternal wound infection occurred in 35 patients (1.1207%). In all of these patients was performed vacuum therapy.
   Results: The duration of vacuum treatment was 14.4 +/- 6.7 days. Inflammatory indexes showed a marked decline. At the end of vacuum therapy, in some cases, the reconstruction of the wound was carried out with plastic reconstruction by means of a pectoral flap. No deaths for mediastinitis were recorded, neither any relapse or treatment-related complication. Hospital stay was 30.4 +/- 13.5 days from the beginning of treatment.
   Conclusion: The results obtained in our center with vacuum therapy are much more better than those obtained with classic procedures used in the past. Based on our experience and from analysis of literature, vacuum therapy should be the procedure of choice for the treatment of post-sternotomy mediastinitis. Furthermore, this approach has shown satisfactory results in terms of hospital stay time and costs.

AB Introduction: Neurodegenerative diseases are among significant agent of mortality in human societies. The major cause of this disease is the elimination of SMN1 gene exogenous 7 located on telomeric terminal of chromosome 5. The patients at least posses one copy of SMN2 gene which is located on centromeric terminal and is slightly different from the main gene.
   Methods: In the present study, TDP-43 gene was knocked down in Hela cell line, using siRNA technic and the expression level of mRNA was evaluated in SMN1 gene by semi-quantitative index method and using real-time PCR.
   Results: After statistical analyses the most important result was significant decrease in level of mRNA expression in SMN1 gene approximately by 6.14 fold. Sanger sequencing method was applied for exact evaluation of total TDP-43 gene length in the patients and carriers.
   Conclusion: In accordance with involvement of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and brain in ALS and SMA diseases in this survey, it is suggested that the mentioned gene mutation in SMA disease can be effective in regulation of the disease main gene expression.

AB Introduction: Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is a prion disease that has a wide range of clinical presentations. The diagnosis of CJD is a highly challenging issue, as clinical manifestations should be considered along with electroencephalography (EEG), cerebrospinal fluid examination (CSF), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and serum analysis.
   Cases presentation: we describe two cases of CJD, come to our observation in the same period. In first patient clinical features suggested the diagnosis of Heidenhain's dementia, a rare variant of sporadic CJD, occurring in a 71-year-old woman. She succumbed to the disease within 8 weeks of onset of symptoms and diagnosis was pathologically confirmed. Second patient, a 56-year-old housewife, referred with mood disorders and presenting dementia, ataxia, myoclonic jerks, carried point mutation V2101 at codon 210 of the Prion Protein (PRNP) gene. In both patients protein 14-3-3 in CSF was detected, EEG showed bilaterally periodic sharp and slow-wave discharges, and MRI findings revealed cortex hyper-intensity ("ribbon-sign") in DWI and T2W sequences.
   Conclusions: Our two cases are interesting because the beginning was atypical, namely with visual disturbance previous for several months the definite clinical picture in one case, and in the other with misleading psychiatric disorders.

AB Introduction: Gastric cancer continues to be one of the most common cancers in the world, even though its incidence has decreased in some countries. Despite developments in diagnosis and treatment techniques, the disease may progress after operation despite adjuvant treatment combinations((2)). Thus, early diagnosis is important. In this study, the role of the systemic immune response (SIR) was assessed by the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the thrombocyte/lymphocyte ratio (TLR) in relation to the diagnosis of gastric malignant-benign pathologies performed using upper gastrointestinal system endoscopy.
   Material and methods: In total, 1916 patients were included in this study, of whom 964 (50.3%) were male and 952 (49.7%) were female. All subject had undergone upper gastrointestinal system endoscopy in the Batman Regional State Hospital Endoscopy Unit between 2010 and 2012.
   Results: When SIR was evaluated with the NLR, it was positive in 1415 (73.9%) patients. When the patients were grouped based on their pathological diagnosis, there was no relationship between the pathological diagnosis and the SIR determined by the NLR (p=0.629). When SIR was evaluated with the TLR, it was positive in 1450 (75.7%) patients. When the patients were grouped based on their pathological diagnosis, there was no relationship between the pathological diagnosis and the SIR determined by the TLR (p=0.944). Endoscopy is a standard method for the differential diagnosis of gastric pathologies.
   Conclusion: We have demonstrated that NLR and TLR, which are indicators of the systemic inflammatory response, do not play a role in increasing the diagnostic strength of endoscopy. Additionally, we believe that easily accessible, cheap, and easy-to-use laboratory methods can be developed with further studies on this topic.

ID NURSE
AB Introduction: Although professional identity is a concept frequently used in nursing literature, its theoretical origin has remained unclear. On the other hand, investigating this concept is essential to the development of nursing as a profession. Therefore, it is necessary to understand and clarify professional identity and describe its attributes.
   Material and methods: The framework of this study is Roger's evolutionary method. After a systematic electronic search in MEDLINE, OVID, PROQUEST, and SCIENCE DIRECT databases, 57 articles on nursing and health sciences and 8 nursing theses were analyzed.
   Results: Five attributes were identified and professional identity was defined as an evolving process resulting from the integrity of education and experience, knowledge and caring, personal and professional identity, and values that is related to group interactions at workplace.
   Conclusion: Professional identity is a complex and multidimensional concept with gender, social, historical, cultural, political, and organizational considerations. The findings of this concept analysis could guide further researches on nursing professional identity.

AB Introduction: This study aims to assess whether female and male individuals have different parameters of metabolic syndrome when they are classified as being viscerally obese or non-obese.
   Material and methods: We enrolled 288 subjects (169 women, 119 men) who were admitted to Clinic of Internal Medicine, Ankara Education and Research Hospital. They underwent physical examinations and anthropometric evaluation. They also underwent ultrasonography and blood samples were collected for further investigation. After cut-off values for visceral fat were determined, female and male subjects were classified as they were viscerally obese or not obese and all their parameters were compared.
   Results: Female viscerally obese subjects had statistically higher values of blood glucose, blood pressure, insulin, cholesterol, triglyceride and homeostasis model assessment - insulin resistance index than female Who were not obese. Men with visceral obesity had higher values of blood pressure, insulin, triglyceride and homeostasis model assessment - insulin resistance index than men who were not obese.
   Conclusions: Visceral obesity was linked to high blood pressure, triglyceride, insulin resistance in all subjects, but high blood glucose, total cholesterol levels were elevated only in females. We think that visceral fat thickness measured by ultrasonography can estimate not only visceral obesity but also risks of cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome both in females and males.

DT Article
DE Depression; mean platelet volume; coronary artery disease; SSRI

AB Introduction: Patients with depression are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Mean platelet volume (MPV) provides a measurement of activated platelets; increasing platelet activation is one of the mechanisms that may link depression and ischemic cardiac disease.
   Material and method: 100 newly diagnosed patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 100 healthy controls admitted to our outpatient clinics. We started selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment in the MDD patients and followed them for 3 months. Patients' laboratory tests and physical, neurological, and psychiatric examinations were performed both at diagnosis and after 3 months of treatment.
   Results: The MDD group consisted of 90 people and the control group consisted of 88 people met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. There was no significant difference between the ages of the groups (p = 0.28). There were more males within the MDD group (55.6%). MPV was significantly greater in MDD group (p<0.001); MPV levels showed significantly decline after treatment with SSRIs (p<0.001). The platelet counts were also significantly low in MDD patients when compared with the control group, with the difference being statistically significant (p<0.001). No significant difference was observed in platelet counts after treatment. Severity of depression also declined after treatment. The average Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score decreased 9.23 points; the difference was statistically significant (p<0.001).
   Conclusion: We conclude that MPV can be an indicator of platelet activity in patients with MDD and SSRIs can be used along with MPV to help identifying and treating coronary artery disease in MDD patients. According to our findings, SSRIs may have an antiplatelet action in addition to their antidepressant effects, which may be beneficial for MDD patients with coronary artery disease.

AB The Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a neurological syndrome, which has seldom been associated with hearing dysfunction, particularly sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).
   The disease of Charcot-Marie-Tooth is due to the alteration of one or more geniuses that give way to the formation of the assone and the genesis of the myelin, whose synthetic deficit involves the reduction of the speed of nervous management.
   The aim of the study was to detect in individuals suffering from Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome with audiological signs and symptoms qualitative and quantitative type of hearing impairment and of these finds some assumptions on the location of the damage along the auditory nerve pathways.

AB Sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response to infection, is the most common cause of death in people hospitalized in intensive care units (ICU). Early diagnosis of infection is crucial to the appropriate management of sepsis, with early antibiotic administration consistently resulting in improved outcomes.
   The purpose of this study, although preliminary, was to determine whether vitamin D levels correlate with procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in 59 septic patients, with positive emocoltures.
   This study is also aimed to point out new possible diagnostic protocols identifying potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of sepsis, defined according to literature data.

AB To fully guarantee the health and safety of China's martial arts sportsman and provide medical service for those who have suffered sport injury, the injury features and basic causes were fully analyzed by taking common knee joint injury of martial sport as example,. Through questionnaire analyses and image analysis, 1200 martial arts sportsmen were brought into such clinical investigation, and the specific causes for their knee joint injuries were comprehensively analyzed. In addition, during the athletic rehabilitation period, the sports intensity and content were comprehensively adjusted. Results show that, high challenge training and common martial arts routine are of basic causes for knee joint injury of martial arts sportsman. Of all 1200 sportsmen, the injured ones account for 61% (73211200), moreover these injuries were significantly related to factors such as individual quality, age; years doing martial arts. In addition, by adjusting lite training content, the curative efficiency,was significantly improved and the curative effect was very significant. From such investigation we can conclude that knee joint inlay is the most common type of sport injury for martial arts sportsman, and the cause is relatively complex and can be subjective or objective. Therefore, to decrease the occurrence rate of knee joint injury, knowledge must be promoted to decrease the occurrence rate of injury from :subjective and objective aspects, so as to provide a better guarantee for the physical health of martial arts sportsmen.

AB Aims: Atypical cytologies were categorized as Bethesda category III (atipia with unknown significance, follicular lesions with unknown significance, AUS/FLUS) and Bethesda category IV (follicular neoplasm or suspicious for follicular neoplasm, FN/SFN) in Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytopathology (BSRTC). Tins study was planned to define the contribution of clinical and radiological features in the course of action for AUS/FLUS and FN/SFN thyroid nodules.
   Materials and methods: The age, gender, nodule size and definitive pathological results of 124 patients treated with total thyroidectomy after preoperative diagnosis of AUS/FLUS and FN/SFN lesions were recorded. Radiological features were grouped as increased vascularity, irregular borders, microcalcification, cystic component, presence of hypoechoic halo, hypoechogenicity and extraglandular involvement.
   Results: The malignancy rates in AUS/FLUS and FN/SFN lesions were 8% and 163%, respectively. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was repeated only in 8 patients among 75 patients diagnosed as AUS/FLUS, but the diagnosis was not changed in direction to follow-up. The presence of irregular borders at ultrasonography, increased vascularity, microcalcification, presence of hypoechoic halo and hypoechoic nodules were found to be related to the malignancy in AUS/FLUS group. On the other hand, age less than 50, presence of irregular borders, increased vascularity and presence of microcalcifications were found to be related to the malignancy in FN/SFN group.
   Conclusions: The success of BSRTC in prevention of unnecessary thyroidectomies shows differences between clinics. Radiological criteria apart from patient's related factors play an important role in clinical judgement. Microcalcifications seem to be the most sensitive criteria both in AUS/FLUS and FN/SFN lesions. Irregular border was the criteria with the highest specificity in both categories.

AB Introduction: Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is one of the respiratory diseases associated with obesity. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of one night of bi-level positive airway pressure (BPAP) treatment on the basal metabolic rate (BMR) of OHS patients.
   Materials and methods: The BMR of OHS patients who were newly diagnosed and hospitalized for BPAP treatment was measured with indirect calorimetry before and after one night (at least 8 hours) BPAP treatment. Additionally association between BMR and parameters such as gender, smoking, body-mass index (BMI), oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) were assessed.
   Results: Twenty newly diagnosed OHS patients were included in the study. A statistically significant difference in BMR and VO2 levels were observed after one night of BPAP treatment (p=0.01 and p=0.02, respectively). There was no statistically significant relationship between the reduction in BMR and gender, smoking and BMI. Lower VCO2 levels were measured after the BPAP treatment but there was no statistical significance.
   Conclusion: Even short term use of BPAP treatment in patients with OHS may reduce the BMR by improving pulmonary mechanics and respiratory muscle capacity and reducing breathing effort. Longer studies with more patients are needed to evaluate both short and long term effect of BPAP treatment on BMR.

AB Introduction: End-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure is a widely used measurement in clinical practice to monitor the current condition of the respiratory system. The aim of the present study is to demonstrate the changes in the levels of end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure during supine, Trendelenburg, and reverse Trendelenburg positions in healthy individuals.
   Materials and methods: The end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure were measured in supine, Trendelenburg (30%), and reverse Trendelenburg (30%) positions using a facemask connected to an anesthesia machine (Siemens Kion, Sweden) after fixing the patient on the related position for five minutes. A 30-minutes resting period was provided to the patient for the accuracy of the end tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure measurements following each positioning.
   Results: The mean end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure level in reverse Trendelenburg position was significantly lower than in supine position (p < 0.01). The mean end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure level in Trendelenburg position was found to be higher when compared to reverse Trendelenburg position (p < 0.01). In supine and Trendelenburg positions, the mean end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure level was higher in males than in females (p = 0.026 and p = 0.043, respectively).
   Conclusion: The findings of the present study revealed that Trendelenburg position may cause increased end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure levels while reverse Trendelenburg leads to a decrease in levels.

DE Sedi Herba; rats after exercise; liver tissue; free radicals
AB Objective: The research aims to explore Sedi Herba's effect on the metabolism of free radicals in liver tissues of rats after exercise and its impact on exercise capacity.
   Methods: 24 healthy SD rats (male) were randomly divided into the control group (A), exhaustion group (B), and exhaustion and medicine group (C). All groups are provided with free access to water and essential fodder. Subjects in Group C were administered Sedi Herba 3 hours before exercise, 400 mg/kg, through gavage. During the experiment, the control group was feed without any exercise while Group B and C went through a one-week adaptive training on the treadmill, which is further followed with a seven-week-long endurance exercise with increasing load. At the last day of the experiment, subjects from Group B and C were forced to exercise to exhaustion and decapitated immediately, while those from the control group were killed without exercise. Liver tissues from all subjects were collected and made into tissue homogenate as required in this experiment. Indicators of body defense system against free radicals were measured, including content of malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation, activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), activity of catalase (CAT), activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC).
   Results: The increase in Group C in SOD activity, CAT activity, GSH-Px activity and the T-AOC was statistically significant, as compared to the other groups, among which that of SOD and GSH-Px far exceeded the data collected in Group B (P<0.01). Moreover, content of MDA in Group C decreased significantly (P<0.01) when compared with group B. Further, Sedi Herba extended the exercise before exhaustion for 21.30%.
   Conclusion: Sedi Herba can significantly improve the activity of free radical-clearing enzymes in liver tissue of rats and the exercise capacity.

ID REPERFUSION
AB Objective: to explore the effects of sedum sarmentosum on the free radical metabolism in myocardial tissue and the exercise performance of intensively exercising rats.
   Methods: 24 healthy and male rats (Sprague Dawley, SD) were randomly divided into three groups, namely Group A: rest control group, Group B: exhaustive exercise group, and Group C: exhaustive exercise and medication group; all the rats in the three groups had free access to food and water; rats in Group C were administered sedum sarmentosum by gavage 3hours before taking exercise every day and the daily dose was 400 mg/Kg; while rats in Group A were kept in resting-state, Group B and C first took a week-long adaptive training on the treadmill followed by 7-week endurance training with increasing load till exhaustion. Thereafter all the animals were decapitated. Myocardial tissue of the rats was obtained for preparing tissue homogenate. Indicators of the defense mechanism against free radicals including the amount of Malondialdehyde (MDA) which is lipid peroxide, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and total anti-oxidant capacity (T-AOC) were measured.
   Results: rats in Group C showed significantly elevated SOD activity, CAT activity, GSH-Px activity, and TAC compared with Croup A and B, and the differences between Group C and Group B in SOD activity and GSH-Px activity were highly significant (P<0.01); the amount of MDA in Group B was lower than Group C and the difference was highly significant (P<0.01); sedum sarmentosum helped to extend the duration of exhaustive exercising of the rats by 21.30%.
   Conclusions: sedum sarmentosum could notably improve the activity of enzymes involved in scavenging free radicals in rat myocardial tissue and enhance the animal's exercising performance.

AB Introduction: Obesity is a modifiable risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The purpose of this study was to examine the success rate and the effects of an outpatient weight loss program on obese OSA patients.
   Materials and methods: This prospective study included 34 apneic obese patients (body mass index 33.7 +/- 5.8 kg/m(2), age 47.1 +/- 8.7 years). Intervention program consisted of 12-week program of moderate intensity exercise (40-60% of HRR) and individualized diet. A weight loss of >= 3% from baseline was considered as "clinically significant weight loss" according with the guidelines of American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). Polysomnographic, anthropometric and metabolic measurements were taken before and after the significant weight loss. Data were analyzed using the Chi square test, Wilcoxon signed ranks test and Mann Whitney U test.
   Results: Clinically significant weight loss was achieved by 18 patients (53%), and 16 patients (47%) were unsuccessful. It was significant that mild /moderate OSA patients were mostly successful (68%), while the majority of severe patients (75%) were unsuccessful (P = 0.016). There were significant improvements in anthropometric, metabolic and sleep parameters (apnea-hypopnea index, O-2 desaturation index, Epworth sleepiness score) of successful patients after 12 weeks program.
   Conclusion: Outpatient weight loss programs are more convenient for patients with mild /moderate OSA. However, obese patients with severe OSA have more barriers to perform exercise. Inpatient weight loss program seems like a better option for obtaining effective weight loss in severe apneic patients.

DE Gingival hyperplasia; calcium channel blockers; amlodipine
ID CALCIUM-CHANNEL BLOCKERS; PREVALENCE
AB Introduction: Drug induced gingival hyperplasia is the overgrowth of gingival ephitelium and submucosa which may cause bleeding and loss of teeth. Certain anticonvulsing, immunosuppressive and antihypertensive drugs are the underlying cause in most cases. Among them, cases due to amlodipine are very rare. Here we discuss the topic along with a case of gingival overgrowth induced by amlodipine.
   Case presentation: A sixty-three-year-old male presented with gingival overgrowth and hemorrhage. He was on warfarin and amlodipin because of prosthetic aortic valve and primary hypertension. He had gingival hyperplasia increasingly growing in the last couple of months. His antihypertensive regimen was readjusted with cessation of amlodipine.
   Discussion: The pathogenesis of drug induced gingival hyperplasia is not totally understood yet, it is obviously related to gingival infalmmation. Treatment strategy is cessation of the inducing agent, providing oral hygiene and gingivectomy if necessary. Concomitant use of warfarin in our patient was another contributing factor for his tendency to gingival hemorrhage. Replacing amlodipine with different antihypertensives and appropriate dental care ensured the recovery of gingival lesions in the follow up period. The patient continued warfarin treatment without hemorrhagic complications.
   Conclusion: Calcium channel blockers (CCB) are antihypertensives that we commonly prescribe. We may be able to avoid serious complications if we bear in mind that these drugs may cause gingival overgrowth especially when dental care is poor.

AB Introduction: We purposed to investigate the effects of Endothelin-1 gene polymorphisms (Lys198Asn and rs10478694) that are supposed to play role in atherothrombotic process in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).
   Materials and methods: This prospective study was performed on 320 participants between January 2013 and July 2014. Participants were divided into two groups: Group 1 (PAD group) included 160 patients with PAD (mean age: 54 +/- 14 years, 116 males), and Group 2 (control group) included 160 participants (mean age: 51 +/- 11 years, 112 males) with normal physical examination and duplex ultrasonography findings for PAD. Groups were compared with each other according to clinical and demographic characteristics, levels of some biochemical parameters, and particularly Endothelin-1 gene polymorphisms were determined by real time polymerase chain reaction.
   Results: The incidences of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, family history of cardiovascular diseases and fasting glucose levels were significantly higher in PAD group. Both groups were statistically similar according to levels of total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, urea and creatinine. Comparison of groups according to Endothelin-1 gene polymorphisms and allele frequencies did not yield any statistically significant differences.
   Conclusion: We found that Endothelin-1 gene polymorphisms were not associated with PAD. Further studies on different polymorphisms of Endothelin-1 may be beneficial.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study was to investigate the value of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) who had not been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM).
   Materials and methods: This prospective study was performed on a total of 224 participants between June 2013 and June 2014. The participants were divided into two groups, as follows: Group 1 (PAD group) included 112 patients with PAD (mean age: 57 +/- 12 years, 84 males) without a diagnosis of DM, while Group 2 (control group) included 112 participants (mean age: 54 +/- 11 years, 80 males) with normal physical examination results and normal duplex ultrasonography findings when examined for PAD. The groups were compared according to the clinical and demographic characteristics, levels of some biochemical parameters, and particularly HbA1c levels. Thus, the importance of HbA1c levels in patients with PAD was investigated.
   Results: The proportions of hypertension, smoking, family history of DM, and fasting glucose levels were significantly higher in PAD group. The groups were statistically similar in terms of levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, urea and creatinine. In PAD group, the average HbA1c level was significantly higher than in control group.
   Conclusion: Routine screening of HbA1c in patients with PAD would be useful for the early diagnosis of prediabetes and DM, as well as for the prevention of the potential complications of DM.

AB Introduction: This study was conducted aimed to investigate the job stress in nurses of Imam Reza Hospital, Kermanshah, 2015.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted with participation of 216 nurses employed in Imam Reza subspecialty hospital. Data gathering tool was Expanded Nursing Stress Scale (ENSS) to measure nurses job related stressors. Data were analyzed using the software AMOS22.
   Results: There was a significant relationship between job stress and its dimensions. Fitting indexes values including AIC, BCC, ECVI, and MECVI in proposed model were 286.950, 288.054, 0.747, and 0.750 respectively. Among the Efficiency indexes, CFI and IFI with the amount of 0.941 were more than the rest of the indexes.
   Conclusion: Given the significance of the relationship between job stress and its dimensions, it seems that there's a lot of stress among nurses. The patient's suffering and death, and uncertainty concerning treatment were the most important factors for job stress.

AB Aim: This study sought to explore factors affecting Iranian family donors' motivation for kidney donation. Background: Family donor kidney transplant is among the most ideal treatment options for chronic renal failure due to the greater compatibility of donor and recipient's human leukocyte antigen. Consequently, identifying factors affecting family donors' motivation for kidney donation is essential for members of transplant teams, particularly nurses, and can help them adopt strategies for encouraging family members to donate.
   Methods: This was a descriptive qualitative study to which fourteen family donors (six females and eight males) were recruited purposively from transplantation centers of all teaching hospitals affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. The study data were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews and were analyzed by using the conventional content analysis approach.
   Findings: Factors affecting Iranian family donors' motivation for kidney donation fell into three main categories including feelings of love and responsibility, spiritual motives, and greater success rate of family donor transplant. The first category consisted of the two sub-categories of close and constant companionship and inability to tolerate recipient's discomfort.
   Conclusion: The findings of the present study indicate that both personal factors (such as feeling of responsibility and spiritual motives) and organizational factors (such as informing family members about the importance and the benefits of family donation) are among the main motives for kidney donation by family members. Employing strategies for promoting these factors could facilitate the process of kidney donation by family members.

AB Aim: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the donation outcomes among related kidney donors
   Methods: this study is a descriptive study and in order to analyze the data, conventional content analysis was used. The sample of this study consisted of 16 related donors (7 female and 9 male) from 4 kidney transplantation centers of hospitals affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The instrument used in this study consisted of semi-structured interviews: face to face and on the phone.
   Results: After analyzing data, two main categories including individual and family outcomes were emerged. Individual outcomes: donating new life and spiritual opportunities for the donor. Family outcomes: deeper intimacy of families, gratitude and respect to the donor as well as strengthening family ties. According to the findings of donors' points of view in this study, the donation outcomes were described positive.
   Conclusion: Related kidney donation is an ideal option among other donation options. The findings of the present study indicated positive individual and family outcomes among related donors. Therefore, in order to improve the culture of related donation, it is suggested that to facilitate and support related donation, appropriate strategies should be presented by the officials and those involved in the transplantation team.

AB Introduction: Cardiac diseases are of the most prevalent causes of death in the developed countries and the whole world as well. According to the forecasts by the World Health Organization, the diseases will be the main cause of death in the world by 2020. The most common surgery operation in coronary artery disease is coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and medical follow-up (MFU). Survival of 3VD and severe ventricular heart failure patients in two groups of CABG and MFU was compared.
   Methodology: A retrospective cohort study on 269 patients between 2009 and 2011 was carried out in Imam Ali Medical Educational Center. The 3VD patients underwent coronary artery angiography and had EF <30% so that CABG was prescribed form them. Male and female constituted 78% and 22% of the study group and average age of the participants was 61.40 +/- 9.07. The patients were categorized in two groups of CABG and MFU. Follow up was carried out until November 2014 to record any case of death. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression were used for data analysis. All the analyses were performed in STATA (12) with sig.= 0.05.
   Findings: The results showed that despite their clear effects on development of coronary artery problems, the demographic information had no significant effect on clinical outcome of the patients. One month, six months, one year, and three years survival of CABG patients was 96.7%, 95.3%, 94.7%, and 89.8% respectively and these figures for the pharmaceutical medication patients were 97%, 92.5%, 86.3%, and 83.4% respectively. In addition, survival term in MFU and CABG patients was 52.80 +/- 1.64 and 57.15 +/- 1.23 months respectively. The most important factor effective on survival of patients according to Cox regression model was left ventricular EF.
   Conclusion: The findings indicated that survival rate was significantly related to the type of medical intervention. That is, survival rate of CABG group was higher than that of MFU group. Risk rate of CABG and MFU patients increased considerably after 30 and 20 months respectively.

AB Purpose and background: Ischemic heart diseases (IHDs) occurring as a result of the lack of adequate supply of blood and oxygen to part of the myocardium, are the most common causes of death and disability in developed countries. Since platelets play a fundamental role in the onset of atherosclerosis and coronary clots, assessment of platelet volume indices (PVI) can be important in the prediction and detection of coronary facts. This research was conducted to compare the Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) between patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and healthy individuals.
   Materials and methods: The study population in this cross-sectional survey included 36 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 36 healthy individuals whose PVIs were compared with each other. After questioning and recording the demographic data of both groups, their blood samples were taken for testing the platelet indices and the results for the MPV were registered in a questionnaire and analyzed using the SPSS software.
   Findings: the mean and standard deviation for the platelet volume (PV) in patients with AMI and healthy individuals (control group) were +/- 0.95, 10.01 and +/- 0.29, 9.07, respectively. The mean difference in the PV between the two groups was statistically significant (P.value = 0.000). No significant difference was observed between the MPV and the variables of age and gender. Also, no significant differences were observed between the MPV and risk factors for high blood pressure, diabetes, cigarette smoking and body mass index (BMI).
   Conclusion: This study showed that the MPV is clinically important and a high level of this index can independently be considered as a prognostic factor for cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.

AB Introduction: Constipation is among prevalent problems in patients. In heart-related cardiac cares unit of hospitals, lack of mobility, consumption of narcotics for pain relief, lack of appetite and limitation of food consumption are the reasons for constipation in more than 70% of occasions. Esabgol, in traditional medicine, is used very much as a laxative drug. In the present study, effects of Esabgol and magnesium hydroxidesyrup on constipation of Angina pectoris patients in cardiac care unit are examined.
   Method: The present study is a clinical trial with a semi-empirical method which was carried out on two groups of patients in cardiac care unit of heart-related problems of Isa Ibn Maryam hospital in Isfahan. One group was consisted of 48 and the other was consisted of 62 persons. Sampling method was targeted sampling in similar conditions. In each group before treatment and until 5 days after it, number of stool exertion and conditions during exertion were verified by questionnaire. Then results of using Esabgol and magnesium hydroxide before and after treatment were compared between the two groups.
   Findings: statistical analysis before and after treatment showed that mean of stool excretion numbers increased in two groups and is higher in treatment group in comparison to control group. Significant findings in test group in comparison to control group was lack of complete discharge 2.5% and 16.7%, painful discharge 5.0 percent in comparison to 14.6%, pushing too much 25 percent and 43.8% and ball-shaped and hard stool 12.5% and 31.3%.
   Discussion and conclusion: Esabgol in Angina pectoris patients hospitalized in special cares part of heart-related problems was effective in prevention and treatment of constipation of these patients with increasing numbers of discharge, reduction of incomplete discharge, pushing and painful discharge, and also reduction of hard and ball-shaped stool. It was significantly more effective in comparison to hydroxide magnesium syrup, so it is offered that in special parts of heart-related problems Esabgol powder is usable for prevention and treatment of constipation.

AB Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogen in food products that poses a great danger for the human food industry. This study was performed for evaluating the effect of the chemical compound and antimicrobial activity of Cuminum cyminum seed extract on the inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria in silver carp mince. The extract was extracted from the plant via steam distillation using a Clevenger apparatus. Next, its chemical compound was analyzed using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) instrument. The major compound constituting the Cuminum cyminum extract, was cumin aldehyde (20.27%). The effect of different concentrations of Cuminum cyminum (0%, 0.015%, 0.03%, 09.06%, 0.0% and 0.1%) on the growth behavior of the said bacterium was investigated at 4 degrees C for 21 days. The results showed that the bacteria growth stopped up to 6 days in different concentrations of Cuminum cyminum extract. Also, the effect of Cuminum cyminum extract in controlling the bacterium possessed significant differences (p<0.05). Different concentrations of Cuminum cyminum extract for controlling the growth of the bacterium at the above temperature possessed significant statistical differences compared to the control samples (p<0.05). But low concentrations of the Cuminum cyminum extract (0.015% and 0.03%) did not possess significant differences in inhibiting the growth of the bacterium (p>0.05). Whereas high concentrations of the extract used for inhibiting the growth of the bacteria showed significant statistical differences (p<0.05). Suitable inhibitory effects on the growth of the Staphylococcus aureus in silver carp mince were observed at concentrations of 0.09% and 0.1% of Cuminum cyminum extract. Based on the findings of this research it can be said that the extract of the Cuminum cyminum has strong bactericidal properties and is introduced as a natural food preservative instead of its chemical and industrial variations.

DT Article
DE Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis; tuberculosis; whole lung lavage
ID COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR; AUTOANTIBODIES
AB Introduction: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disease of unknown origin, characterized by impaired surfactant metabolism that leads to abnormal accumulation of amorphous phospholipoprotein material in the alveoli. The association between PAP and tuberculosis (TB) has been rarely reported.
   Case presentation: We present the case of a 33 year-old man diagnosed with PAP and complicated with pulmonary TB. The suspicion of PAP was based on chest computed tomography with " crazy-paving" pattern, and the diagnosis was sustained by eosinophilic PAS (Periodic acid-Schiff) positive lipoproteinaceous material in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Two procedures of wholelung therapeutic lavage were performed with good clinical results. Three years after PAP diagnosis, the patient was diagnosed with TB (bronchial aspirate smears and culture were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis).
   Conclusion: Pulmonary TB may occur as a complication in an idiopathic PAP due to reduced phagocytic and chemotaxis capacity of alveolar macrophages or as a possible nosocomial Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission by periodic bronchoscopy exams and washings.

TI CLINICAL VALUE OF CYTOKINES COMBINED WITH THE BISAP SCORING SYSTEM IN
   EARLY PREDICTION OF ACUTE PANCREATITIS SEVERITY
SO ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA
LA English
DT Article
DE BISAP scoring system; cytokine; acute pancreatitis; predictive value
AB Acute pancreatitis, a common disease, has recently shown increasing incidence. The overall mortality rate of acute pancreatitis is about 5%-10%, but if acute pancreatitis continues to deteriorate, severity of the condition will rise. Therefore, early prediction of severity of the disease is necessary. To fully demonstrate the value of cytokines combined with the BISAP scoring system for early prediction of acute pancreatitis severity, BISAP scoring, traditional Ranson scoring and CT scoring were carried out for 2380 patients with acute pancreatitis admitted in January 2012 to October 2015. Receiver operating curve (ROC) was adopted for accuracy analysis of the three scoring systems. The results show that ROC curve area of BISAP scoring for severity of acute pancreatitis, concurrent symptoms, organ failure and death, etc. enjoys the highest similarity with the actual situation. This fully proves the high clinical value of the BISAP scoring system in early prediction of acute pancreatitis severity, which can provide scientific treatment evidence for medical personnel and improve treatment efficiency.

AB A large number of previous drug experiments revealed that there are strong inherent connections between the drug's molecular structures and the bio-medical and pharmacology characteristics. The forgotten topological, index is introduced to be applied into chemical compound and drug molecular structures, which is quite helpful for medical and pharmaceutical workers to test the biological features of new drugs. Such approaches are widely applied in developing areas which are not rich enough to afford the relevant equipment and chemical reagents. In this paper, using drug structure analysis and edge dividing technique, we determine the forgotten topological index of some molecular structures which appear widely in various classes of drugs.

AB Background and aim: Chewing gums have been suggested as an adjunctive method to improve the oral hygiene recently. In addition; due to the anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties of the propolis; its positive properties can be combined with the chewing gum's characteristics when using propolis as a component of chewing gum in order to improve the oral hygiene indices. This study evaluated the effects of biologic chewing gum enriched by propolis on the clinical periodontal indices.
   Materials an methods: In this double-blind clinical trial; 20 eligible volunteers were selected and used Propolis-contained or propolis-free chewing gums (5 sticks daily for 20 minutes after main meals) for 3 days with two weeks wash-out time. In the third period; the participants did not used any chewing gum. They were asked not to use other chewing gums or other oral hygiene habits in the study periods. The routine oral hygiene habits were followed in the wash-out period. Plaque (4) and gingival (7) indices were measured before and after using chewing gums and the data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance in the 3 groups. The paired comparisons were done by Schaeffer test.
   Results: Following the consumption of propolis gum, the mean total gingival indices (13/0); gingival index of lingual surface of the teeth (07/0); buccal surfaces of the teeth (19/0); maxilla (11/0); mandible (16/0), was reduced (0001 / 0p <) compared to values seen before taking the gum, while the values of the two groups; one consuming no gum and the other using propolis-free gum, increased. On the other hand, the increase in plaque index in the period without gum was significantly more than the periods of chewing gum containing proposes and proposes-free gum but the difference between the two types of chewing gum were not significant.
   Conclusion: Together with the positive effects of the proposes-contained chewing gum in the improvement of gingival index and its ability to prevent an increase in plaques; the gum can be used as an adjunctive method to improve oral hygiene level in the eligible individuals.

ID HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER; HEALTH PROBLEM; SHOCK SYNDROME
AB Dengue fever is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes and is self-limiting in most cases but can be severe and fatal. This disease is endemicto Southeast Asia and its outbreak occurs there every 2-3years. The present paper aims to show the occurrence of isolated cases of this disease in Iran and prevents the wide spread and serious epidemic that may happen in the future through quick diagnosis and other health measures. This study was based on a report about a 52-year-old man who suffered from fever and headache, maculopapularrashes on the chest and upper limbs, runny nose, and muscle pain three week safter returning from Bahra into Iran and his tests confirmed leukopenia (2900) and thrombocytopenia (9700). The patient's blood sample was sent to Pastor Laboratory for dengue fever test and the result was positive. Although this is the third registered reported case in Iran, in this case, unlike previous ones, patient had been bitten by an infected mosquito inside Iran. Generally, this disease should be strictly tested and controlled in people who are returning from endemic areas, in the tropical regions and when it is raining, and in patients who exhibit fever and other symptoms.

ID TRIMETHOPRIM-SULFAMETHOXAZOLE
AB Introduction: Severe complications occur each year due to bacterial pathogens that cause diarrhea. Most diarrhea related mortality occurs in developing countries.
   Case report: a 49 year old male was admitted to hospital due to generalized abdominal pain, watery and then infectious diarrhea two weeks prior to admission. The patient experienced weakness, lethargy, bone pain and headache during hospitalization. Broad spectrum antibiotics were administrated. However, the patient's condition worsened and he went into comma that led to death. Shigella Flexneri resistant to treatment was isolated from stool culture.
   Conclusion: This was a treatment resistant diarrhea due to Shigella Flexneri. Gastrointestinal Shigella Flexneri infection and its increasing antibiotic resistance are turning into a worldwide burden. Recognizing its resistance and antibacterial sensitivity can play a crucial role in patient treatment.

TI THE INCURABLE WOUNDS OF THE SOUL: SUICIDE AS A TRAGIC SELF-AFFIRMATION
   IN ART AND LITERATURE
SO ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA
LA English
DT Article
DE suicide; medicine; history; art; literature; anthropology
AB This article examines the theme of suicide from a cultural-historical point of view, using art and literature as its sources, particularly in the nineteenth and twentieth century. Art and literature can be used as therapies and medications, as an excellent way of expressing existential distress that, in most cases, requires a symbolic and evocative language. The pain cannot be contained in a definition but rather in a story. So the truth of medical science needs another truth, one that includes the whole person, her psyche and her physicality. The theme of death and suicide concerns the essential questions of human life, issues which statistics, clinical and experimental researches do not address. The art and literature lay bare what a person feels, allowing immediate access to his experience. They can be a response to the suffering and be salvation and medicine, place of disclosure of the human labour on the disease, be it physical, psychological or existential. The modern age is dominated by a medical approach that explains the suicide as a result of a pathological derangement. For Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), suicide was the product of a mental illness.
   The author's aim is to underline how the artistic-literary language is a privileged instrument to study mankind's mood and existential status.

AB Introduction: Increase in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with cardiovascular risk. However, the relationship between atherosclerosis and VAT has not yet been adequately studied in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to assess the relationship among VAT, adipokines, and atherosclerosis in patients with CKD.
   Materials and methods: 45 healthy control, 53 predialysis patients, and 52 hemodialysis patients have been enrolled in the study. Intima media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery, and VAT measurements were evaluated via ultrasonography.
   Results: IMT (p:0.002), VAT (p:0.021), adiponectin (p<0.001) and pentraxin-3 (p:0.003) were higher in predialysis patients than healthy controls. The values of IMT (p<0.001), VAT (p:0.0014), adiponectin (p:0.005), pentraxin-3 (p: <0.001), C reactive protein (CRP) (p:0.009), triglyceride (p: <0.001) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) (p<0.001), were higher in hemodialysis patients than healthy controls. VAT was positively correlated with CRP(r: 0, 23 p: 0.005), IMT (r: 0.347 p<0.001), body mass index (BMI) (r: 0.33 p<0.001), and negatively correlated with creatinine clearance (R: -0.245 p: 0.003). VAT is independently related with adiponectin (beta:-0.213 p: 0.008), BMI (beta:0.369, P<0.001), and CRP (beta:0.164, P:0.032) in multiple regression analysis. IMT was positively correlated with VAT (r: 0.347 p<0.001), CRP (r: 0.186 p:0.022), age (r: 0.333 p<0.001), BMI (r: 0.444 p<0.001) in all participants.
   Conclusion: These findings show that VAT is a strong risk factor for atherosclerosis in patients with CKD. However IMT was not correlated with adiponectin, pentraxin-3, and leptin in patients with CKD. Also sonographic measurement of VAT could be useful to stratify the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD.

AB Introduction: Aging is associated with an increase in the risk of falls and fractures in elderly osteoporotic women in addition to low bone mass and muscle atrophy. We aimed to assess relationship between paraspinal muscle thickness and bone mineral den shy in postmenopausal women.
   Materials and methods: Overall, 95 postmenopausal women were included into the study. Back pain was assessed by using Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the lumbar spine and femoral neck. Postmenopausal women were classified into 3 groups as osteopenia, osteoporosis and normal BMD according to WHO. Quality of life was assessed by using Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO-41). Paraspinal muscle thickness was measured from 4 cm lateral to midline by sonography at the level of the 10th thoracic spine.
   Results: No significant difference was detected between groups regarding duration of weekly exercises, back pain (NRS) and QUALEFFO values (p>0.05). In the osteoporosis group, mean muscle thickness was found to be lower in both right and left side when compared to those in osteopenia and normal BMD group (p<0.01). In addition, mean muscle thickness was found to be lower in both right and left side in osteopenia when compared to normal BMD group (p<0.01).
   Conclusion: Our study indicates that reduction in bone mass is related to decrease in muscle mass.

AB Introduction: In the course of time, many structural and functional changes occur at different levels, and they are all known to contribute towards aging. The purpose of the study was to determine the changes in the levels of folic acid, vitamin B12, free T3 and T4, TOS (total oxidant status) and TAS (total antioxidant status) as the rat ages from 6 to 36 months old.
   Materials and methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained, grown, and divided into five equal groups as follows: Group I (6 months old), Group II (12 months old), Group III (18 months old), Group IV (24 months old) and Group V (36 months old). The levels of folic acid, vitamin B12,free T3 and T4, total oxidant and antioxidant capacity in the blood were analyzed.
   Results: Folic acid level in Group I was detected to be significantly higher compared to the other groups (P<0.001), and vitamin B12 levels in Group V were determined to be significantly lower than. those of the other groups (P<0.001). Free T3 level in Group II and free T4 level in Group I were measured significantly higher compared to the other groups (P<0.005, P<0.01), and TAS level in Group V was determined to be significantly lower compared to Group I and II (P<0.05).
   Conclusions: Changes in the levels of folic acid, vitamin B12, thyroid hormones, and total oxidant and antioxidant capacities, might contribute to the proper diagnosis and treatment procedures of age-related diseases.

The association between vitamin D insufficiency and coronary artery disease, heart failure and hypertension were well demonstrated. Nevertheless the impact of vitamin D insufficiency on arrhythmia remains unclear.
   Materials and methods: Low vitamin D and control groups consisted of 74 and 80 patients respectively. Parameters of arrhythmia including QT and P wave dispersion, SDNN, SDNN-index, pNN50, RMSSD, HF and LF as well as the number of atrial pre-systole, atrial pair; supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular pre-systole, ventricular pair, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, sustained ventricular tachycardia were compared between the patients with vitamin D insufficiency and controls.
   Results: Maximum QTc, minimumQTc, QTc dispersion, maximum p wave, minimum p wave, p wave dispersion, SDNN, SDNN index, RMSSD, pNN50, HF and LF values were found to be similar between low vitamin D and control groups (p>0,05). Furthermore there was not a significant difference in the number of atrial pre-systole, atrial pair, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular pre-systole, ventricular pail; non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and sustained ventricular tachycardia (p>0,05). Additionally, serum vitamin D levels were not found to be correlated with QTc dispersion and SDNN (r=-0,010, p=0,933 and r=-0,034, p=0,777 respectively).
   Conclusion: Serum vitamin D levels do not have any impact on the current arrhythmic status and the risk of developing arrhythmia. Beside the questioned value of vitamin D in general cardiovascular outcomes, arrhythmia is unlikely to be a component of the possible effects of vitamin D insufficiency on cardiovascular system.

TI DOES MEAN PLATELET VOLUME SHOW DISEASE ACTIVITY IN BEHCET'S DISEASE?
SO ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA
LA English
DT Article
DE Behcet's disease; Mean platelet volume; disease activity
ID RECURRENT APHTHOUS STOMATITIS; THROMBOSIS; STATE
AB Introduction: The mean platelet volume (MPV) shows the average size of platelets in blood and indicates platelet function and activation, which are correlated with thrombosis and inflammation. Platelet activation might be related with the pathophysiology of Behcet's disease (BD) since this disease is also prone to inflammation and thrombosis.
   We aimed to determine whether MPV can be used as a marker for BD in disease activation and severity.
   Materials and methods: The data of 33 BD patients during the active and the inactive periods of the disease were collected retrospectively, and the results were then compared with 35 recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) patients and 60 healthy controls who were age- and gender-matched. If at least two clinical findings were present, BD was considered to be active.
   Results: In the active period of BD, the MPV levels (8,6 fL) were slightly higher than those in RAS (8,4 fL) and control groups (8,4 fL) (p=0,148), however, the MPV levels of active period (8.66 fL) were significantly higher than the inactive period (83 fL), (p=0.007). Moreover, 8 BD patients with vascular event history had significantly higher levels of MPV during active (9,3 fL) than inactive period (7,3 fL) of the disease (p=0,012).
   Conclusion: In conclusion, elevation of MPV levels should be considered for each patient individually, and during follow-ups MPV measurements can be valuable to determine disease activity. Additionally, an elevation in MPV could alarm clinician as BD is getting activated and that there might be an increased risk of vascular involvement with BD.

AB Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome might have a deleterious effect on ventricular repolarization, reflected by an altered frontal planar QRS/T angle.
   Material and method: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of a total 120 patients underwent overnight polysomnography test. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to apnea hypopnea index (AHI) values (< 5/h, 5-15/h, 15-30/h, and > 30/h). The frontal planar QRS/T angle was defined as absolute difference between the frontal QRS wave axis and T-wave axis on resting 12-lead surface electrocardiography (ECG).
   Results: The average frontal planar QRS-T angle of all participants was 42.79 +/- 38.75 degrees. The frontal planar QRS-T angle is increased with the severity of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and significantly highest in severe OSAS group (AHI >30/h) (p<0.001). In post hoc analysis, we found statistically significant differences as regard mean frontal planar QRS-T angle between normal (AHI 0-5/h) and severe OSAS (AHI > 30/h) (p = 0.002), and between mild OSAS (AHI 5-15/h) and severe OSAS (AHI > 30/h) (p = 0.002). Age, male sex, left ventricular ejection fraction and obstructive apnea index showed sigriOcant association with frontal planar QRS/T angle in multivariate linear regression analysis (for all, p < 0.005).
   Conclusion: The frontal planar QRS/T angle is significantly widened in patients with newly diagnosed OSAS compared with controls and increased by the severity of the disease determined by AHI. This finding might help the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmic susceptibility in OSAS patients.

AB Introduction: An index for Pulmonaty Artery Computed Tomography Index Ratio (PACTOIR) may have important prognostic and therapeutic implications and as well as providing a standard to evaluate thrombolytic therapy response. The aim of this study was to determine whether PACTOIR predict the thrombolytic therapy in the treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE).
   Materials and methods: This retrospective study was conducted by reviewing charts of 52 patients (aged >= 18 years) who were admitted to our emergency department (ED) with initial diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and confirmed diagnosis of PE by Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CPTA). The patients were divided into two groups as follows: Group 1 (n=14) consisted of the patients who received thrombolytic therapy and Group 2 (n=38) consisted of the patients who did not receive thrombolytic therapy. PACTOIR was calculated in both groups to estimate thrombus load. We evaluated the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy by comparing the levels of D-dieter and Troponin I.
   Results: Mean value for PACTOIR, D-dimer and Troponin I levels were 56.4 (%), 6.21 (mg/L) and 0.35 (mu g-IL) in Group 1 whereas they were 20.46 (%), 220 (mg/L) and 0.11 (mu g/L) in Group 2, respectively. Significant difference was detected between Group 1 and Group 2 (p<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity values were calculated as 92.9% and 89.5% for PACTOIR, whereas they were 85.7% and 78.9% for D-dimer, respectively. These values were found to be 78.6% and 65.8% for Troponin I, respectively.
   Conclusion: Based on our results, sensitivity to show PE severity and to determine thrombolytic therapy was significant when compared to D-dimer and Troponin I. In addition, we concluded that PACTOIR is the parameter with greatest sensitivity in determining the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy.

AB Wheat bread as an integral part of the food basket is of paramount importance to meet the nutritional requirements and nutrient supply. Recently, there has been an increased attention to bulky breads because modern methods of processing and baking dough are in a way through which bread waste is reduced and they result in longer lasting of bread and preserve bread vitamins and proteins. Moreover, having additives in baking industry has also become more common. So that, they are generally used to improve the quality, to enhance efficiency and ease of working with dough, to delay staling, and hence to reduce waste. Neural Networks are a branch of artificial intelligence with computer algorithms on different classification and pattern recognition, parameter estimation, and so on. The aim of this research study was to use artificial network in order to predict appropriate models for the effect of adding hydrocolloids on baguette bread staling. The results showed that adding hydrocolloids would delay staling and adding guar in a long time has the greatest impact on baguette bread sustainability.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this article is to review of nanotechnology, nanomedicine and nanodentistry in the present situation, as well as in the time to come.
   Background: Nanotechnology is a phenomenon present since the late 1950' s, its manipulation of matter on the molecular and atomic levels. And currently find a strong ground in the field of dentistry. Dentistry is frequently facing revolutions in order to provide a most reliable and comfortable therapeutic options have made dental procedures less painful, fast, reliable, effective and safe for the patients. Recently nanotechnology has emerged as a new science exploiting specific phenomena and direct manipulation of materials on nanoscale. Application of nanotechnology in dentistry holds promise for the maintenance of comprehensive dental care by employing non material's including tissue engineering and ultimately nanorobots. A day may soon come when nanodentistry will succeed in maintaining near-perfect oral health through the aid of nanorobotics, non materials and biotechnology. The purpose of this review paper highlights the current status and the role of non material's and their potential to be used in the diagnosis and clinical applications in management of oral diseases.
   Methods and materials: The literature review has been conducted from 2000 till 2014 in Pub Med; Google Scholar; Science Direct; Medline databases were searched for relevant English papers. The searched key words were: nanodentistry; nanotechnology; nanoparticles; nanomedicine; nanorobots.
   Conclusion: Studies indicated widespread applications of nanotechnology in different fields of dentistry such as prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Use of nanoparticles as antimicrobial agents in conjunction with other oral hygiene tools such as toothpastes may prevent many oral and dental conditions. Also, application of nanostructures enables faster and easier detection of oral cancers and assessment of the saliva for presence of viruses, proteins or specific markers. Last but not least, Nano capsules, Nano coatings and Nano antibiotics make possible more efficient treatments.

ID PERCEIVED SOURCES; PERCEPTIONS
AB Background: Learning more about the stressful clinics and courses can offer an opportunity to dental educators and administers to increase their awareness of student stressors for offering better educational and academic programs. The purpose of this study is to identify and evaluate the sources of the stress among Qazvin dental students.
   Method and materials: A modified Dental Environmental Stress (DES) questionnaire was distributed among 150 pre-clinical and clinical students. The responses were based on a four-point Lickert scale, not stressful to severely stressful. Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-square analysis was then used to measure and compare the variables.
   Results: A total of 105 undergraduate dental students constituted the study population. 47.7% of these students were female and 52.4% were male. The clinical year students reported higher stress scores. The influence of the preclinical, clinical, and educational environment factors found to be higher on females than males (p<0.05). The most stressful factor in preclinical courses found to be "examination". "Teaching method" and "attitude of the staff" were 2nd and 3rd stressful factors in pre clinics respectively. Dental Anatomy (Practical), Dental Materials, and Dental Anatomy (Theory) were the subjects causing highest level of stress. In clinical years (both in clinics and theoretical courses), stressful factors were: "examinations", " lack of information given", "attitude of the staff" and " teaching method". The most stressful clinical courses identified to be: Endodontic, Surgery, Pediatrics and Radiology. The clinics which students found to be most stressful were Endodontic, Surgery, Pediatrics and Restorative Dentistry.
   Conclusion: The study shows that a proper environment needs to be created for dental students through changes in the curriculum, staff members, and student and staff (academic and administrative) education.

AB Aim: The purpose of this study is to measure changes in bone density caused by chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.
   Materials and methods: This was a cohort study on 72 pre-menopausal patients with breast cancer selected by convenient sampling from public and private hematology and medical oncology clinics in Zahedan during 2012-2015. The bone density was measured before chemotherapy and 6 months after receiving chemotherapy by DXA in femur and vertebrae L1-L4. The results of pre-chemotherapy bone density were compared to post-chemotherapy results (after 6 months) using t-paired test.
   Results: Findings showed that the lumbar BMD was 0.97 +/- 0.11 before receiving chemotherapy and 0.92 +/- 0.11 after 6 months of chemotherapy, which indicates a significant difference (P = < 0.001). moreover, femoral BMD was 0.88 +/- 0.31 before receiving chemotherapy and 0.82 +/- 0.12 after 6 months of chemotherapy, which indicates a significant difference (P= < 0.001).
   Discussion and Conclusion: In this study, bone density generally decreased in the femoral neck and lumbar spine in patients with breast cancer treated with chemotherapy. Furthermore, a relationship was found between the received chemotherapy regimen and the reduced chance of developing bone density.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between dissociative experiences and childhood trauma in adolescent offenders residing in Tehran Correction and Rehabilitation Center. This study was correlational. The study sample consists of 140 adolescent offenders residing in Tehran Correction and Rehabilitation Center. Census-based surveys were performed to select samples. To collect data, Adolescent Dissociative Experience Scale (A-DES) and childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ) were used. In order to analyze the data, in addition to descriptive statistical methods, Pearson correlation test and multiple regression analysis were run in the SPSS statistical software.
   The results showed that there is a strong correlation between childhood trauma and dissociative experiences of the adolescent offenders. In addition, two variables of emotional maltreatment and sexual maltreatment positively predicted the components of imaginary involvement and absorption and depersonalization. Moreover, emotional maltreatment positively predicts the dissociative experience.

AB Introduction: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a fatal viral infection which can lead to nosocomial epidemics with high mortality rates. Two nosocomial transmissions were reported from two hospitals of Mashhad in the last 4 years. The aim of this study was to assess the role of preventive measures on disease prevention among Health Care Workers (HCWs) who are in contact with confirmed CCHF cases.
   Methodology: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in the infectious ward of a referral hospital in North-East of Iran. During 2009 to 2012 about 45 confirmed cases of CCHF were admitted to this hospital. 44 HCWs who had contact with these cases were included in this study. Participants were questioned regarding taking preventive measures including the use of gloves, gown, shield, mask, and shoe cover. Sera samples were also collected 2 months after the last CCHF case admission and were checked for anti-CCHF IgM and IgG.
   Results: All study participants had a history of close contact with confirmed CCHF patients. The contacts were due to daily visits and examination, suction of secretions, intubation, taking blood samples, administering drugs, contact with the patients' clothes, and performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The adherence rate to universal precautions was fairly good and anti-CCHF IgM and IgG results were negative in all subjects.
   Conclusion: The findings of our study further prove that protective measures are highly effective in preventing CCHF transmission in HCWs.

AB Introduction: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one causes of death in the world with 17.5 million deaths in 2012. The purpose of this paper is to determine the most important behavioral and non-behavioral risk factors for CVDs, among patients with heart failures in Kermanshah, in order to design interventional health promotion programs for reducing CVDs risk factors.
   Method and material: In this cross-sectional study 402 participants were selected from cardiovascular patients that hospitalized in Imam Ali Hospital (a referral hospital) for the first time, by consecutive sampling. Data on CVDs behavioral risk factors were collected from a questionnaire that was mainly adopted from the core and the expanded questionnaires of WHO Stepwise approach. Data on total cholesterol, Triglyceride, Fast Blood Sugar Blood Pressure and Body Mass Index were extracted from patient records and to calculate Waist to Hip Ratio index, waist size and hip circumference were measured by interviewers.
   Conclusion: Diet status was main priority for health promotion interventions, and then in order physical inactivity, alcohol consumption and smoking are important for interventions. Obesity, especially abdominal obesity is an important risk factor for CVDs. In these patients glucose impairments were higher than lipid disorders.

DE Personality traits; social support; perceived stress
AB Introduction: the present research has carried out aiming at investigating the relationship between personal traits, social support and perceived stress in women who are volunteered for cosmetic surgery in Elam city.
   Method: this was a cross-sectional study and carried out in the form of descriptive-analytical design on a study population consisting of 100 women who were volunteered for cosmetic surgery and 100 women who were not, in 2016. Random sampling was used in order to select subjects. Due to the nature of the research, the data collection was done through a survey, and to do so, NEO five-factor personality inventory, multidimensional perceived social support, and perceived stress questionnaire was employed. Also, descriptive analysis and t-test were used for one and two independent groups in order to analyze the data.
   Findings: the analyses indicated that there was no significant statistical relationship between different aspects of personality including neuroticism, extroversion, and introversion, desired for new experiences, and loyalty between volunteers and non-volunteers. Moreover, volunteers and non-volunteers did not experience the same perceived social support from their family and there was not any significant relationship between them. However, the social support received from friends and others was more in the case of volunteers for cosmetic surgery and it was statistically significant. According to the results, perceived stress was the same between volunteers and non-volunteers, i. e. there was no significant statistical difference between them.
   Conclusion: The results showed that the average score of non-volunteers was higher than volunteers in different personality aspects, while among different aspects of personality, the average score of agreeableness was different between volunteers and nonvolunteers. The perceived social support from friends and others was more significant among volunteers but perceived stress was the same in both groups and it was not statistically significant.

AB Nowadays, mobile phone is one of the most important tools required for social and professional life; however, in some circumstances it can threaten the health of individuals. This study was aimed to determine the behaviors of the staffs working in steel factories in Ardekan city toward the risks of mobile phone radiation and microbial contaminations. This cross-sectional study, which was conducted in 2014, was aimed to evaluate the staff behaviors toward the risks caused by mobile phone radiation and microbial contamination. The study population was consisted of the staffs working in Steel Plant of Ardekan city. The participants of the study were selected via using cluster sampling method. A researcher made questionnaire was used to collect the data; it had 15 items which were used to assess the behavior. The validity (face and content validity) and reliability of the questionnaire were first confirmed and then it was used for data collection. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 22 statistical software. In this study, a total of 319 employees working in steel factories were evaluated. The mean age of the subjects was 33.04 +/- 8.05 years, the mean work experience of the staff was 8.3 +/- 6.05 years, the mean household size was 2.4 +/- 1.33 persons, and the mean mobile phone bill at the last two months was 50.25 +/- 43.47. The mean score of the staff behavior varied from 0.9 to 2.4. The studied staff had a poor performance in terms of health promoting behaviors. Apparently, to promote staff health it is necessary to utilize educational interventions aimed at increasing staff awareness, changing their attitudes and behavior, and finally changing their lifestyle..5%). Most cases whose reports were unsatisfactory were documented in the first phase of the study (i.e., 9 patients, 90%).
   Conclusion: Cervical screening with Pap smear enables early diagnosis and management of cervical abnormalities and consequently a decrease in the rate of invasive cervical cancers. It is suggested to conduct studies with larger sample sizes to ensure the beneficial effects of cervical screening.

AB The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory ability of liposomal prednisolone in a carrageenan induced acute inflammatory paw edema model. Drug delivery to inflammatory tissue via liposomal nanoparticles may improve therapeutic agents' risk-benefit ratios. prednisolone encapsulated in long-circulating liposomes can inhibit inflammation after administration. The mechanism by which liposomal prednisolone inhibits Production of inflammatory factor. Variable efficacies have been reported for prednisolone drugs as anti-inflammatory treatment. Liposomal prednisolone was administered to male Wistar rats. carrageenan at a concentration of 1% was injected into hind paw of rats. The thickness of paws was measured by caliper within 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the injections to confirm the inflammation. Blood samples were collected immediately after carrageenan injection and also 12 h thereafter. The sera were separated for measurements of interleukin 6 (IL-6). The prednisolone and liposomal prednisolone are efficacious in controlling the paw sizes, as indicators of inflammation; the liposomal prednisolone is remarkably more effective in controlling the inflammation in long term. Both the drug forms were clearly efficient in lowering the IL-6 level. Mostly noteworthy, the liposomal prednisolone was remarkably more efficient in lowering IL-6 levels.

AB Objective: The present research was aimed to compare the effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and metacognition therapy on reduction of symptoms of depression, core self-evaluation and emotion regulation difficulties in pregnant women with depression.
   Methodology: The research was quasi-experimental with pretest-posttest that used control group. In addition, 36 pregnant women referred to maternity ward of Shariati hospital in Tehran were selected using convenience sampling method. Consequently, they were randomly put into three groups including experiment group number one (n=15; under metacognition treatment), experiment group number two (n=15; under cognitive therapy treatment based on mindfulness) and control group (n=15). The participants completed the questionnaires of depression, core self-assessment and emotion regulation difficulties in three stages of basic line, after intervention and following up. The obtained data were analyzed using multivariate repeated measures model.
   Findings: Data analysis using multivariate repeated measures model indicated that there were significant differences in the extent of depression, core self-assessment and emotion regulation in the three mentioned groups. Comparison of means also demonstrated greater effectiveness of cognitive therapy treatment based on mindfulness compared with metacognition treatment.
   Conclusion: The results of the present research indicated that cognitive therapy treatment based on mindfulness can have a significant impact on improvement of emotional disorders during pregnancy and among pregnant women with depression. On other words, it could be a preferred method for improvement of depression during pregnancy.

AB Heavy metals are unwanted pollutants introduced directly and indirectly into the environment and ecological currents through the discharge of industrial wastewaters. Many of them, like hexavalent chromium, easily enter biological organs resulting in acute toxicity and damage to kidney, liver, and lung due to their maximum oxidation state in comparison with their other compounds. On the other hand, they incur irrecoverable effects on the environment and ecosystems. Accordingly, human beings need processes and technologies to lessen the danger of these pollutants; in order to remove chromium from aquatic environments, various methods including physical, chemical, and biological methods have been important. Among them, reverse osmosis, ion exchange, electro dialysis, chemical deposition, and adsorption are popular. In practice, in order to apply each of the mentioned treatment methods, preliminary studies for applicability, the required expertise, and the costs of construction and operation are necessary.

AB Introduction: To investigate the effects of silencing NET-1 (neuroepithelial cell transforming gene-1) and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) using DGT siRNA (Dual genes targeting small interfering ribonucleic acid) on the biological behavior of lung cancer cell in vivo.
   Materials and methods: In this study, 12 nude mice models bearing human lung cancer xenografts were built by injecting A549 lung cancer cell. The targeting NET-I, VEGF siRNA and DGT siRNA embedded by cationic liposome were injected to the xenograft tumor when its volume reached to 100mm3. The expressions of NET-1 and VEGF gene in xenograft tumor were detected by immunohistochemistry. Additionally, proliferation and microvessel density of xenograft tumors were evaluated by detecting the expression of Ki-67 and CD34 respectively.
   Results: Nude mice models bearing xenograft tumor were successfully built. In dual siRNA group, compared with single NET-1 or VEGF siRNAs group, the volume of xenograft tumor was smaller; the expressions of NET-1 and VEGF was lower; the expression of Ki-67 and CD34 was lower as well (P<0.05).
   Conclusions: Dual-target genes silencing could achieve better inhibitory effects on the proliferation and the angiogenesis of lung xenograft tumor.

AB Introduction: Intensive care unit (ICU) hospital infections are a global problem concerning the whole world. Sensitivity and specificity of parameters such as CRP (C-reactive protein), erythrocyte sedimentation rate and WBC (white blood cell), which are among the classical markers of systemic inflammation, were reported to have limited benefit in patients with these types of bacterial infections. PCT (procalcitonin) has been a focus of interest as a specific and early marker in systemic inflammation, sepsis and infections especially in recent years. In this study, we aimed to evaluate potential usability of PCT in distinction of systemic and localized bacterial infections in patients who are followed up in ICU and to compare CRP, WBC and MPV (mean platelet volume) values in patients with systemic and localized bacterial infections.
   Materials and methods: Totally 52 patients who were followed in Adult ICU of our hospital were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of patients with growth in blood culture and systemic bacterial infection clinic. Group 2 consisted of patients with growth in phlegm, tracheal aspirate, wound and urine culture without growth in blood culture. Age, gender growth region and growing microorganisms, simultaneously checked CRP, PCT, WBC, MPV values were recorded in follow-up form.
   Results: The study showed that PCT value was significantly high in systemic infections, while other parameters did not show a significant difference between the two groups. Furthermore, Acinetobacter baumannii was found to be the most common agent.
   Conclusion: Our study suggests that PCT value has a more valuable potential than other standard infection parameters in distinction of systemic infection and localized bacterial infection in patients who are followed in ICU. However, we believe that more comprehensive studies with a larger sampling can guide the clinicians for early diagnosis and treatment.

AB Introduction: Tularemia is a zoonotic disease of the northern hemisphere including Turkey. Here we describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics and response to treatment of patients with oropharyngeal tularemia caused by F. tularensis. subsp.holarctica.
   Materials and methods: Datawere collected retrospectively from patients' files. Serum, throat swabs and lymph node aspirates were obtained from suspected patients. The diagnosis was confirmed by a single titer of IgG >= 1 : 160 or a seroconversion or detection of F.tularensis nucleic acid or isolation of it in a clinical specimen.
   Results: All the patients had cervical or submandibular lymphadenopathy and malaise at admission. Lymphadenopathy was the single finding in 86.36% of patients. Microagglutination test was positive for F.tularensis subsp. holarcticain 95.45% of patients, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of drained material was positive in 22.72% of patients but cultures were negative. Treatment delay and therapeutic failure was seen in 90.90% and 45.45% of the patients respectively. We found statistically significant relationship between treatment delay and therapeutic failure (P= 0.0005).
   Discussion: Tularemia should be suspected whenever severe pharyngitis or tonsillitis and lymphadenophaties is unresponsive to beta-lactam or macrolides in an endemic area. As treatment delay is an important risk factor for therapeutic failure, treatment should be started as soon as tularemia is suspected.

AB Aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of intravaginal application of seminal plasma after follicle aspiration on clinical pregnancy rates after IVF-ET.
   Material and methods: This investigation is a single - blinded randomized clinical trialon 266 patients undergoing IVF-ET that were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were randomly assigned to interventionin the seminal plasma group (SP) (n=133) andculture medium (placebo) as a control group (n=133) by using Permuted Balanced Block Randomization 2cc of Fresh seminal plasma from the patient's partner or culture medium (placebo) were injected in the Vaginal vault just after follicle aspiration. The main outcome measured was clinical pregnancy rate.
   Results: Comparing the study group to controls, no significant differences were found regarding age, AMH, number of ova retrieved, and number of cleaving embryos. Comparable mean number of embryos was transferred in both groups. 49 clinical pregnancies were achieved. The clinical pregnancy rate was 20 % and 17.3 % for the study and control groups, respectively (p=ns).
   Conclusion: Our data do not confirm the theory of seminal plasma having the potential to increase pregnancy rate. The data should be confirmed by larger studies and more seminal plasmaintravaginal insemination at the time of embryo transfer.

AB Introduction: Ripening of the cervix and uterine contractions are two basic factors of a successful delivery. Lack of ripening of the cervix is considered to be one of the problems of delivery. Thus, the present research was designed to determine the effect of oral evening primrose capsules on the ripening of cervix in nulliparous women.
   Materials and methods: This research has been conducted with the triple-blind randomized trial method on 80 nulliparous women in the 40th week of pregnancy (6th day + 40 weeks) visiting the prenatal clinic Prenatal clinic Shahid Akbarabadi educational and medical center of Iran University of Medical Sciences in 2015. Samples were divided into two equal groups of medicine and placebo with the randomized allocation method. Each of the participants took a bottle containing 14 1000mg oral evening primrose capsules (2 capsules per day, each 12 twelve hours for a week) or the placebo containing 14 1000mg oral capsules of paraffin in similar bottles. Data collecting tools include: demographic specifications questionnaire and the form of the records of the examinations. Data was analyzed through statistical tests and SPSS software version 16 using descriptive inferential statistic.
   Findings: Similarity of the two groups in terms of individual specifications and Bishop Score before the intervention were reviewed in the two groups and no significant statistical difference was seen between the two groups. The mean of the Bishop score for those who had taken 10 or more capsules after the intervention did not show a statistically significant difference (p=0.110).
   Conclusion: Consumption of evening primrose did not show a considerable improvement in the score. It is recommended to do more comparative studies in this field in later weeks of pregnancy due to the conflicts of the studies.

TI EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EMPOWERMENT-BASED EDUCATION ON
   EMPOWERMENT AND ANXIETY IN NULLIPAROUS WOMEN
SO ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA
LA English
DT Article
DE Empowerment-based education; empowerment; anxiety; nulliparous pregnant
   women
AB Background: Anxiety is the most common mental disorder during pregnancy which increases the risk of maternal postpartum depression and anxiety; According to investigations, pregnant women hypothesized that anxiety is a common factor that will improve spontaneously; they are not aware of its side effects on the fetus, baby, and pregnancy outcome, as a whole. Therefore, creating the opportunities of independence through interacting with environment and other people and gaining sustainable mental energy can empower this defect and turn pregnancy into something pleasant. As a result, present study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of empowerment-based education on empowerment and anxiety in nulliparous women.
   Methods: This clinical trial survey was performed on 70 nulliparous women of 20-24 weeks. Subjects were divided into two control and experimental groups of 35 members through random sampling. Both groups completed the demographic questionnaire, Pregnant Women Empowerment questionnaire, and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) before intervention. Pregnant Women Empowerment questionnaire and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was completed again immediately and eight weeks after intervention by both groups. Data were analyzed by t test and Fisher's exact test through SPSS version 16. Significance level of 0.05 was considered.
   Results: There were no significant differences between control and experimental groups, with whole demographic variables. The results showed that the mean and standard deviation of anxiety in two groups of experimental and control before intervention were 16.78 +/- 90.91 and 16.29 +/- 89.14 which implies no significant difference (P>0.05); however, post-intervention data analysis immediately and eight weeks after intervention showed a significant difference between two groups (P<0001). Mean and standard deviation of empowerment before the intervention in control and experimental groups, respectively, were 6.83 +/- 74.77 and 7.76 +/- 76.80 in which no statistically significant difference between two groups was observed (P>0.05); however, post-intervention data analysis immediately and eight weeks after intervention showed a significant difference between two groups. (P<0001)
   Conclusion: Empowerment-based education reduces the level of anxiety and increases empowerment of women during pregnancy; since this method is cheap, simple, and risk-free, it is highly recommended for nulliparous women.

AB Considering the importance of congenital heart diseases (CHD) from public health standpoint and related predisposing risk factors such as genetic and environmental factors, this study aimed to investigate the frequency of different forms of CHD and to study possible predisposing risk factors in patients admitted to a university hospital in, Kermanshah, Iran. In this retrospective study, medical charts of 774 patients with diagnosis of CHD admitted to our university hospital from April 2002 to March 2012 were reviewed. The required data were collected and analyzed. About 51.9% of the patients were male and 63.8% of patients had consanguineous parents. In 37.4% of the cases, the mother reported taking at least a medication during the pregnancy. The most common CHDs were in order atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), tetralogy of Fallot, patent ductu srterios us (PDA), aortic valve stenos is, and coarctation of the aorta. This study shows more attention to the congenital heart diseases, the predisposing genetic role of these diseases and also family marriages is better not to be done. It is recommended that further studies will be undertaken with larger samples.

AB Introduction: The best way of treatment in tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), considering surgical approach and age of patient, is not still apparent. In recent years, trans-atrial, trans-pulmonary, and primary repair have gained acceptance in younger patients.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the outcomes of surgeries performed for patients with TOF in Kermanshah, Iran in mid-and long-term follow-ups.
   Methods: A total of 92 patients with TOF who underwent surgery between 1995 and 2010 were included. The required data were extracted from their medical records. Mean age of the subjects at the time of surgery was 7.3 years. Thirty-four patients (36.95%) were younger than five years, 41 subjects (45.05%) aged between five and ten years old and 17 patients (18.47%) were older than 10 years.
   Results: Thirty-seven patients required shunt placement before the corrective surgery, mainly due to complex anatomy of the defect. Complete repair surgery was achieved via trans-atrial approach in 25 patients and via transatrial-transpulmonary approach in 30 patients. In very young patients, due to stenosis of pulmonary valve, trans-annular patch was required. All patients after receiving treatments had sinus rhythm. Right bundle branch block (RBBB) was seen in 91 patients after surgery. Mean hospitalization duration was 12 days. Twenty-six patients (29.3%) required re-operation which included pulmonary insufficiency (14 cases), tricuspid regurgitation (6 cases), pulmonary stenosis (3 cases), and ventricular septal defect in 2 subjects. There were early death in 13 subjects and late death in seven patients.
   Conclusion: Surgical correction of TOF at younger age did not raise mortality rate. The surgical technique was chosen considering the anatomy of the right ventricular outflow and applying this variable in choosing the method of surgery, we were able to achieve better outcomes.

ID POPULATION; INFECTION; WORLDWIDE; LESIONS; CANCER
AB Background: Global estimates indicate that cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women following breast cancer. Therefore, screening for cervical cancer is considered an effective method in early diagnosis and treatment of this condition. Here, we studied screening tests results to determine the frequency of abnormal cervical cytologic findings.
   Methods: This study had two phases. The first phase was conducted from March 2007 to March 2008 (400 subjects). The second phase lasted from March 2011 to March 2012 (208 subjects). All infertile women (either primary causes or secondary ones) who presented to our university infertility clinic to receive treatments were included.
   Results: Cervical cytology reports were unsatisfactory in 10 subjects (1.7%) and abnormal in three patients (0.5%). Most cases whose reports were unsatisfactory were documented in the first phase of the study (i.e., 9 patients, 90%).
   Conclusion: Cervical screening with Pap smear enables early diagnosis and management of cervical abnormalities and consequently a decrease in the rate of invasive cervical cancers. It is suggested to conduct studies with larger sample sizes to ensure the beneficial effects of cervical screening.

AB Background: Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is the first line treatment in couples with male factor sub fertility or unexplained infertility. The objective of this study was to investigate sperm preparation with three methods of sperm gradient procedure (P50), bilayer gradient (P 40-80), and swim-up method for IUI in couples with male factor sub fertility(mild form, 5-15 million sperm per mL) or unexplained infertility.
   Methods: A total number of 153 infertile couples underwent 223 therapeutic cycles. There were 103 couples (68%) with unexplained infertility and 50 couples (32%) with mild male factor sub fertility. Sperm parameters including concentration, morphology, motility, and pregnancy rate were determined in each group before and after sperm preparation.
   Results: In unexplained infertility group, differences in sperm motility and morphology before and after P 40-80 preparation method were 67.1 (3.8) and 18 (1.1), respectively. This difference was significantly higher compared to the other two methods. The rate of pregnancy was also significantly higher (18%) in P 40-80 group compared to the other groups. In contrast, in mild male factor sub fertility group, no significant difference was observed between the three sperm preparation methods.

AB Background: Nowadays, progress in assisted reproductive technology (ART) has enabled the clinicians to treat infertility significantly. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of ART on pregnancy outcome among infertile women who presented to the Infertility Center of Motazedi Hospital in Kermanshah, Iran.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, infertile women who received ART such as intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection embryo transfer (ICSI-ET) or in vitro fertilization (IVF) were included. Thirty-three patients received IVF. Pregnancy outcomes were determined. The data were entered into a checklist and were analyzed using SPSS software (ver. 18.0).
   Results: Mean (SD) age of the patients was 32.6 (5.7) years. Age range was 18-43 years. Male factor was diagnosed as the cause of infertility in 14 cases (42%), tubal factors in 4 cases (12.1%), and anovulation in 2 cases (6.1%) were the major causes of infertility. In one patient (3%), both female and male factors were recognized as the cause of infertility. Unexplained infertility was present in 11 cases (33.3%). No adverse maternal or fetal effect was detected during pregnancy.
   Conclusion: ART was not associated with higher maternal adverse effects compared to natural pregnancy.

AB Backgrund: The objective of this research was to design a model medical education based on grounded theory, so the educational system which utilizes the above processes can function more consciously, purposefully and more professionally.
   Methods: The research was conducted using the exploratory mixed method. This is a two-phased method; the first phase is to design a model of qualitative grounded theory, and in the second phase as a means of validation of the designed model, a survey method was used. To collect information during the first phase of the research, a multistep open interview, taking notes from texts, and scientific documents were used, while for the second phase a questionnaire with measured reliability and validity was employed. To analyze the data in the first phase, open, axial, and selective coding methods were used, while in the second phase, descriptive statistics (frequency, mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistics was used.
   Results: The research findings in the first phase resulted in the model design for medical education. This model is composed of 4 stages with 6 categories. These main categories contain 33 sub-categories. According to experts, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, it can be said that 8% of the total sample found the model of medical education to be non-desirable, 55% relatively desirable, and 33% found the evaluation to be desirable.
   Conclusion: Therefore, the stated model can be an effective medical education, and will be responsive to the needs of educational systems.

AB Background and objectives: Community Re-Entry Program is one of the programs related to social and independent living skills that provides patients with chronic mental disorders with some information and skills. The present study aimed to assess the effect of Community Re-Entry Program on social function of patients with chronic mental disorders.
   Methods: In this study, 40 patients with chronic mental disorders referring to outpatient rehabilitation centers of Hamadan, Iran were randomly divided into an intervention (N=20) and a control (N=20) group. The intervention group received community rehabilitation program in 16 60-90-minute educational sessions held twice a week for two months. The control group, on the other hand, took part in the center's routine occupational therapy. Both groups were evaluated using Assessment of Communication and Interaction Skills (ACIS) questionnaire before and after the intervention.
   Results: The results showed a significant change in physicality (P<0.02), information exchange (P<0.02), and total score of ACIS questionnaire (P<0.01) in the intervention group compared to the control group after the intervention. However, no significant difference was found between the two groups concerning relations (P<0.09).
   Conclusion: The results showed that Community Re-Entry Program played an important role in improving social function among patients with chronic mental disorders. Yet, future studies are required to assess the long-term clinical effects of this program

DE Conformal Radiotherapy; Dosimetry; Modified Radical Mastectomy of Breast
   Cancer
AB In order to prolong the survival of patients with breast cancer and improve quality of life, this study compared the dosimetry difference of two conformal radiotherapies of breast cancer: dual target and single target radiotherapy, which provide a scientific reference for follow-up treatment. 1200 patients who underwent modified radical mastectomy (stage II and Stage III and with postoperative radiotherapy indications) treated in 10 tumor hospitals from January 2014 to June 2615 were studied, and a comprehensive retrospective analysis of treatment data was conducted. Single target area and dual target radiotherapy Plans were developed for all patients according to their individual circumstances. In the course of the study, a thorough comparative analysis was made on target dose distribution, affected side lung, double lung, ipsilateral humeral head, and thyroid dose volume of the two plans. There was no significant difference (P>0.05) in dose distribution between the two methods based on comparative analysis of single target plan and dual target plan, and there was obvious similarity (P>0.05) in normal lung dose volume. However, based on measurement and comparison oftityroid ipsilateral humeral head dose volume, it was found that dual target plan is significantly lower, than single target plan, and the difference is statistically significant: P<0.05. Therefore, this study fully confirms that in comparison of breast cancer dual target and single target radiotherapy plans, there is no significant difference in target area dose distribution and normal lung tissue protection,,but the former enjoys an obvious advantage in protection of thyroid and humeral head. In the course of treatment, physicians need to choose a reasonable radiotherapy plan according to patient's actual conditions.

AB Aerobics have gained wide development in recent years as an important part of current sports events. In the process of aerobics exercise, athletes are prone to ankle joint injury. In order to analyze the causes of ankle joint injury in aerobics exercise and estimate the treatment effect of applying RICE treatment, the author selected 400 patients with ankle joint injury after aerobics from August 2014 to December 2015. Causes of ankle joint injury of aerobics athletes were analyzed, and the effect of applying RICE treatment was observed. Final study results show that ankle joint injury among aerobics athletes is mainly due to inattention, poor psychological attitude; landing instability, training with injury, etc. Application of RICE for patients can provide a_significdnt treatment effect and pro MOO recovery. Having certain clinical value, it is worth being popularized and applied in future clinical treatment.

AB Background and purpose: Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus can cause serious infections in ICU patients. Enterococci are the major prevalent reasons of hospital infections especially in ICU. In patients, the most prevalent places of infection are: urinary tract, wounds, bilious system and blood. Enterococcus may create meningitis and sepsis in infants and endocarditis in adults. Current study was done with the purpose of evaluating the prevalence amount of colonialization with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus in hospitalized patients in ICU sections of hospitals dependent on medical sciences university of Zanjan in 2015.
   Methodology: this research is a descriptive study of sectional kind. The research population included 140 hospitalized patients in the special care sectors dependent on medical sciences university of Zanjan that at least 72 hours elapsed since their hospitalization time. The samples were selected by random sampling method with rectal swab (excrement culture) over six months. The amount of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus was considered with Diffusion Disk Method according to the world standard and the results were evaluated according to CLSI instruction and the data were analyzed by using of frequency distribution tables and also Chisquare tests, T-TEST, Mann-Whitney Test.
   Findings: From among 140 enterococci isolated from patients, excrement in hospital (72.1%), 101 enterococci were diagnosed with Disk Diffusion Method to the resistant vancomycin that our study indicates at least 72.1% of hospitalized patients in ICU are carrier of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. In this study, no meaningful relation was found between gender, hospitalization time period, and also discharge or death of patients, previous consumption of antibiotic, digestive manipulation and Foley catheter insertion and prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. But meaningful relation was found between high age and prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (P=0.05).
   Conclusion: With regard to the high prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (72.1%), it is suggested that more studies to be accomplished in the field of evaluation of new antibiotics that nowadays are introduced for treating the enterococcus infections.

ID QUALITY; MEDICINE
AB Objective: Considering the importance and specific situation of emergency ward in providing medical care and reducing mortality rates, This study is conducted to investigate the changes of national indices of the hospitals of Kermanshah province during2012 to 2015.
   Materials and methods: This study was a longitudinal study to evaluate changes in performance indices of hospitals in Kermanshah province during 2012 to 2015. The data were collected from the emergency ward as the designed list and they have been applied into SPSS software v.16. Method of repeated measures has been utilized to evaluate normal indices and the Friedman nonparametric test has been applied for abnormal indices
   Results: The results showed that the difference of the index of percentage settled patients within 6 hours and the variations for the index of failed CPR percentage between public and private hospitals were significant. Also there were no significant mean variations of any indices between academic hospitals and non-academic hospitals over time. The average deviation for time of triage level 1 had a significant difference in civilian and military hospitals and lower mean time of triage level 5 was statistically significant in the hospitals of Kermanshah city in comparison with other province's cities.
   Conclusion: The deviations for the index of settled patient's percentage within 6 hours were significant, and the higher value of this index for winter and spring implies the effect of season on these deviations at present study. The main powers and facilities of emergency ward should be properly managed for winter and spring, because the personnel's working shifts are reduced by the holidays of New Persian Year.

TI GIANT LIPOMATOUS TUMORS OF THE THIGH
SO ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA
LA English
DT Article
DE Lipoma; Liposarcoma; Magnetic resonance imaging; Biopsy
ID LIPOSARCOMAS
AB Introduction: Lipomas are the most common soft tissue tumors and they can occur anywhere in the body. They may rarely become to giant dimensions and they are called as "giant lipomas". Giant lipomas are rare and they may also resemble to malignant soft tissue tumors. In this case they should be differentiated especially from liposarcomas. In this study we evaluated the treatment results of lipomatous tumors (giant lipomas and liposar comas) of the thigh with their clinical, radiological, and histopathological features.
   Materials and methods: Twelve patients with giant lipomatous tumor on thigh who underwent surgical excision were included to the study. Patients were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) preoperatively. To rule out distant metastasis, thoracic and abdominal computed tomography (CT) were performed. Initially, incisional biopsy was performed, and according to the histopathological results, these giant lipomatous tumors were surgically excised.
   Results: There were 6 males and 6 females with an average age of 55,6 years. Histopathological examinations revealed the lesions to be giant lipomas in nine patients, and liposarcomas in the remaining three patients. Because of the dimensions or weight of the lipomas, they were accepted as "giant lipomas". The heaviest lipoma was 1976 g. After surgical excision patients were followed up with an average of 24,3 months. During the follow up of the patients, local recurrences and distant metastasis were not observed.
   Conclusion: Giant lipomas are rarely seen tumors. Differential diagnosis of giant lipoma and liposarcoma may cause difficulties. In the presence of suspicion, biopsy should be performed. Surgical treatment modality also should be planned according to the histopathological results. Marginal surgical excision is adequate for giant lipomas, but as wide as possible surgical excision with negative surgical margins should be performed for liposarcomas to reduce the rate of local recurrences.

AB Introduction: Diabetic nephropathy (DN), a microvascular complication associated with diabetes mellitus (DM), manifests in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and may lead to end-stage renal failure. Recent studies have reported that the monocyte/ high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (MHR) serves as an inflammatory marker. The purpose of this study is to analyze the prognostic value of the MHR in DN patients.
   Material and methods: The medical records of type 2 DM patients who received follow-up care at the internal medicine clinic were examined, and the data of all patients who had undergone estimation of 24-hour UAE were recorded. These patients were separated into 3 groups on the basis of the UAE levels and the biochemical data and the MHR were compared between the groups.
   Results: The serum creatinine (p = 0.008), 24-hour UAE (p < 0.001), and MHR (p = 0.005) were all significantly different between the groups. The MHR was positively correlated to the 24-hour UAE (p = 0.007) and negatively correlated to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (p = 0.023).
   Conclusion: The MHR can be an inexpensive, accessible, and useful early prognostic marker in diabetic nephropathy patients.

AB Objective: The cMET receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) regulate many signaling pathways involved in proliferation and cell motility, invasion and angiogenesis. Deregulation of HGF/cMET system by different biological mechanisms may contribute to the minor development in many types of cancers. Therefore, the present study was performed to investigate clinical significance of serum patterns of both HGF and cMET in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.
   Materials and methods: One hundred and three CRC patients were enrolled in this study. Serum HGF and cMET levels were measured by the solid-phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Age- and sex-matched 30 healthy control patients were included in the analysis.
   Results: The median age of the patients was 60 years old, range 24 to 84 years. Most of the tumor localization areas were colon (n = 57, 55%). Median follow-up time was 14 months. While thirty-one patients (30 %) experienced disease progression, twenty-three of the remaining patients (22 %) died because of the disease. The estimated 2-year overall (OS) and 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates for the whole patient groups were 70.1 % (95% confidence interval (CI) = 57.2-83.0) and 233 % (95% CI = 82-38.4), respectively. The baseline median serum HGF and cMET levels were significantly higher in metastatic CRC patients than in the healthy control group (p<0.001). Furthermore, worse performance status and metastatic disease were associated with higher serum HGF concentrations all patients with CRC (p=0.03 and p=0.03, respectively). Clinical variables including metastatic disease, greater pathologic tumor status, and colonic site were found to be correlated with higher serum cMET concentrations all patients with CRC (p=0.01, p=0.05, and p=0.04, respectively). A correlation was determined between HGF and cMET levels in metastatic CRC patients (rs=0.286, n=47, and p=0.05), (Spearman's correlation). Our study results did not show a statistically significant serum HGF and cMET concentrations regarding PFS and OS.
   Conclusion: Serum levels of HGF and cMET may be diagnostic markers in CRC patients. However; their predictive and prognostic values were not determined.

AB Introduction: Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States among both men and women. Macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha [MIP-1 alpha/CC-chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3)] is a small chemotactic protein detected in several kinds of tumor tissue samples and functions as a key regulator of cancer progression. This study aimed to investigate the serum MIP-1 alpha/CCL3 levels in pacreatic adenocarcinoma (PA).
   Materials and methods: Thirty-three patients with PA were investigated. Serum MIP1-alpha/CCL3 levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Age and sex matched 30 healthy controls were included in the analysis.
   Results: The median age at diagnosis was 59 years, range 32-84 years; 20 (61%) patients were men. The tumor was located in the head of the pancreas in 21 (63%) patients. The most common metastatic site was the liver in the 23 patients with metastasis (n= 19, 83%). The median follow-up time was 26.0 weeks (range: 1.0-184.0 weeks). At the end of the observation period, thirty-two patients (97%) were dead. Thirty-nine percent of 23 metastatic patients who received palliative chemotherapy (CTx) were CTx-responsive. The median overall survival of all the patients was 41.3 +/- 8.3 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI]= 5-58 weeks). The baseline serum MIP1-alpha/CCL3 levels were significantly higher in patients with PA than in the control group (p< 0.001). Serum MIP1-alpha/CCL3 levels were significantly higher in the older patients(p= 0.03). Conversely, serum MIP1-alpha/CCL3 concentration had no prognostic role on survival (p= 0.68).
   Conclusion: Serum levels of MIP1-alpha/CCL3 may have a good diagnostic role in PA. However, serum MIP1-alpha/CCL3 concentrations were not associated with prognosis and survival.

AB Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that manifests itself with joint swelling and pain. Although alexithymia is more commonly seen in painful rheumatic conditions such as RA, there is limited clinical data about the relations with other psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety and their impact on quality of life. We aimed to assess the level of alexithymia, depression and anxiety and their effects on quality of life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
   Materials and methods: A hundred forty-eight patients with RA and 100 healthy subjects were included in the study. After physical examination of the patients, Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were performed to determine levels of alexithymia depression and anxiety, respectively. The World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale Abbreviated Version (WHOQoL-BREF) was used to assess the quality of life. Disease Activity Score Calculator for Rheumatoid Arthritis-28 (DAS-28) was performed to evaluate disease activity.
   Results: The prevalence of alexithymia was 31.1% in patients with RA. Alexithymia was statistically significantly higher in the RA than the control group (p< 0.05). 41.9% (n= 62) of the patients with RA were diagnosed with depression. 20.9% (n= 31) of the patients had severe anxiety symptoms. Although there was no statistically significant difference between alexithymia and depression scores, disease activity scores (p> 0.05) in patient with RA. The anxiety scores were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in patients with RA. RA patients manifested poorer scores in all domains of WHOQoL-BREF than the control subjects (p< 0.05).
   Conclusion: In this clinical trial it has been demonstrated that regardless of disease activity, alexithymia, symptoms of depression and anxiety are more commonly seen in RA patients that can negatively affect the quality of life. Further studies are needed to confirm this association.

AB Introduction: Clinical deterioration and death among patients with dyspnea are often preceded by detri-mental changes in physiological parameters. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the aggregate weighted track and trigger system Early warning score (EWS) can be used as a simple observational tool to identify patients at risk and predict treatment success in a population of patients with dyspnea.
   Materials and methods: Adult patients who applied to the emergency service with dyspnea complaints and who were taken in for monitoring were included in this prospective and empirical study.
   Pulse, systolic blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and neurologi-cal status at the time of arrival, 15minutes later and 30 minutes later were used for EWS cal-culation. Patients were divided into four score categories based on their EWS. The patients were compared with regard to hospitalization, discharge and response to the treatment.
   Results: T91 patients were included in the study. The EWS values of dyspnea patients calculated for the 15th and 30th minutes were observed to be statistically significant as a result of an evaluation with regard to hospitalization and discharge (p= 0.015, p= 0.001). It was determined that the oxygen saturation values measured on the 15th and 30th minutes were important for giving the hospitalization decision (p= 0.048, p= 0.009). Improvement in the physiological parameters measured at the time of arrival, 15minutes later and 30 minutes later were determined to be significant for the evaluation of the response to the treatment.
   Conclusions: In this study, it was put forth that the difference between the EWS value at the time of arrival, 15minutes later and 30 minutes later is an early indicator for the result and success of the treatment. This can ease making clinical decisions and shorten the time that patients stay at the emergency service by prioritizing risky patients.

AB Introduction: Early identification of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) colonization by screening patients is necessary in tends of preventing spread and development of infection. The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of VRE using and real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and to compare the results and costs.
   Materials and methods: Patients in the risk group attending our hospital and planned for treatment with hospitalization were included. Two rectal swab specimens were taken. One swab specimen was inoculated into enterococci broth for CCSM. Resistant gene investigation was performed with the other specimen by using RT-PCR. The costs of the two methods were then compared.
   Results: VRE were detected in 75 (6.63%) of the 1130 patients screened using the two methods. Resistance gene was determined in 69 (6.1%) patients using RT-PCR and 32 (2.8%) with CCSM. RT-PCR results were negative in 6 patients with VRE growth determined using CCSM. VRE was detected with CCSM in all 26 patients in whom vanA genotype VRE were determined using RT-PCR, but no growth was determined with CCSM in any of the 43 patients in whom vanB genotype VRE were detected. Results obtained in 3 days using CCSM and within 4 hours using RT-PCR. Costs were 58 $ with CCSM and 46 $ with RT-PCR.
   Conclusion: VRE colonization being detected faster with RT-PCR than CCSM. When the costs in isolation of patients until VRE screening test results emerged were compared, VRE screening with RT-PCR was cost-effective. RT-PCR was markedly superior to CCSM in determining VanB type resistance. Due to the late results from CCSM and its failure to detect VanB type resistance, we think that RT-PCR can be an alternative to CCSM or that the two techniques can usefully be combined depending on the hospital conditions.

AB Introduction: Arbitrarily Primed-Polymerase Chain Reaction (AP-PCR) and Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) are widely used genotyping methods for investigating outbreaks of infections. The aim of this research is to compare AP-PCR with PFGE, which is known as the gold standard method, and to determine if AP-PCR is suitable for use in outbreaks.
   Materials and methods: Between 2001 and 2009, 664 isolated vancomycin resistant enterococcus (VRE) strains were determined at the Bacteriology Laboratory, Department of Medical Microbiology. During nine years study 5 peak periods were identified. In each peak period of 3 months, 83 VRE strains were selected from the 664 for this research. For all isolates a comparison of AP-PCR and PFGE using 83 VRE strains was performed.
   Results: Enterococcus faecium was found to be the dominant species in all VRE isolated from hospitalized patients. 83 strains of E. faecium were included in the study, which were isolated from 5 different possible epidemic periods over 9 years. 15 different clonal strains were collected using the AP-PCR method and 11 using PFGE.
   Conclusion: AP-PCR was found to be repeatable and had a better separation power than PFGE. FPGE though is a simpler, cheaper and faster method and can be used for VRE epidemics as an alternative method. In future epidemiological outbreaks the comparative molecular methods are more reliable than a single method.

AB Introduction: Nowadays, referrals to emergency departments due to intoxication remain to be important in terms of mortality and morbidity. Among these intoxications, cases with cardiac involvement should be closely monitored. Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) is considered as a sensitive marker of cardiac dysfunction at recent years measurement of BNP levels provides considerable information about cardiac functions in a short time. In the present study, it is aimed to evaluate the relationship between blood Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) level and severity of intoxication in order to identify cardiac dysfunction caused by intoxication with cardiotoxic agents.
   Material and methods: Patients who arrived to adult emergency departments of two public hospitals due to poisoning caused by tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), beta blockers and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were recruited to the study. Taken drugs time, vital signs, and electrocardiograms were recorded. Blood BNP was analyzed within 2 hours after arrival to emergency department in order to determine BNP level.
   Results: 44 patients included in the study. When patients with BNP levels above or below the cut-off value were compared, it was found that hypotension rate was significantly higher and need for intensive care unit admission was significantly greater in patients with high BNP levels. When patients were considered regarding their ECG, no statistically significant relationship was found between BNP level and PR or QTc interval. However, a significant prolongation was detected in QRS interval in patients with high BNP levels, which is an indicator of ventricle contraction.
   Discussion and conclusion: Cardiotoxic drugs intoxication, hypotension and widening in QRS on ECG were found in patients with high blood BNP levels. In addition, intensive care unit admission ratio was found higher in patients with BNP level was above cut-off value. Regarding all these data, measurement of blood BNP level could be used for evaluation of cardiovascular toxicity risk.

AB Objective: To review the clinical characteristics, genetic features and treatments of the previously reported cases of Behcet's disease and ankylosing spondylitis with additional one case presentation.
   Method: Pubmed, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were interrogated.
   Results: A total of 23 cases with coexistence of Behcet's disease and ankylosing spondylitis were found and afterwards reviewed. The majority of them involved male subjects (82.6%). All patients had mucocutaneous lesions and sacroiliitis, 54.5% of all patients had eye involvement, 68.4% had positive pathergy test, 75% had peripheral arthritis and 55.6% of patients developed ankylosing spondylitis after Behcet's disease. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors were used in six cases. HLA-B51 was positive in 57.1% and HLA-B27 in 59.1% of all cases.
   Conclusion: Even though Behcet's disease has some clinical and genetic features in common with spondyloarthritis, there remains no sufficient evidence that phenotypes of these shared features are identical or these features are traced to a similar pathogenesis. By taking into account all previously reported cases and our presented case, we suggest that ankylosing spondylitis should be considered in differential diagnosis as a coexisting condition when a Behcet's disease patient with low back pain is being examined.

AB Introduction: Osteoporosis is the most frequently seen metabolic bone disease. Smoking has long been defined as a changeable risk factor in life style for both bone loss and fractures. This study is aimed to compare of the bone turnover markers between smoker and non-smoker male.
   Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional and descriptive study, 85 smoker males were allocated to the case group, while 85 non-smoker males were allocated to the control group. Osteocalcin (OC) and osteoprotogerin (OPG) analyzed among bone formation parameters, while RANKL (Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand) and CTX (C-terminal telopeptide) were studied among the bone destruction parameters alongside with TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone), Ca (Calcium), P (Phosphorus), PTH (Parathyroid Hormone), ALP(Alkaline Phosphatase), TT (Total Testosterone), and vitamin D parameters that affect bone mineral density.
   Results: It was found that the smoker group's CTX level (50.30+/-26.97 ng/ml) was statistically significant lower than that of the non-smoker group (65.10+/-42.41 ng/ml. (p=0.007) The average serum PTH level of the smoker and non-smoker groups were 23.75+/-9.88 pg/ml and 31.35+/-13.15 pg/ml respectively and the related average of the non-smoker group was statistically higher than that of the smoker group (p=0.000). It was found that the smoker group's vitamin D (16.75+/-8.73 ng/ml) was statistically significant lower than that of the non-smoker group (19.50+/-8.97 ng/ml (p=0.044).
   Conclusions: The study supports the fact that one of the risk factors for osteoporosis is smoking and it negatively affects bone formation as well. It should be noted that osteoporosis is a significant health issue not only for older men but also for middle-aged male smokers and the necessary support for smoking cessation should be offered.

AB Introduction: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is common throughout the world. Ghrelin and leptin peptides play a crucial role in the homeostasis of the human body. Previously, some studies showed that H. pylori colonization had been associated with circulating leptin and ghrelin levels, but the certain relationship is still uncertain. The goal of this study is to determine the effects of H. pylori infection on serum ghrelin and leptin levels and how these relates to body weight changes before and after H. pylori eradication.
   Materials and methods: This study prospectively enrolled 129 dyspeptic patients who had received an endoscopy. A fasting blood sample was obtained from each patient for total ghrelin and leptin analysis. The body mass index (BMI) of each patient was also calculated.
   Results: Ninety-four patients tested positive and 35 patients tested negative for H. Pylori. There was no significant difference in the serum leptin and ghrelin levels and BMI between those with or without H. pylori infection. While serum ghrelin concentration was significantly decreased after eradication (8.97 +/- 0.61ng/ml, 6.96 +/- 0.41ng/ml, p = 0.005, respectively), serum leptin concentration and BMI did not change (6.13 +/- 0.86, 5.70 +/- 1.1, p = 0.79, 23.43 +/- 0.26, 23.16 +/- 0.24, p = 0.07, respectively).
   Conclusion: However, no difference was detected in serum ghrelin and leptin levels between H. pylori infected patients and controls, ghrelin levels were decreased with H. pylori eradication, and these differences were correlated with differences in BMI. In conclusion, H. pylori might be play a role on body weight change.

AB Introduction: This study aimed to identify the toxin production and toxin gene profiles of Clostridium difficile species through investigation of C. difficile antigen glutamate dehydrogenase, toxin A/B, and toxin genes in the stool samples of cases of hospital acquired enteritis.
   Materials and methods: This observational prospective study was performed to investigate the place of C. difficile in hospital acquired diarrhea between September 29, 2012, and September 4, 2013. Eighty-two patients between 2012 and 2013 were included in the study. The wards at which patients were admitted, causes of hospitalization, patients' demographics and underlying diseases were recorded. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and toxin A/B were investigated using enzyme immunoassay (EIA). In addition, toxin B, binary toxin genes, and tcdC gene deletion were analyzed with a real time-PCR.
   Results: A total of 82 patients were included in the study. C. difficile antigen was positive in 5 patients using enzyme immunoassay. Toxin A/B positivity was not found in any patients with enzyme immunoassay. Toxin-B gene positivity was found in 3 out of 5 patients with C. difficile antigen positivity with the real-time polymerase chain reaction method. Binary toxin gene positivity and single base deletion in nucleotide 117 of the tcdC gene were found in no patients. The incidence of hospital-originated C. difficile infection was calculated as 0.10 per 10,000 patient days and 0.06 per 10,000 patient admissions.
   Conclusion: CDI is seen in varying rates in different hospitals and countries. In addition, the test methods and kits used, transport, storage, and sample examination conditions, and the patients' epidemiological characteristics might influence the CDI rates. We believe that the antibiotic use policies and infection control precautions in practice in our hospital for a long period are closely related to the low rates of CDIs seen in this study.

AB Introduction: Organ transplantation is the most important treatment method to increase the survival and life quality of people suffering from organ failure. The elderly people constitute an important group who may donate their organs particularly in developed countries, due to their increased proportion in population. In this study, we aimed to determine the knowledge, attitude, and behaviors of individuals aged over 60 about organ donation.
   Materials and methods: This study was conducted in Kahramanmaras, a province in the southern Turkey. A total of 124 individuals aged over 60, applying to policlinics of Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University Faculty of Medicine between 01.10.2014-31.12.2014, were enrolled in the study. A survey on sociodemographic characteristics, and the knowledge, attitude and behaviors about organ donation was performed to all participants.
   Results: Ninety three (75%) of the participants were male, while 31 (25%) were female. The mean age was 69.42 +/- 6.11 (min=60, max=87). Thirty patients (24.2%) stated that they were sufficiently knowledgeable about organ donation and transplantation. Fourteen patients (11.3%) noted they knew where to apply for organ donation while 110 patients (88.7%) noted they did not. Only 1 (0.8%) patient had applied for organ donation and had an organ donor card while 123 patients (99.2%) did not. Thirty seven (29.8%) participants remarked that they desired to donate their organs.
   Conclusions: We revealed that individuals over age of 60 lacked information regarding organ donation. Furthermore, it was observed that the willing to donate organs or to apply for this purpose was low among participants.

AB Aim: To determine whether main pulmonary artery Doppler indices correlate with fetal lung maturity.
   Materials and methods: This prospective cohort study was designed to study Doppler Indices (Plasticity Index, Resistance Index, Systolic-to-Diastolic ratio, Peak systolic Velocity, Acceleration time & Ejection time) in MPA of fetuses in women which impend preterm birth in 3rd trimester (28-37 wks)
   Results: 23 of 145 fetuses (15.86%) developed RDS. Et, at & At/Et ratio of their MPA Doppler were positively correlated with gestational age. S/D ratio, PSV, RI and PI didn' t show correlation with fetal lung maturity. At/Et ratio had strongest predictive value for fetal lung maturity. At/Et ratio cut point >= 0.304 predicted fetal lung maturity in fetuses of 28-37 wks gestational age(sensitivity= 94.3%, specificity=95.7%, positive predictive value=99.1% and negative predictive value = 75,9%).
   Conclusion: Fetal MPA Doppler At/Et ratio can predicts FLM with high sensitivity and specificity as a noninvasive test.

TI VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY OF PERSIAN VERSIONS OF PERITRAUMATIC DISTRESS

AB Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most commonly observed stress-related conditions following a motor vehicle accident, and its effective prevention is a high health-care priority. Although the reliable and valid Dissociative Experience Scale (DES) as the gold-standard instrument to quantify the frequency of self-reported dissociative experiences, and as much the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI; as a self-report measure-validated in several languages) are useful for identifying adults at risk of developing acute and chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), they have not been validated in Iran and their predictive values remain unknown in this population.
   Objective: To assess the reliability and validity of the Persian version of Dissociative Experience Scale (DES) and the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI).
   Method: We included 43 male survivors of fatal motor vehicle accidents. The participants were assessed by PDI and DES, and were retested by DES, and assessed by Mississippi Scale for PTSD in three intervals of immediately after, one month and three months after the event.
   Results: The DES was significantly correlated with PTSD. Reliability analysis revealed a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.87. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient for test-retest analysis was 0.87. The PDI was not significantly correlated with PTSD and was borderline and not significantly correlated with DES. Reliability analysis revealed a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.73.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that Persian versions of PDI and DES showed a desirable psychometric applicability, except for predictive criterion validity for PDI. In regard to predictive validity, DES but not PDI, might be good instruments to use as a reliable screening tool for future PTSD at least in the initial week after MVA.

AB Introduction: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a public health problem worldwide. Peritoneal tuberculosis or tuberculous peritonitis (TBP) is an uncommon form of extrapulmonary infection with a proportional increasing of its incidence. This disease is seen most commonly in young adults, and has a highly variable clinical symptomatology. Our aim is to highlight the nonspecific presentation and diagnostic difficulties of the TBP.
   Materials and methods. We retrospectively reviewed 27 TBP cases diagnosed between 2003 and 2014. Clinical features, all diagnostic methods, and the outcomes of treatment were analyzed in view of literature.
   Results: Abdominal distension and pain were the most frequent symptoms. A past history of pulmonary TB was obtained in 4 patients. Additionally, concomitant extraperitoneal TB was found in 15 cases. Ascites was the most sonographic finding. Acid-fast staining of ascitic fluid was positive in 1/19. Peritoneal biopsy via laparoscopy or laparotomy was positive for TBP in 13/14. Duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was found to be associated with prolongation of the treatment (p<0.001). In addition, pretreatment c-reactive protein was found to be significantly different between the patients requiring a standard therapy of 9 months and the patients requiring additional therapy of 3 months (p=0.023).
   Conclusion: The diagnosis of TBP is often difficult due to diverse presentation. The patient's anamnesis and the presence of ascites are the most significant marks in diagnosis. Laparoscopy with peritoneal biopsy seems to be the gold standard diagnostic method.

AB Introduction: Determination of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) by molecular methods is increasingly common. Together with biochemical and serological diagnostic methods and a histopathological assessment is important to detect necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in the liver. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values are tests often used to predict the histological stages of chronic hepatitis.
   Materials and methods: One hundred seventy-three patients who were referred to the Kahramanmaras Necip Fazil City Hospital Microbiology Laboratory with prediagnosis of HBV infection between September 2012-January 2016, were evaluated with necroinflammatory activity levels/ histological activity index (HAI) and fibrosis scores according to the ISHAK classification criteria, and the results were compared with alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and HBV-DNA serum levels of the time of biopsy.
   Results: The study included 63 female and 109 male patients. The mean age was 39.39 +/- 13.4 years. There was statistically significant difference in age, ALT, AST, and HBV DNA levels between patients in the high fibrosis group and the low fibrosis group (p: 0.034, 0.002, 0.0001, and 0.007, respectively). There was significant difference between patients from severe HAI and mild to moderate HAI groups in terms of AST values (p: 0.045). AST was found to be a risk factor for fibrosis, and ALT and AST were found to be risk factors for HAI. HBV DNA, ALT, and AST levels of HBe-Ag positive patients were significantly higher compared to HBe-Ag negative patients (p: 0,0001, 0,027, 0,008).
   Conclusions: In our study, advanced age, high HBV DNA, ALT and AST levels were found to be associated with fibrosis, and high AST levels were found to be associated with liver necroinflammation. It is thought that serum ALT and AST levels could be useful parameters for liver necroinflammation and fibrosis. Evaluation of these parameters in chronic hepatitis B patients as indicator parameters for advanced stages of fibrosis and necroinflammation would be a right approach.

AB Aim: Natural disasters have numerous effects on vulnerable groups, particularly pregnant women and women in labor. There is little information available about the aftermath of earthquakes on women's reproductive health in Iran and other Middle East countries. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the status of women's reproductive health following East Azerbaijan province earthquakes of August 12, 2012 in Iran.
   Methods: In this qualitative study, 16 earthquake-affected women and 14 health providers from the three struck towns and their villages, and health center and deputy for healthcare of Red Crescent Society of East Azerbaijan province in Iran, participated in semi-structured interviews and data were analyzed by means of qualitative content analysis.
   Results: Four main categories were extracted including psychological complications, reproductive system physical damages, sexual health damages, and fertility regulation. The first category had two subcategories (short term and long term effects).
   Conclusion: Results showed that the earthquake had severe effects on some aspects of women's reproductive health, particularly on pregnant women and women in labor. Providing such cares, must therefore be prioritized in services for earthquake-affected women. This issue shows a demand for decision-makers' and service providers' greater attention to women needs during natural disasters.

AB Objective: The study revealed how Recuperating Lung Decoction (RLD) intervenes in asthma on the basis of successful construction of rabbit asthma model and the effective evaluation guided by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory and metabolomics.
   Materials and methods: 21rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: blank control group, model group, treatment group; in 14 of them, the asthma model was established. The rabbits in the treatment group was treated orally with RLD. The rats in the normal and model groups were given 0.9% saline. Metabolites were compared among the groups, which were determined by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods. Data was analyzed using SAS 8.0.
   Results: A total of 7 kinds of metabolites were detected from the Broncho alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of rabbits, and 4 kinds of metabolites were significant after statistic comparison. The content of some metabolites changed in the model group and treatment group compared with the control group. It could be inferred that the changing was affected by modeling and drug treatment. The increased content of glycine, aspartate and galactose as well as decreased content of myristic acid were closely related to the inflammatory process in bronchial asthma. These 4 metabolites' levels obviously changed after treatment with Recuperating Lung Decoction.
   Conclusion: The study has developed a new Recuperating Lung Decoction intervention model in metabolomic changes of asthma in animal model, and has important theoretical and practical significance with reference to clinical and basic TCM theory.

AB Introduction: The Internet is one of the most important sources to access scientific writing in medical Universities. Internet is one of the world's most popular social media and online addiction is increasing rapidly. Internet can be useful and effective as a new consequence and sometimes can be hazardous and dangerous due to improper use and threaten the mental health of users. Comparing with average users, addicted users' public health and quality sleep are in great danger.
   Objective: The aim of the present research is study of relationship between internet addict with mental health and quality sleep in students.
   Methods: The method of this study is descriptive-correlational. The statistical population of this research consisted of all the Tehran University of Medical sciences. The sample consisted of 250 students that were selected through random sampling. The research instruments included Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI), Mental Health Checklist (MHC) and Internet addiction questionnaire (Young).
   Results: The findings showed there is a significant difference between internet addict with mental health (r= 0/279 p <= 0.01) and sleep quality (r= 0/909 p <= 0.01) and also internet addiction is predicted sleep quality and mental health.
   Conclusion: From data interpretation can be suggested that internet addiction in university student population, similar to classic addictions to drugs, shows negative effects on mental health and sleep quality variables.

DT Article
DE Neutrophil; lymphocyte; major depressive disorder; inflammation
AB Introduction: Neutrophil - lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is accepted as an inflammation marker. The objective of the study is to indicate the variations in NLR that occur in patients with major depressive disorder.
   Materials and methods: Forty prospective patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder based on DSM 4-TR and treated in our clinic were included in the study. The control group included forty healthy individuals that applied to our clinic, however were not diagnosed with active psychopathology in the initial examination, and have matching age and gender demographics with the patient group. Lymphocyte and neutrophil percentages taken during the application before the treatment were recorded in the related forms. NLR was calculated by the division of neutrophil rate by the lymphocyte rate for each patient.
   Results: There was no significant difference between the groups based on socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, income level, smoking, and employment. Mean NLR value was 1.58 +/- 0.59 in the patient group, and it was 2.05 +/- 0.89 in the control group. The difference between these mean values was statistically significant (p=0.007). In control group, the neutrophil percentage, and in patient group the lymphocyte percentage was significantly high. There was no difference between the groups on white blood cell count.
   Conclusion: It was determined that the NLR is significantly lower in patients with major depressive disorder when compared to the control group. The changes in NLR could reflect the changes in central nervous system metabolisms. Thus, NLR could be an indicator of the fact that immune system is suppressed in chronic inflammation in psychiatric diseases such as depressive disorder.

   SHOCK; COMA
AB Introduction: Mushroom poisoning is a serious poisoning that may have a fatal course. Typically, the signs of hepatotoxicity appear 24-36 hours after ingestion. The lactate clearance naturally decreases in impaired hepatic fraction. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of lactate and lactate clearance on the prognosis and the efficacy of therapy in patients with mushroom poisoning hospitalized in the Toxicology Unit.
   Materials and methods: This retrospective study included 236 patients who had been diagnosed with mushroom poisoning upon referral to the Emergency Unit, hospitalized, and treated between July 2008 and March 2013. The patients were divided into two groups as those undergone hemoperfusion and those not undergone hemoperfusion. The patients were also divided into two groups as those with abnormal liver fraction tests and those with normal liver function tests. The lactate clearance of each patient was calculated according to the values of lactate upon referral, lactate at hours 6 and 24 in the blood gas analyses.
   Results: The mean lactate value upon referral in patients with normal liver enzymes was 0.97 +/- 0.48 mmol/L, whereas this was 1.68 +/- 0.63 mmol/L in patients with elevated liver enzymes. The mean lactate clearance values at the 24th hour were 25.76 +/- 14.80% and 36.05 +/- 14.22%, respectively. The mean lactate clearance values at the 24th hour in patients undergoing hemoperfusion and patients not undergoing hemoperfusion were 14.26 +/- 23.52% and 39.48 +/- 14.33%, respectively. The lactate clearance at the 24th hour was significantly higher; particularly in patients with elevated liver enzymes who had received hemoperfusion along with supportive therapy (p<0.001).
   Conclusion: Mushroom poisoning patients with high blood lactate levels on admission to the hospital should be approached carefully with regard to requirement for hemoperfusion and the prognosis.

AB Introduction: Thyroid nodules are common in clinical pathology practice and are the most common indication for thyroidectomies. In the present study we evaluated patients diagnosed with nodular goiter according to preoperative thyroid fine needle aspiration cytology and who also underwent thyroidectomy.
   Materials and methods: The case reports, pathologic reports, and stained sections of 1149 patients who were admitted and underwent thyroidectomy specimens were retrospectively evaluated.
   Results: The cytology and histology records were correlated for 260 cases. The 1149 cases included in this study consisted of 1020 female and 129 male cases with a mean age of 41.4 years (range, 13 to 82 years). The distribution of histological findings are as follows: 999 (72.3%) cases were found to be non-neoplastic and 150 cases (13.1%) were neoplastic. Postoperative histologic evaluation demonstrated 939 (81.7%) cases of nodular hyperplasia, 70 (6.1%) cases of papillary carcinoma, 55 (4.8%) cases of follicular adenoma, 39 (3.4%) cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The correlation of cytology and histopathology showed that 145 of 260 FNA results (55.7%) were concordant, whereas 8 patients (3%) had discordant results. Eighty-five cases were excluded for being non-diagnostic. Histological review revealed incidental papillary thyroid carcinoma in 62 (5.39 %) patients. Mean tumor size was 1.26 cm.
   Conclusion: Nodular hyperplasia was the most common histopathological finding followed by papillary thyroid carcinoma. Improved imaging techniques combined with the correct use of fine-needle aspiration diagnoses may reduce the number of cases that are not treatable by thyroidectomy. It is likely that the early detection of some thyroid cancers is primarily incidental.

AB Introduction: Cardio-renal syndrome (CRS) is a combined disorder in which acute or chronic dysfunction of one of the organs causes acute or chronic dysfunction in the other. CRS affects 20-40% of patients in intensive care.
   Materials and methods: The study enrolled 27 patients hospitalized in the ICU of Catania's Gaspare Rodolico Polyclinic Hospital between April 2014 and May 2015. The patients were 18 to 8.5 years old, 15 females and 12 males, who were admitted to ICU with worsening of a chronic cardiovascular pathology, potentially classifiable as Type 1 or 2 CRS.
   Results: The study found that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) was able to predict acute renal damage and provided a risk stratification, and when B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was also used they increased the capacity to predict a clinical exacerbation.
   Conclusion: The findings confirmed that NGAL and BNP values are helpfitl biomarkers in the diagnosis and treatment of CRS.

TI THE REGULARIZATION SMOOTHING METHOD OF EACH BEAM MONITOR UNIT IN IMRT

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Introduction: For the step and shoot model, which is a traditional realization way in Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy, the inverse planning optimization system needs a set of fluence map for each beam with low complexity to be modulated by the multi-leaf collimator. A lot of image denoising methods have been introduced to smooth the fluence map. Recently, some convex optimization models have been proposed for this work. These methods only consider depressing the map complexity, but neglect the latter leaf sequencing process. Therefore, they can not bring the map complexity to the best state for dose modulation.
   Material and methods: The monitor unit based map convex smoothing model has depressed the total number of monitor unit of the fluence map to the lowest state, but they do not consider the uniformity of each beam dose modulation. Large or small monitor units will lead to the inaccuracy of ray modulation. Furthermore, large difference of the monitor units for each beam fields will lead to the beam angle or beam number adjustment. Based on the above consideration, we proposed a novel regularization smoothing model for fluence map optimization of inverse planning in Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy. We not only consider depressing the total number of monitor units, but also balancing all of them in the model.
   Results: We test this model in a prostate case, and compare with two kind of smoothing methods as well as the monitor unit based map convex smoothing model. The results show our regularization smoothing method will lead to a lower complexity and much more balanced fluence map for the latter leaf sequencing process.
   Discussion: The obvious advantage of the proposed model is that the fluence map complexity is low, as well as the monitor unit distribution of each beam is more evenly.

AB Introduction: Lesion segmentation in mammograms, which affects the subsequent feature extraction and classification, plays a critical step in most of computer-aided detecting and diagnosis (CADx) systems. However, accurate segmentation of suspicious masses from surrounding breast tissues is a challenging and difficult task as lesion boundaries are usually overlapping or touching normal structures, obscured or irregular or low contrast. The aim of this paper is to propose an accurate and robust algorithm for mammographic mass segmentation.
   Material and methods: In this paper, we present new scheme for accurately segmenting breast lesions in mammograms. To achieve this task, two stages are included in this scheme. In the first, a hyperbolic secant template was applied to locate a rough rectangular region of breast lesions. Then, based on the rough region, C-V (Chan-Vese) model was employed to obtain the contour of the being segmented lesions in this region. 483 regions of interest (ROIs) extracted from 328 patients were taken from a publicly available database, the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and formed as the test data set. Area based and boundary distance based similarity measures based on radiologists' manually marked signs were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach and other four algorithms. This paper also provided a comparison between the proposed approach and other four different segmentation algorithms (i.e., Geodesic Active Contours, C-V model, Timp and Karssemeijer's dynamic programming method and marker-controlled watershed segmentation method).
   Results: Experimental results show that our scheme are better than those of other algorithms, the mean overlap percentage and combined measure were 0.7198 0.1149, 0.8056 0.08 respectively. Form experimental results, we also notice that values for all the measures distribution of the proposed method were.
   Discussion: Through the comparison, our scheme has better performance to improve the accuracy of lesions segmentation than other four algorithms.

AB Introduction: We reviewed and analyzed the clinical manifestations, radiographic features, laboratory results, treatments, and outcomes for patients with cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP).
   Materilas and methods: Thirty cases of COP confirmed by pathology between November 2007 and May, 2014 from two comprehensive hospitals in Shanghai and Huzhou were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical manifestations, radiographic features, laboratory results, treatments, and outcomes were collected and analyzed.
   Results: The mean age of COP patients was 55.2 +/- 15.2 years, and their main symptoms included cough, phlegm and fever. Patchy consolidation was the most common lesion, followed by mass/nodule. The leukocyte count was normal while the neutrophil percentage was increased in most patients. Platelet count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were increased. Pulmonary function test results could be normal, restrictive, obstructive, or mixed pattern. The diagnosis of COP was mainly confirmed through computerized tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous needle lung biopsy. COP patients responded poorly to antibiotics but responded well to corticosteroid therapy.
   Conclusion: The clinical manifestations, radiological changes, and laboratory results from COP are nonspecific. CT guided percutaneous needle lung biopsy is the key for the diagnosis. Strengthening the recognition of COP would avoid the use of antibiotics.

DE Paclitaxel; Intraperitoneal Perfusion Chemotherapy; Advanced Ovarian
   Cancer; Clinical Effect
AB Through a relevant search of the literature our group found that paclitaxel peritoneal infusion combined with cisplatin can effectively improve the efficiency of chemotherapy; The aim of this study was to clarify the practical effect of paclitaxel hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy in treatment of advanced ovarian cancer, and to provide scientific guidance for future clinical treatment. This study of 1560 patients with advanced ovarian cancer admitted from June 2013 to June 2014, used combined chemotherapy, provides a detailed analysis of specific chemotherapy of patients during treatment, and records in detail progression-free survival, median survival time, 1 year survival rate, and adverse reactions of all 1560 patients. Compared with the clinical effect of paclitaxel hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, for advanced ovarian cancer by other medical researchers, the specific effect of this treatment is more significant. This study analysis sufficiently proves that Paclitaxel has relatively high clinical :value for advanced ovarian cancer. In particular, with combined chemotherapy with cisplatin, efficacy of the drug will be further brought into play, thereby effectively alleviating patient illness and effectively,improving patient quality of life: This group recommends the combined use of paclitaxel and cisplatin drugs to improve the efficiency of clinical treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer.

DE Abdominal CT; B Ultrasound; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging;
   Extrahepatic Bile Duct Stones; Diagnostic Value
AB To further improve diagnosis and treatment effect of extrahepatic bile duct stones and seize the best opportunity for treatment, this paper conducted in-depth research of the diagnostic value of abdominal CT, B ultrasound and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of extrahepatic bile duct stones, covering 2320 cases of extrahepatic bile duct stones admitted in 5 hospitals from June 2014 to June 2015. All patients underwent abdominal CT, B ultrasound and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnostic results of different detection methods were compared and analyzed by professional image analysis staff. The results show that the detection rate of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging is significantly higher than that of abdominal CT and B ultrasound, with the difference between the two groups P<0.05, statistically significant. The detection rate of CT is significantly higher than that of 13 ultrasound, difference value P<0.05, statistically, significant. At the same time, the detection rate of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging is also higher than that of CT and B ultrasound in the diagnosis of extrahepatic bile duct stones with diameter less than 8cm, with P<0.05, statistically significant. Comparison of CT and B ultrasound detection results reveal no significant difference in the detection rate (P>0.05). Therefore, this study proves that in the diagnosis of extrahepatic bile duct stones, the detection rate of nuclear Magnetic resonance imaging is higher, with diagnosis obviously better, than CT and B ultrasound examination. But clinical diagnosis experience shows that B ultrasound examination has high specificity and costs less.. Therefore, the author believes that diagnosis of extrahepatic bile duct stone in the process of clinical examination depends on the situation of actual patient condition and economic status.

DE Schisandra polysaccharide; diabetes; antioxidant activity;
   alpha-glucosidase inhibitor
AB Introduction: This study investigates the antidiabetic activity of the polysaccharides extracted from the fruits of four common Schisandraceae medicinal plants, which might provide some guidance in the application for the treatment of diabetes.
   Materials and methods: Four crude polysaccharides, CSCP, CSSP, CSRP, and CSNP, were extracted from the fruits of four common Schisandraceae medicinal plants by water extraction and alcohol precipitation method. Their chemical characteristics were determined. In vitro antioxidant properties of four polysaccharides (0.125-2.0 mg/ml) were investigated, including the scavenging ability on hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anion radicals, and DPPH. Moreover, the potential antidiabetic activity of four polysaccharides (0.125-2.0 mg/ml) was also investigated by alpha-glucosidase inhibition assay.
   Results: EC50 values of scavenging ability on hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anion radicals, DPPH for CSCP and CSSP were 1.18 and 1.39 mg/mL, 0.89 and 1.02 mg/mL, 0.58 and 0.49 mg/mL, respectively. EC50 values of inhibitory activity on a-glucosidase for CSCP and CSSP were 0.93 and 1.42 mg/mL, respectively.
   Discussion: CSCP and CSSP have a satisfactory antioxidant effect, and should be ideal natural antioxidants. Furthermore, CSCP and CSSP are also a-glucosidase inhibitors due to their lower EC50, indicating that their may play a positive role in the treatment of diabetes.

DE Multi-Slice CT Signs; Intestinal Infarction; Acute Mesenteric Artery;
   Disease Staging; Correlation
AB To fully explore the correlation between various spiral CT signs of intestinal infarction caused by acute mesenteric thrombosis and lesion staging and prognosis in later period of infarction. The study performed multi-slice spiral CT,detection on 2600 patients. All patients were diagnosed with acute mesenteric infarction and there were different levels of ischemic symptoms. Reasons for their ischemia were analyzed. Also, statistics software was applied to analyze the correlation between multi-slice CT signs and intestinal infarction lesion staging and prognosis. The results show an obvious correlation between multi-slice CT signs of patients with acute mesenteric vascular infarction and intestinal infarction lesion staging and prognosis. Multi-slice CT signs, can clearly show staging of intestinal infarction lesions. Specifically, when a patient's intestinal density is relatively high, the prognosis is good; when a patient's intestine exhibits expansion, the prognosis is poor. Multi-slice spiral CT can effectively predict pathology of intestinal infarction and provide valuable information on disease staging and prognosis for treatment in the course of clinical care. Therefore, it is very useful to confirm disease stage with multi-slice CT signs.

AB Introduction: To further increase diagnosis accuracy of lung cancer and seize the optimal opportunity for treatment, in this paper we conducted in-depth analysis on application value of joint detection of CYFRA21-1, NSE, CEA, CA19-9, CA125 and SCC in diagnosis of lung cancer.
   Materials and methods: In this research, 1000 patients, who have been clinically diagnosed with lung cancer, were selected into observation group, in which there were 312 patients of small cell carcinoma, 458 with adenocarcinoma, and remaining 330 with squamous carcinoma. In addition, 200 healthy people were selected as research objects in control group. Electrochemistry luminescence method was adopted to test index levels of the two groups, respectively, with test items including CYFRA21-1, NSE, CEA, CA19-9, CA125, SCC.
   Results: Test results showed the serum indexes of observation group were significantly higher than those of control group. In addition, through comparing 3 different types of lung cancer patients, patients with small cell carcinoma had a significantly higher concentration of serum NSE than those with squamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma; the concentrations of CA125, CEA, CA19-9 in patients with adenocarcinoma were higher than that of patients with squamous carcinoma or small cell carcinoma; the concentrations of CYFRA21-1 in patients with squamous carcinoma was the highest of the three. Moreover, it finally confirmed 958 lung cancer patients in total by testing 6 serum indexes of all selected patients, with positive rate accounting for 87.09%.
   Conclusion: As a result, it is of vital significance to test serum indexes such as CYFRA21-1, NSE, CEA, CA19-9, CA125, SCC for suspected lung cancer patients, and the concentrations of different indexes play key roles in confirming type of lung cancer. Finally, it concluded that joint detection of serum markers can further enhance diagnosis efficiency, which should be promoted in clinical practice.

AB Introduction: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common opportunistic pathogens in nosocomial infections. It is also one of the primary organisms responsible for drug resistant infections. The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial resistance profile of P. aeruginosa, the presence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and pan drug-resistant (PDR) strains and distribution of the most common serotypes among hospitalized patients in University Clinical Center of Kosovo (UCCK).
   Materials and methods: During a one-year period, 229 P. aeruginosa were isolated from infected patients in clinics of UCCK from a variety of clinical sites. 80 isolates were studied as the primary isolates from the group of infected patients. P. aeruginosa isolates were identified using standard laboratory procedures. Susceptibility of isolates to antimicrobial agents was investigated using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion assay (EUCAST 2013). All isolates were serotyped by slide agglutination with commercial sera from Biorad.
   Results: The most prevalent serotype was 011; this serotype showed higher resistance to antibiotics compared with other serotypes. Serotype 011 isolates were generally susceptible to imipenem and meropenenz, and most often resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, and piperacillin-tazobactam. Thirteen of 80 (283%) P. aeruginosa were MDR and 7 of 80 (8.8%) P. aeruginosa were XDR of the isolates tested. No PDR P. aeruginosa were detected. Multiply resistant strains were most frequently isolated from Intensive Care Unit patients.
   Conclusion: The present study provides data gathering from a region where there is not a wealth of data available. It is of utmost importance in an increasing "antibiotic crisis". Prudent use of carbapenems is of deep importance. Imipenem and meropenem should be reserved for treatment of MDR P. aeruginosa. Existence and escalation of multiresistant strains, especially of MDR, XDR P. aeruginosa necessitates continuous surveillance, development strategies and increased control of prescription practices.

DE Bunting; Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery; Hemostasis Effect
AB To further explore the clinical effect of bunting in otolaryngology head and neck surgery, and provide a safer and more effective clinical medical service for patients, we selected 3000 cases of otolaryngology head and neck patients admitted to ten hospitals from March 2015 to September 2014. The patients were randomly divided by digital methods into control group and observation group, with 1500 cases each. Conventional hemostasis was, adopted for control group patients, when they were treated by otolaryngology and neck surgery, while bunting was adopted to stop bleeding for the experimental, group patients in clinical surgery. The hemostatic status of the two groups of patients was recorded and analyzed by professional nursing staff. The results show different hemostatic effects in the two GROUPS's of patients. The experimental group had preoperative intramuscular injection of bunting, and 45 patients achieved excellent hemostasis effect, with the hemostatic rate reaching 92% (138011500). After comparison of the hemostasis effect of conventional hemostasis method in the control group, bleeding volume and operation time of the observation group were significantly lower than that of control group patients. The difference between the two groups P<0.05, was statistically significant. The study found that various cases may arise in clinical process of otolaryngology head and neck surgery; the situation is relatively complex. Therefore, the conventional hemostasis method cannot be applied to every operation, and clinical application of bunting can not only compensate for this defect, but also produce good effect on hemostasis and coagulation, while effectively shortening operation time, reducing the patient's physical and economic burden, and thus is worthy to be widely promoted and applied in clinics.

   GUIDELINES
AB Introduction: Heart failure (HF) is one of the major condition able to determine bilateral pleural effusion. The diagnostic value of combined use of Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and Light's criteria in the diagnosis of HF is unclear.
   Materials and methods: 109 patients with both heart failure and bilateral pleural were included in this study. Serum BNP, pleural effusion character were analyzed. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of BNP and Light's criteria in the diagnosis of HF were analyzed.
   Results: 109 patients were included. Serum BNP and percentage of Light's negative patients are higher in patients with HF than those without. When combining BNP positive with Light's criteria together, the diagnostic sensitivity increased to 86.8%. BNP negative together with Light's positive had a good exclusive diagnostic value. The cutoff value of BNP was proved to be 186.9 pg/ml the diagnosis of HF for patients with bilateral pleural effusion.
   Conclusion: Combined use of BNP and Light's criteria could increase the diagnostic sensitivity in patients with bilateral pleural effusion and could help recognize those without HF. For patients with bilateral pleural effusion, serum BNP test should be the initial test to recognize and differentially diagnose HF.

AB Introduction: To explore the potential target points and mechanism of Yinlai decoction's anti-inflammatory effects, through analyzing the prescription of Yinlai decoction with the method of network pharmacology, in order to provide targeted guidance for experimental research.
   Materials and methods: Traditional Chinese Medicine System Platform (TCMSP) database was used to establish database for related target points of Yinlai decoction's anti-inflammatory effect, String database was applied to analyze the interaction among target points and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was utilized to analyze related pathways of Yinlai decoction's inflammatory effect.
   Results: A total of 20 important target points of Yinlai decoction's anti-inflammatory effects were found. There were 71 interactions in the network composed of these target points, among which 26 interactions were important. 53 inflammation-related pathways were found (P-Value <0.001), among which the most closely related signaling pathways included Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) signaling pathway, Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain receptors (NOD) -like receptor signaling pathway and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway.
   Conclusion: Yinlai decoction's anti-inflammatory effects are achieved by joint interventions of complicated pathways of many target points, but the specific regulatory mechanism remains to be further explored and verified.

AB Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine disorder of women. Most of PCOS women have great pressure because of infertility. Aim of our study is to observe the clinical efficacy of acupuncture therapy on the treatment of anxiety disorder in patients with PCOS and compare the therapeutic effect differences between acupuncture therapy and Clomiphene Citric (CC) therapy.
   Materials and methods: 90 PCOS patients were allocated into acupuncture combined with CC group (group A), acupuncture group (group B) and CC group (group C) randomly, 30 cases in each group. The acupoints were Ganshu (BL18), Shenshu (BL23), Zhongwan (CV12), Shuifen (CV9), Guanyuan (CV4), Zhongji (CV3). Back-shu points were used alternatively. Fast rotating needling insertion method and mild reinforcing-reducing manipulation were operated. The needle retaining time was 30 minutes. The patients in group A and group B received acupuncture therapy 3 times per week. The CC was taken on the 5th-9th day of menstrual cycle. All the patients were treated for 3 months and followed-up for 1 month. The self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and ovulation rate of the 3 groups were counted.
   Results: 3 cases dropped out in the trail. The SAS scores declined both of group A and B after treatment. The ovulation rates of group A, B and C were as follows: 86.21%, 66.67% and 69.64%. The clinical efficacy of group A was higher than the other groups (P<0.05).
   Discussion: Acupuncture therapy can enhance ovulation rate of PCOS patients effectively as well as CC therapy. But it is a better method to improve the anxiety disorder than CC therapy. The combined application of acupuncture therapy and CC therapy has better curative effect, which should be widely spread in clinics.

AB Development and application of VSD orthopedic treatment technology has brought good news for orthopedic trauma infection patients. But some medical personnel are not very clear about the clinical effectiveness of the technology. To further explore the actual clinical effect of VSD treatment in orthopedic trauma treatment, this paper retrospectively analyzed 3248 patients who received orthopedic trauma treatment in major hospitals from March 2014 to October 2015 as research subjects, randomly divided them into treatment group with 1986 cases (VSD treatment), and control group with 1262 cases (conventional drainage treatment) according to their treatment methods. After a retrospective analysis of medical records of all patients, it was found that the therapeutic effect of treatment group patients was significantly higher than that of control group patients, with statistically significant differences <0.05. Thus,, the results of this study further confirm that VSD treatment can effectively reduce the probability of infection and other complications of orthopedic patients during treatment.

AB Introduction: Statins are powerful lipid-modifying agents; however, they have dose-dependent risk for liver dysfunction. Ezetimibe possesses a relatively low lipid-modifying activity, but is less likely to cause liver dysfunction. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of ezetimibe-based therapy in hyperlipidemia patients with concomitant liver dysfunction. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of ezetimibe combined with metformin and simvastatin in the treatment of hyperlipidemia patients with liver dysfunction.
   Materials and methods: From January 2012 to March 2014, 210 hyperlipidemia patients with liver dysfunction were enrolled and assigned to control (a low-dose sinzvastatin), ezetimibe + a low-dose simvastatin (ES) or ezetimibe + metformin + a low-dose simvastatin (EMS) groups (n=70 per group). Before treatment, the blood lipids, glucose, creatine kinase (CK), and liver and kidney functions were detected. Patients with >= 2x upper limit of normal values of transaminases were excluded. Treatment was conducted for 3 months. CK, aspartate transminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and bilirubin were measured after 3-month treatment.
   Results: After 3-month treatment, significant reductions were found in total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in three groups. The CK, TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C and liver function were significantly different among 3 groups after 3-month treatment.
   Conclusion: Ezetimibe-based therapy has more potent lipid-modifying capability in hyperlipidemia patients with liver dysfunction, without deteriorating liver function.

AB Background and aim: Aim of this study wasto compare the efficacy and complications of transurethral lithotripsy (TUL) by semirigidureteroscope and Holmium laser versus extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) in treatment of radiopaque upper ureteralstones.
   Materials and methods: Inthisrandomized clinical trial, 59patients with upper ureteralstones withsize of 5-15 mm candidate for Lithotripsy, after taking informed consent form and approval of ethics committee, randomly assigned in two groups. In the first group, ESWL was done in supine position using Dornier Delta 2 machine with ultrasound Shockwavesvia standard methods. In second group, after Anesthesia by standard methods, patients were placed in lithotomy position and lithotripsy was done by semirigidureteroscope (Wolf 6-8 F) and Holmium laser (Auriga) by standard methods. In both groups, two weeks post-operation, the patients visited again and a KUB with ultrasonography was done for efficacy of the operation and complications and results were checked and analyzed by SPSS software version 15 and statistical tests.
   Results: the mean age of patients in ESWL and Ureteroscopic groups were 43.7 +/- 15.5and 45.25 +/- 14.5years respectively (p> o.o5). The mean size of stones in two groups was 11.85 +/- 3.7 and 10.44 +/- 2.8mm respectively (p> o.o5). Complete efficacy (clearance of stones or residual stones less than 4mm) in ESWL and semirigid uretero scope were 87.5% and 85% respectively (p>0.05). Regarding complications, there was no significant difference between two groups.
   Conclusion: transurethral lithotripsy by semirigidureteroscopy with Holmium laser has similar efficacy with ESWL in treatment of upper ureteral stones and this modality can be used as an alternative and efficient option in treatment of upper ureteral stones.

DE Tubeless percutaneous nephrolithotomy; position; success; complications
AB Introduction: Nowadays Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy(PCNL) is the first line treatment for large renal stones, upper ureteral stones (more than 15-20 mm), resistant stones to Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy) ESWL (multiple staghorn kidney stones. This procedure is usually performed in prone position accompany with inserting nephrostomy tube, but recent studies suggested that tubeless PCNL in supine position is as well as and in some ways are better than the standard PCNL in prone position. So, this study was conducted to compare the success and complications of tubeless PCNL in prone and supine position.
   Materials and methods: In this randomized clinical trial 64 patients aged 18 years and over with renal or upper ureteral stones that were referred toShahidBeheshti hospital of Yasuj from 2013 march to 2015 February for PCNL and met inclusion criteria, were randomly assigned to undergo surgery in supine or prone position after taking informed consent. All PCNLs were done with fluoroscopy-guided by one urologist. After operation without inserting any tube Amplatz dilator removed and patients were transferred to recovery and ward. In the first postoperative day, if there were no complications, patients were discharged. One week later, patients were visited again and Kidney-ureters-bladder (KUB) plain radiography and ultrasonography were done for assessing the success rate. Data were analyzed by SPSS21 software using descriptive and analytical statistics.
   Results: Mean size of stones in patients underwent surgery in supine and prone position were 32.81+/-5.2 mm and 36.25+/-4.3 mm, respectively(p=0.47). Mean time of operation in supine and prone position were 81.68+/-26.45 and 94.68+/-21.88 minutes, respectively (p=0.1). There wasn't significant difference in partial and complete success rate between supine (53.1%, 46.9%) and prone (43.8%, 56.2%) position(p=0.45). Mean length of hospital stay was 1.37+/-0.65 and 1.43+/-0.87 days in prone and supine position, respectively (p=0.74). There wasn't significant difference in complications after PCNL between supine (12.5%) and prone (12.9%) position (p=0.32).
   Conclusion: Tubeless PCNL in supine position is a safe procedure with similar performance compared to prone position for the treatment of urolithiasis stones.

AB Introduction: Statins are basically used for hyperlipidemia therapy, but also may be useful for protection from cardiovascular events. In addition, there is increasing evidence for the potential positive effect of statin therapy on the outcome of patients with sepsis.
   Material and methods: In a randomized double blinded clinical trial, we evaluated 60 patients aged 18-85 with confirmed sepsis. We evaluated APACHE II score and all-cause mortality as outcome predictors.
   Results: The APACHE score in days1 and 3 was not significantly different between two groups, but in day 7 it was significantly higher in group B than group A. Survival after one month (mean +/- 95% CI) also had not significant differences. The number needed to treat (NNT) was 5.
   Conclusion: The mainstem of the studies suggest that statins may have a positive effect on the outcome of patients with sepsis. However, the majority of the available studies had the inherent methodological flaws of retrospective design. We concluded that regarding present evidence, clinician should wait for the results of ongoing relevant randomized controlled trials.

AB Benzene is a known human carcinogenic and a natural ingredient of crude oil and other petroleum products. The burning of biomass also results in a release of benzene. Epidemiological studies show evidence for a causal association between leukemia and exposure to benzene. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate urinary benzene as biomarker of exposure to environmental benzene. Urine samples were collected from 73 adult males resident in Tehran, Iran. The urinary level of benzene was analyzed using by head space solid phase micro extraction-gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry method (HS-SPME-GC-MS-method). Median value of U-BEN was 0.94 mu g/l (range from 0.2 to 2.9). The results of this study showed that urinary benzene is higher than values shown in prior studies. Thus, these high values may have undesirable health effects on the people resident in Tehran. Since urinary benzene behave in a similar way to blood benzene, urinary benzene due to the quick accessibility of urine and a non-invasive option is useful for environmental exposure and for epidemiology studies. As a result, the role of passive smoking and high traffic as the most important contributor to benzene exposure is very important.

AB Introduction: According to increase prevalence rate of substance abuse and appears a reduction in mean age of onset substance use in Iranian society and importance of developing theory and evidence-based prevention family skills training programs the present study was done aimed to investigate family-based cognitive factors effective in preventing the onset of substance use in Iranian society's children by applying the intervention mapping protocol.
   Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out among 234 Iranian mothers in Tehran who were randomly selected to participate voluntarily in the study. The participants filled out a self-administered questionnaire. Data were analyzed by the SPSS software (ver. 21.0) using Pearson correlations, independent t-test, ANOVA and linear regression at 95% significant level.
   Results: Knowledge, attitude, perceived risk, subjective norms, and self-efficacy were cognitive factors that accounted for 48% of the variation in the outcome measure of the behaviors in preventing the onset of substance use among children. Linear regression showed that self-efficacy (beta = 0.509 & P = 0.001), attitude (beta = 0.436 & P = 0.009), subjective norms (beta = 0.344 & P = 0.028) and Behavioural intention (beta = 0.222 & P = 0.001) were the most influential predictors on preventing the onset of substance use among children.
   Conclusion: The findings suggest that to developing a theory and evidence-based prevention family skills training program it will be useful to increase mothers' self-efficacy, attitude, subjective norms, and Behavioural intentionto preventing the onset of substance use among children.

AB The purpose of the present study was examining the role of personality traits in predicting defense mechanisms with mediating Role of Attribution Styles in University Students. The study sample consisted of 300 students of Islamic Azad University of Zanjan who were selected through a random stratified method. The research instruments were, NEO-Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-FFI-R), Defense Mechanisms Questionnaire (DSQ-40), and Attributional Style Questionnaires (ASQ-48). Data analysis was carried out through Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Structural Equation Modeling (LISREL). The results showed that significant positive relationship among personality dimensions, i.e. extraversion, openness to experience, and conscientiousness with mature defense mechanisms, among personality dimensions, i.e. extraversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness with neurotic defense mechanisms, and among positive attribution style with mature and neurotic defense mechanisms. There was a negative significant relationship among neuroticism with mature defense mechanism and positive attribution style. Modeling and structural equation analysis proved the significant mediation of attribution styles in relationship between personality traits and defense mechanisms. According to the results of the present study, personality traits indirectly determined the type of defense mechanisms employed by the individuals through their attribution styles.

AB Background and aim: The present study, which was conducted in correlational framework, aims to examine the relationship between cognitive skills with academic achievement in a sample of high school students in Kermanshah city, Iran.
   Materials and methods: The population included a total number of 27627 high school students in Kermanshah in 2013-2014, among whom 200 applicants were selected through multistage cluster sampling. Cognitive and metacognitive questionnaires were employed as research tools and their reliability were measured through split half and coefficient alpha, which were reported as 0.84 and 0.73 for cognitive questionnaires and 0.92 and 0.79 for metacognitive questionnaire. To examine applicant academic achievement. Their academic files in schools as well as their mean scores were carefully considered. The data were analyzed through Persons correlation coefficient and multistage regression in SPSS, v.20.
   Results: The finding showed that there was a correlation between cognitive skills and academic achievement and between metacognitive skill and academic achievement. The results of multistage regression, in addition, showed that semantic expansion among cognitive components and control and supervision among metacognitive components could explain the variance of academic achievement. Furthermore, it was revealed that learners' views were significantly related to the metacognitive skills, and both cognitive and metacognitive skills based on gender and region, respectively.
   Conclusion: According to the finding concluded that students who are recruited cognitive and metacognitive skills, experience high academic achievement and using of these strategies and effective in academic achievement.

AB Background: Changes in sense of taste in pregnancy may have effects on nutritional status of pregnant women and consequently on maternal and fetal health.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in gustatory function during pregnancy.
   Materials and methods: This cross sectional descriptive study, was conducted on pregnant and non-pregnant women admitted to the maternity ward of governmental hospitals of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Iran in 2015. In this study 264 healthy women aged 20-30 years assigned into four groups (n=66): FT group - first trimester of pregnancy, ST group - second trimester of pregnancy, TT group - third trimester of pregnancy and Control nol non-pregnant. The detection and recognition thresholds of taste were assessed using serial concentrations of sucrose, sodium chloride, quinine hydrochloride and citric acid solutions for sense of sweet, salty, bitter and sour, respectively. Data were analyzed by SPSS software using ANOVA, Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests. (P<0.05)
   Results: Sweet detection threshold was ranked in a decreasing order as control, first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester (P=0.024). There was a significant difference in sweet detection threshold only between control and TT group (P=0.002). There were not significant differences among four groups in salty (P=0.757), bitter (P=0.637), and sour (P=0.072) detection thresholds. Frequency of incorrect recognition threshold was 4.5% in non-pregnant women and 12.6% in pregnant women (P=0.065)
   Conclusion: This study revealed that detection threshold of sweet taste was reduced with initiation and progression of pregnancy.

AB Aim: Behcet's Disease (BD) is s a complex disease which occurs as a result of the involvement of different systems. In this study, we aim to determine the importance of clinical findings and demographic data in its occurence and in understanding the prognostic importance of BD, and to establish the influencing factors of these findings.
   Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective statistical analysis on the clinical and demographic data assessed by examining the patient charts of 703 patients with BD who were admitted to the Behcet outpatient clinic in Erciyes University Department of Dermatology between 1998-2010.
   Results: Seven hundred and three patients were included in this study, of which 297 (42.2%) were male, and 406 (57.8%) were female. The mean age at diagnosis of the disease was 30.1 +/- 19.1 years. Mucocutaneous findings were the most frequent and first seen findings of the disease. The most frequent finding after mucocutaneous ones was ocular involvement. It was observed that vascular involvement was more common in male patients compared to female ones. In contrast, genital ulcer, erythema nodosum and arthralgia were seen more in female patients than in males.
   Conclusion: There is not a specific laboratory, monitoring or histopathologic examining method for the diagnosis and assessment of the prognosis of the disease. Consequently, it seems that the age, gender, genotype and other existing clinical findings of the patient give a clue to the prognosis of the disease.

AB Aim: This study aimed to evaluate nurses' attitude of Ayatollah Rohani hospital, Babol from the patient's clinical records on the efficiency and quality of nursing services.
   Matherials and methods: after reviewing the literature, a primary model was presented in the form of five factors influencing adoption of the system. Then, questionnaire consisted of 26 questions was designed based on these factors, and after making sure of the reliability and validity based on the judgment of experts and Cronbach's alpha coefficient, a questionnaire was distributed among 350 nurses of Ayatollah Rohani hospital, Babol in 2013 who were selected using randomized sampling. In order to test the model fitness and to investigate the relationships between variables, structural equation modeling was used using LISREL.
   Results: obtained scores of nurses attitudes in four dimensions (time, exchange of information, the role of the nurse and the quality of services) bu using the independent two sample t-test and variance analysis (ANOVA) showed that there was no significant difference (P>0.05) in none of the various levels of demographic variables such as gender, marital status, education, work experience and sectors. In contrast, one-sample t-test results showed that the four dimensions average was more than 3 (P<0.05) and therefore, the nurses attitude to the mentioned four dimensions was acceptable.
   Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the majority of nurses in this center believe that the clinical records of patients in hospitals reduce hospitals costs in addition to increase the quality of nursing care.

AB Aim: Adiponectin is an adiposity secreted hormone that plays a pivotal role in lipid and glucose metabolism that may also be a marker for coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of endurance training on Adiponectin and insulin resistance in overweight female university students.
   Methods: In this regard, 20 sedentary young women subject (BMI >= 25) have randomly been divided into to two similar groups (endurance training and control). The endurance training program was performed three days a week for 12 weeks at a definite intensity and distance. Before and after 12 weeks intervention, Adiponectin, weight and body composition, Vo2max were measured for all subjects. Data were analyzed by independent t-test (p <= 0.05).
   Results: the results illustrated that endurance training caused a significant difference in Adiponectin, Vo2max, body weight and fat percent of the body of the experimental group in comparison to control group.
   Conclusion: endurance training leads to a significant increase of the levels of Adiponectin and significant decrease in insulin resistance. This suggests that the insulin resistance is affected by endurance training that may be mediated, even partially through increased Adiponectin in overweight female university students.

AB Background: Genital wart (condyloma accuminata) is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STI) which is highly contagious. Human papilloma virus (HPV) subtypes 6 and 11 are responsible for this condition in about 90% of cases. Transmission of this virus occurs via direct contact with skin and sexual contact. The objective of this study was to determine living condition and involved anatomic areas of 206 women with genital warts.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 206 women who presented to our university dermatology clinic and for whom the diagnosis of genital wart was made were included. They noted the warts by themselves or by their sexual partner. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients to participate in this study. A checklist was designed which included variables namely living condition, age, and anatomic areas affected by genital warts.
   Results: Mean age of the patients was 31 years. About 39.2% of the cases had educational level of high school diploma or higher. Illiteracy was detected in five percent of the population. About 65.3% of the cases were married and 34.6% was single. Economic level of 68.1% of the cases was middle, 12.3% was low, and 19.6% was high. About 51.5% was housewives, 13.1% was self-employed, 15.7% was governmental clerks, 15.3% was unemployed, and the lowest percentage (4.6%) was seen in university students. Peri-anal area (31.1%) and labia minora (38.1%) were the most commonly affected anatomic areas.
   Conclusion: Increase women's awareness to reduce the epidemic of genital warts is important and an issue that needs to be given

TI THE EFFECTS OF SUBLINGUAL MISOPROSTOL AND INTRAVENOUS OXYTOCIN IN
   REDUCING BLEEDING AMONG CESAREAN DELIVERIES

ID ORAL MISOPROSTOL; BLOOD-LOSS
AB Introduction: Up to now, no study has been done to detect the comparison of sublingual misoprostol versus oxytocin effect in reducing Hemorrhage employing doses less than 400 mg. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of high and low doses of sublingual misoprostol with intravenous oxytocin in reducing bleeding in cesarean section deliveries.
   Materials and methods: In this clinical trial, 185 women who underwent cesarean section in Imam Reza Hospital during 9 months of the 2011-12 year were selected by convenience sampling method. Patients were randomly assigned to three groups with foursome random blocks: misoprostol 400 mcg, 200 mcg misoprostol and oxytocin 20 units were conducted.
   Results: The groups were matched for age, BMI and gravidity. Bleeding after delivery was significantly (P=0.003) in the oxytocin group lower and in the misoprostol 400 mcg group was higher than others. Oxytocin group (n=5), compared to the other groups had a greater need for blood transfusion (P=0.031). 400 mcg misoprostol group (n=3) were less likely to require oxytocin infusion (P=0.042). The three groups did not differ in terms of developing the complication.
   Conclusion: Emergency and elective cesarean patients using sublingual misoprostol 200 mcg needs no blood transfusion. This protocol can be a safe and effective alternative to the use of sublingual misoprostol 400 mcg and 20 IU oxytocin. It is suggested that in cesarean section to reduce the need for transfusion of blood and lost blood, the prescription be taken into account. Also, in future studies to examine this issue are addressed in the high-risk population.

AB Introduction: Orthopedic surgery is one of the most painful surgeries. This study aimed to investigate the effect of aromatherapy on pain after orthopedic surgery.
   Methods: This study is a randomized and controlled clinical trial involving 82 patients undergoing orthopedic surgery of wrist fracture in randomly selected hospitals of Tehran in 2015. The patients of the treatment group, 8 and 16 hours after surgery, sniffed 3 drops of essential oil of lemon for 20 minutes and the intensity of pain was measured half an hour after the intervention. For the control group, routine healthcare services continued. Data was analyzed using the SPSS 21 software and descriptive and inferential statistics. Moreover, in order to measure the effects of aromatherapy and change trends, repeated measures ANOVA was used. Chi-square test was also used to determine the success rate of the treatment.
   Results: Comparison of changes in pain scores between the two groups showed that there is a significant relationship (p=. 049) between the intensity of pain in control and treatment groups during the examined intervals (mean of pain and anxiety reduction 8 and 16 hours after surgery). There was also a significant relationship between the recovery rates of the control and treatment groups and different intervals (p=. 008).
   Conclusion: The results of the study indicate a positive impact of aromatherapy with essential oils of lemon on the reduction of pain, 8 and 16 hours after orthopedic surgery. Therefore, it can be used as a non-pharmacological, inexpensive, and non-invasive care nursing-method with no complication in the orthopedic surgical sections.

AB Introduction: The association between secundum atrial septal defect and mitral valve disease has been recognized for many years.
   Case presentation: A female patient was admitted to the hospital with sudden onset of congestive heart failure symptoms. Diagnostic methods revealed an enlarged right ventricle, secundum atrial septal defect, tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension, mitral regurgitation with chordal rupture of the mitral valve. Treatment involved replacement of the mitral valve with a mechanical prosthesis and closure of the atrial septal defect with sutures.
   Conclusion: In a patient with asymptomatic atrial septal defect, a sudden increase in left to right cardiac shunting due to acute mitral regurgitation precipitated right heart failure.

ID CARDIAC-SURGERY; TRANSFUSION
AB Introduction and objective: Bleeding caused by coagulopathy after Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) leads to morbidity and mortality. Research results suggest thatTranexamic Acid (TA) plays a major role in reducing bleeding after heart surgery. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of preoperative TA and post-CPB TA on the decrease in bleeding after heart surgery.
   Materials and methods: A total of 60 patients, who were candidates for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG), were randomly categorized into two groups after their written consent was obtained. First, before the surgery, TA was added to the serum of group I and normal saline was added to the serum of group II. After detachment from CPB, normal saline was injected to group I and TA was injected to group II. Postoperative bleeding was measured based on the volume of blood flowing into the chest bottle of patients and the number of blood units transfused to patients after surgery was recorded.
   Results: Investigation results revealed that although bleeding during surgery in the pre-pump group was higher than the post-pump group, the difference was not significant. The average volume of bleeding in the pre-pump group was higher than the post-pump group, but the difference was not statistically significant either. Moreover, pre-pump TA did not lead to a reduction in the need for transfusion during surgery. The level of bleeding in the first 2 hours after hospitalization in ICU was significant lower in the pre-pump group. However, no significant difference was observed between the duration stay of the groups in ICU.
   Conclusion: Pre-pump administration of TA did not result in a significant decrease in bleeding during surgery, need for transfusion, duration of stay in ICU, and duration of hospitalization as compared to post-pump TA administration.

AB Introduction: In this research it was aimed to observe the anti-inflammatory effect of Naru3-Babu Plaster on adjuvant arthritis (AA), its analgetic effect on mice and its condition of toxicology.
   Materials and methods: Establish the rat model of AA to measure the anti-inflammatory and analgetic effects of Naru3-Babu plaster; establish the rabbit and cavy model to observe the acute toxicity; establish the rabbit model with 150 cm2 molted on backbone to take the long term toxicity test of Naru3-Babu plaster.
   Results: Naru3-Babu Plaster could reduce obviously the inflammation in AA rats. The toe volume and swelling degree decreased at 6th hour compared with that of the model group. Naru3 Cataplasm inhibited also the secondary inflammation induced by Freund's Adjuvant, Complete (FAC). Its anti-inflammatory effect began to be obvious at 8th day and very obvious at 24th day. At the same time the levels of IL-1, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF alpha) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in rat serum decreased. Naru3-Babu plaster increased remarkably the threshold of pain and pain-inhibition rate in mice. The rabbits and cavies in short term toxicity tests showed no adverse reactions.
   Conclusion: According to the results, Naru3-Babu plaster has an anti-inflammatory and analgetic effects and no acute term toxicity.

AB Purpose: To compare combined MyoRing implantation with previously corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL-MyoRing) versus MyoRing implantation alone in patients with keratoconus.
   Methods: This retrospective, comparative, cohort study included 33 eyes of 33 patients with keratoconus stage II and III according to Amsler-Krumeich classification. Two groups were performed for this study with 1 year follow up. The group 1 received MyoRing implantation and the group 2 received CXL approximately 12 months before MyoRing implantation. All patients had a complete pre and post-operative examination including visual, refractive and keratometry examinations.
   Results: In Group 1 at the end of follow up the mean UDVA and CDVA improved by 9 and 4 lines of logMAR. In Group 2 the mean UDVA and CDVA improved by 8 and 2 lines of logMAR. There was not observed a statistically significant difference between mean UDVA of two groups postoperatively (p = 0.142) whereas the mean CDVA in Group 2 was significantly better than mean Group 1 at the end of follow up (p = 0.018). Spherical equivalent error and refractive astigmatism were significantly reduced in both groups which no statistically significant differences was noted in these refractive parameters between two groups. The mean keratometric values also were reduced in both groups at the end of follow up which no statistically significant difference was observed between two groups.
   Conclusion: Both MyoRing implantation alone and combined MyoRing implantation with previously CXL were safe and effective methods for moderate and severe keratoconus and resulted in similar clinical outcomes after one year follow up. ExclusivelyMyoRing implantation alone demonstrated better outcome in mean CDVA.

DE Hypertension; dermatoglyphics; prognosis; prevention
AB Introduction: Dermatoglyphics is the analysis of fingerprints as a genetic marker that can be related to health, sports and disease prognosis. Since the method analyzes genetic markers, finding a pattern or rare marker for certain diseases is very important, it may be a useful tool for disease prognosis and diagnosis.
   Objective: Investigate dermatoglyphics as a prognosis method for hypertension.
   Method: This is an applied analytical study, with a quantitative approach, using the technical procedures of descriptive research. The sample was composed of 268 adults, 134 with hypertension and 134 controls, of both sexes and different ages. Fingerprints were collected from all fingers, starting with the little finger on the left hand and concluding with the little finger on the right hand. The method applied to determine the profile of individuals is computerized dermatoglyphics, using a dermatoglyphic reader to collect the fingerprints. Statistical analyses were processed in Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS), 20.0, at a significance level of p <= 0.05. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to compare the two groups and their quantitative variables to determine if they were normally distributed. In the event of non-normal distribution, the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test was applied to compare the following numerical variables.
   Results: There was a significant difference in the number of lines on finger 5 of the right hand, the hypertensive group exhibiting the lowest number. In addition to the statistically significant difference in the ulnar loop pattern on the 5th finger of the left hand, and 4th and 5th of the right hand, this pattern appeared more frequently in the hypertensive group. This evidence confirms the existence of a rare marker revealed by dermatoglyphics in patients with hypertension, demonstrating the use of dermatoglyphics as an additional parameter in identifying individuals with this disease.

AB Objective: An early diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) improves outcome. Therefore, PE should be diagnosed in Emergency Care Units (ECU) at admission. Clinical algorithms support the clinician in this task, although performance is biased by differences in risk factors prevalent in different populations. The clinical conditions predictive of PE were evaluated in subjects from Southern Italy accessing ECU for dyspnea/chest pain.
   Methods: Retrospective clinical data were obtained by electronic retrieving from a hospital database. Data from 8177 patients (age 18-90 years, 54 with PE) were collected from years 2007-2013.
   Results: Previous history of PE, thrombosis and/or phlebitis, rheumatic diseases, respiratory failure, low blood pressure, pulse oxymetry rate (SpO(2)) and high heart rate were associated with PE diagnosis. High white blood count with neutrophilia, C reactive protein, D-dimer, NT-pro-BNP determinations, but not troponin T, were associated with PE. Recalibration of the GENEVA score and its modification, by inclusion of novel risk factors, improved the algorithm performance (GENEVA AROC=0.730, modified GENEVA AROC = 0.792, DeLong's test p = <0.001).
   Conclusions: PE risk factors in a large Sicilian sample are similar to those of other populations. Data from clinical history and clinical features present at admission were used to recalibrate the PE diagnostic algorithm showing that PE predictive power improved by fitting local data into the predictive model.

AB Aims: To determine the frequency of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in patients with coronary artery disease and to what degree the extent of coronary artery disease and presence of certain risk factors can be indicators of carotid artery stenosis in asymptomatic patients.
   Material and methods: Retrospective evaluation of consecutive patients that underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) during one year without symptoms or signs of carotid artery stenosis. The pre-operative Doppler ultrasonography in color and B-mode, using Siemens Accuson Antares machine, was used to determine the presence and the degree of carotid artery stenosis. Patients were divided according to the presence of significant (>= 50%) carotid artery stenosis. The same doctor performed all examinations. Following variables were analysed: age, gender, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, cholesterol, triglycerides and echocardiographic variables obtained from transthoracic echocardiography - the presence of aortic wall sclerosis, aortic valve sclerosis and mitral valve calcification.
   Results: We have demonstrated that in 18/272 (7.1%) of patients referred to CABG with hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenosis had asymptomatic stenosis. The risk of presence of carotid artery stenosis was more significant in those older than 60 years (OR 2.58 ;95% CI 0.98-6.77, p=0.047) and in patients with left main coronary artery stenosis (OR 8.92; 95% CI 3.2-24.83, p<0.001). Other investigated variables had no significant influence (p>0.05).
   Conclusion: The presence of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is strongly associated with the presence of left main coronary artery stenosis and with age older than 60 years. Noninvasive screening for carotid disease is reasonable in these subgroups of patients referred to CABG.

AB Introduction: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic syndrome characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, tender points and fatigue. There are several studies suggesting a possible relationship between musculoskeletal pain and vitamin D deficiency. In this study, we aimed to compare serum vitamin D levels between fibromyalgia patients and control groups and investigate the relationship between vitamin D and clinical findings on patients with fibromyalgia syndrome.
   Materials and methods: This case control study enrolled 79 women with fibromyalgia who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria and 80 healthy women. All subjects were evaluated with vitamin D and other biochemical markers. The patients were divided into three groups based on their serum vitamin D levels (normal, insufficient, deficient). Visual analogue scale and fibromyalgia impact questionnaire were used to evaluate the patients with FMS.
   Results: Mean serum vitamin D levels were lower in the FMS group than in the controls (12.99 +/- 8.37 ng/ml vs.16.05 +/- 9.42 ng/ml, p=0.037). Vitamin D level was significantly negative correlated with visual analogue scale, tender point count and fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (p=0.000, r=-0.578; p=0.001, r=-0.361; p=0.000, r=-0.621).
   Conclusion: It was concluded that vitamin D deficiency may be related to the clinical findings in patients with FMS.

AB Aim: Several studies have investigated serum ferritin levels in patients with chronic liver diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatitis and cirrhosis. However, there is no data on serum ferritin levels in patients with hepatitis D virus (HDV)-related cirrhosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether there are differences in serum ferritin levels among patients with HBV-related cirrhosis, HDV-related cirrhosis and healthy subjects.
   Materials and methods: Thirty-one patients with HBV-related cirrhosis, 33 patients with HDV-related cirrhosis, and 51 healthy controls were included in the study. Serum iron parameters including serum iron (SI), total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and ferritin were measured in these groups.
   Results: The average serum ferritin levels of patients with HDV-related cirrhosis, HBV-related cirrhosis and controls were 173.7 +/- 161.3, 168.2 +/- 165.1 and 86.3 +/- 58.4; respectively. The HBV-related cirrhosis and HDV-related cirrhosis groups had higher ferritin levels than the control group. However, there were no statistically significant differences between patients with HBV-related cirrhosis and control groups and HDV-related cirrhosis and HBV-related cirrhosis (all, p>0.05). On the contrary, comparison between HDV-related cirrhosis and control group was statistically significant (p=0.004).
   Conclusions: HBV and HDV-related cirrhosis patients had higher ferritin levels and lower total iron binding capacity (TIBC) than healthy controls. The presence of HDV-related cirrhosis affects serum ferritin levels. Therefore, increased ferritin levels may play a role in the pathogenesis HDV-related cirrhosis.

AB Introduction: Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a natural glycoprotein, which plays important roles on regulation and development of vascular calcification, is a key regulator molecule in bone turnover. Studies revealed different results about effects of vitamin D receptor activators (VDRAs) on OPG levels. This study investigated the changes in serum OPG levels and its relationships following VDRAs, paricalcitol and calcitriol treatments, in hemodialysis patients.
   Materials and methods: Thirty-two hemodialysis patients (14 women, 18 men) were included the study. Demographics and ongoing treatments of patients were recorded. Paricalcitol and calcitriol treatments were initiated randomly. Serum OPG levels, biochemical and hematological tests were measured at baseline and 3th month of the treatment.
   Results: There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of demographics and basal laboratory tests. No difference was found between paricalcitol and calcitriol groups regarding change from baseline and percent change in biochemical markers and OPG levels. Significant increase in calcium (Ca) levels (p=0.025 vs 0.001), significant decreases in parathyroid hormone (PTH) (p=0.001 vs 0.039) and OPG (p=0.001 vs 0.006) levels were noted at 3th month compared to baseline in paricalcitol and calcitriol group.
   Conclusion: VDRAs, paricalcitol and calcitriol, both decreased OPG levels in hemodialysis patients. No difference was noted between two therapeutic agents regarding their effects on OPG levels. These findings should be confirmed by further large-scale studies.

AB Introduction: Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients under maintenance hemodialysis (HD) treatment. Seeking factors associated with IDH may provide clinically relevant information.
   Materials and method: We enrolled a total of 103 patients receiving thrice-weekly HD. Besides hemodynamic and laboratory parameters, we evaluated nutritional status, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms.
   Results: Female subjects had a significantly higher rate of IDH compared to males (42.6% vs. 14.9%, p=0.003). Older patients (>= 65 years old) tended to have a higher rate of IDH compared to those younger than 65 years, but the difference was not statistically significant (31% vs. 21%, p=0.2). Univariate correlation analysis revealed gender, orthostatism, history of falls, dialysis duration, fasting glucose, albumin, and potassium levels to be correlated with IDH. Logistic regression analysis revealed that higher potassium level was the only independent factor in association with IDH.
   Conclusion: We observed an independent association between higher predialysis potassium levels and IDH. Further studies are needed to confirm this association and to see if measures to control predialysis potassium levels better would translate into a decreased rate of IDH in these patients.

ID MICROCARCINOMA
AB Aim: This study is conducted to identify clinical significance of multicentricity and its effects on thyroid papillary carcinoma.
   Materials and methods: Hospital records of 250 patients who were operated and diagnosed as thyroid papillary carcinoma according to pathology report between 2000-2007 in Ankara Oncology Hospital were analyzed retrospectively.
   Results: Among the 250 paitents who were diagnosed with thyroid papillary carcinoma and followed 1025 mounts in average, multicentricity was identified in the 43.2% of the patients. Multicentricity was detected in 57.1% (32 patients) of the 56 patients who had follicular variant of thyroid papillary carcinoma which was detected in their pathology report. In comparison with other subgroups, multicentricity was seen in a higher statistical rate in follicular variant. However, a statistically significant relation between them could not be founded (p:0.06). Among the 13 multicentric patients, vascular invasion was seen in 10 patients (76.9%) and there was a statistical correlation (p<0.05). Although multicentricity was seen in 46.8% (36 patients) of the 78 patients with lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis, there was not a statistical correlation. 34 patients had recurrence and multicentricity was seen in 19 of them (55.9%) with no statistical relation. Moreover, no correlation of multicentricty with general survival and disease-free survival was found.
   Discussion: Multicentricity characterized with high recurrence rate and lymph node metastasis should be accepted as a bad prognostic factor and in this situation aggressive treatment protocol should be used.

AB Introduction: Chlamydia trachomatis infection is the most common sexually transmitted disease and it represents a major public health problem in women of reproductive age. Chlamydia infection during pregnancy poses major health risks for both pregnant women and their fetuses. Most of the individuals who are infected by C. trachomatis are asymptomatic. This treatable disease can be detected easily and more precisely thanks to new developing diagnostic technologies. Application of screening programs in which highly sensitive methods such as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) could be beneficial in asymptomatic populations.
   Materials and methods: Genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection prevalence in asymptomatic Turkish women, who presented for initial prenatal visit or preconception visit at Anadolu Medical Center in western part of Turkey (Istanbul), between 2006 and 2011, was investigated by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Endocervical specimens collected from 541 women during their vaginal examination were analyzed by COBAS Amplicor Chlamydia trachomatis test. Two hundred fifty nine women were tested during the first visit of their pregnancy, while 282 women were tested during preconception visit. The median age of the women was 30 years, range 16 to 45 years.
   Results: Totally 1.85% (n= 10) of the patients were positive. Of the positive patients, 20% (n= 2) were pregnant, while 80% (n= 8) were in preconception period. Genital Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence was determined as 1.85% in asymptomatic Turkish women population.
   Conclusion: Chlamydia trachomatis screening in asymptomatic sexually active women should be performed by highly sensitive NAAT tests. Screening of women in reproductive age may reduce major health risks for pregnant women and their newborns; further investigations that will contribute diagnosis of the disease and the determination of national strategies should be performed.

AB Objective: In this study we aimed to determine the effect of RDW on mortality by comparing the temporal changes in RDW level in deceased and surviving ICU patients.
   Materials and method: This study was retrospectively conducted in 776 patients admitted to intensive care unit between 01.01.2013 and 31.12.2013. Age, sex, clinical diagnosis, comorbid conditions, RDW levels at intensive care admission and discharge, duration of intensive care stay, and mortality rate were evaluated. Kolmogorov Smirnov, student t-test, Mann Whithey u test, and Chi-square test were used for data analysis. The results were provided at a confidence interval of 95% and a significance level of p<0.05.
   Results: Conducted on 776 patients in Ankara Numune Hospital's general intensive care clinic 3, this study revealed a mortality rate of 38.2%. The mean age of the study population was 65.4+/-18.3 years, with the deceased patients having a greater mean age (p<0.05). Four hundred and thirteen (53.2%) patients were male, and there was no significant difference between the ratios of both genders (p>0.05). The deceased patients had significantly increasing RDW levels whereas the surviving patients had significantly reducing RDW levels (p<0.05). There was a significant correlation between the magnitude of RDW increment and duration of hospital stay in the deceased patients (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that RDW, with known association with mortality, can be used as a simple marker for patient follow-up and monitorization of effectiveness of the administered therapies in ICU.

AB Introduction: Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas strains lead to serious and nosocomial infections in intensive care units (ICUs) and the other clinics. Resistance of these bacteria against to antibiotics, in particular is emerging as a very significant in intensive care units. The factors which affect the increase in resistance to antimicrobial drugs are the high probability of encountering antimicrobial resistant microorganisms and empiric antimicrobial treatment.
   Materials and methods: The bacterial culture results of clinical specimens sent to Microbiology Laboratory of Mustafa Kemal University Hospital in five year period were examined retrospectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacteria of genus Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from these specimens were analyzed. The antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter strains isolated from ICUs and those isolated from other clinics was compared.
   Results: In five-year period, 772 P. aeruginosa and 971 Acinetobacter spp. were isolated from the specimens. Twenty-three percent of P. aeruginosa strains and 49.3% of Acinetobacter spp. were isolated from the patients in intensive care units. 628 (64.7%) of Acinetobacter and 92 (11.9%) of P. aeruginosa strains were found to be Multidrug Resistant (MDR). The ratios of multidrug-resistance in Acinetobacter strains isolated from the patients in ICUs were found to be higher than those in P. aeruginosa strains isolated from the patients in intensive care units. MDR ratio of these bacteria isolated in ICUs was higher than that isolated in the other clinics.
   Conclusion: Acinetobacter strains isolated from the patients in ICUs were determined to be more resistant than those isolated from the patients in other clinics while Pseudomonas strains isolated from the other clinics, were more resistant than those isolated from the patients hospitalized in ICUs. The ratio of MDR bacteria was higher in ICUs than that in other clinics.

AB Introduction: Diarrhea is a commonly encountered complication in critically ill patients. It causes fluid and electrolyte loss, increases the workload of nurses, and prolongs the duration of hospitalization. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the incidence and risk factors associated with nosocomial diarrhea in adult patients treated in intensive care unit (ICU).
   Materials and methods: Records of 786 adult patients treated in the ICU between January 2004 and May 2009 were inspected retrospectively. Loose or watery stools occurring three times a day and more was considered as diarrhea. The control group included those patients who were treated in ICU at the same time as the patients with diarrhea, with similar demographic and clinic features.
   Results: It was established that of 786 patients, 78 (9.92%) developed diarrhea. The time lapse between admission to the ICU and the onset of diarrhea was 12.41 +/- 21.7 days, and the duration of diarrhea was 438 +/- 2.13 days. Compared to the control's (n=80), the rate of enteral feeding was higher in patients with diarrhea, enteral nutrition products of high concentration, proton pump inhibitors, medications containing sorbitol and Mg+2, clindamycin, and cephalosporins were used significantly more often (p=0.002, p=0.006, p=0.048, p=0.006, p=0.033, p=0.048). Furthermore, the length of stay in ICU was longer in these patients (p=0.043). Clostridium difficile toxin was determined to be positive in 11 patients with diarrhea (14.1%). These cases were older and had a longer ICU stay and duration of diarrhea (p=0.031, p=0.027, p=0.004).
   Conclusion: It was found that the patients with diarrhea had a high enteral nutrition infusion rate, and products concentration, a high level of drug usage such as proton pump inhibitors, antibiotics, and sorbitol, and a low albumin level. Nosoconzial diarrhea could also prolong the length of ICU stay in critically ill patients.

AB Introduction: Changes in lifestyle are recommended to all diabetics and consist of medical nutrition therapy and physical exercise programs. There has been growing evidence that the Mediterranean diet plays a role in medical nutrition therapy. This study aimed to determine the effects of the Mediterranean diet on the estimated 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetics.
   Materials and methods: This trial is an open, nonrandomized clinical trial. Participants consumed a Mediterranean diet for 12 weeks. The cardiovascular disease risk score of each individual was calculated before and after the dietary intervention, without any change in his or her medical treatments throughout the study.
   Results: A total of 254 patients were screened. Thirty-two patients were excluded from the study before and 20 patients after the dietary intervention. Therefore, 202 patients completed the study. We obtained a significant reduction in cardiovascular disease risk score of 245 +/- 3.6% in men and 20.0 +/- 3.5% in women (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the efficacy of the Mediterranean diet for reducing cardiovascular diseases risk in type 2 diabetics in 12 weeks.

TI SERUM ISCHEMIA MODIFIED ALBUMIN LEVELS IN SUBCLINICAL CUSHING'S SYNDROME
SO ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA

   syndrome; oxidative stress
ID ADRENAL INCIDENTALOMA
AB Introduction: Subclinical Cushing's syndrome (SCS) is defined as biochemical overt cortisol excess in the absence of the classical signs and symptoms of Cushing's disease. The prevalence of SCS is reported as between approximately 5% and 24% in patients with adrenal incidentalomas (AI). SCS has increased cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, and metabolic syndrome. Recently some studies demonstrated oxidative stress enhancement in Cushing's disease. Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) is a marker of ischemia and oxidative stress and is increased in different clinical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome. However, it has not been investigated in the patients with SCS. We aimed to evaluate serum IMA levels in the patients with SCS.
   Materials and methods: A total of 128 patients with AI were included in this study (17 patients with SCS and 111 patients with non-functional adenomas (NFA)). All patients were evaluated for the presence of adrenal masses using adrenal computed tomography (CT) scans. Serum IMA levels were measured by using a calorimetric method.
   Results: Serum IMA levels were significantly higher in SCS patients than in NFA patients (p < 0.05). Serum IMA was significantly correlated with waist circumference, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and SCS. Furthermore, regression analysis revealed that serum IMA levels are independent and positively associated only with SCS.
   Conclusion: We concluded that elevated serum IMA levels might be accepted as a useful marker in patients with SCS. In order to reveal the pathological role of IMA levels in patients with SCS more studies are required.

AB Introduction: The combination of clinical probability assessment and the D-dimer test has been recommended to avoid unnecessary diagnostic testing in pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). However, in clinical practice, patients are occasionally diagnosed with PTE despite normal D-dieter levels. In the present study, we reviewed the characteristics of cases in an emergency department (ED) in which a diagnosis of PTE was made despite normal D-dimer test results.
   Materials and methods: The hospital records of 107 patients who were admitted to the ED of a teaching hospital and diagnosed with PTE between January 2011 and December 2013 were reviewed retrospectively. We acquired data for 11 patients (10.2%) in whom D-dimer measurements obtained by an automated latex turbidimetric quantitative method were below 500 ng/ml (0-450).
   Results: Of the 11 patients, 72.7% (8/11) were female, and mean age was 71. +/- 57.9 (61-84) years. The most common symptom was dyspnea (54.5%, n=6). The mean delay between onset of symptoms and admission to the ED was 10.6 (3-30) days, and follow-ups were performed for patients in other health facilities for various causes of dyspnea. When risk factors were analyzed with the Wells score, 18.2% (2/11) of patients had low probability of PTE, whereas 72.7% (8/11) had intermediate, and 9% (1/11) had high probability. According to the revised Geneva score, 18.2% (2/11) of patients were found to have low probability, and 81.8% (9/11) had intermediate probability. The Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index score classified 18.2% (2/11) of the patients in the low risk group, and the European Society of Cardiology classification classified 81.8% (9/11) in the low risk group.
   Conclusion: In patients with nonspecific symptoms of PTE, the delay between onset of symptoms and admission to the ED is important. The risk factors of the patients and their pre-test probabilities should be considered along with D-dieter test results.

AB Aim: Platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) was revaled to have a close relation with major adverse cardiovascular outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between PLR and lesion localization of left anterior descending artery (LAD) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients.
   Materials and methods: Patients admitted to our hospital with acute anterior STEMI were included. 58 patients who have single-vessel disease at LAD and their hematological parameters were analyzed retrospectively. Proximal segment of LAD lesions were groupped as Group I and mid segment of the LAD lesion groupped as Group II. The groups were compared according to their PLR and other parameters.
   Results: Between group I (n = 41, mean age 52.5 +/- 12.7) and group 11 (n = 17, mean ages 52.0 +/- 10.8); PLR, was significantly higher in group I (159 +/- 99 vs 99.5 +/- 37.5 p < 0.05). In group I, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly lower (P = 0.02). In correlation analyzes, PLR was positively correlated with Troponin I (r = 0.30, P = 0.03) and negatively correlated with LVEF (r= - 0.27, P = 0.04)
   Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that anterior STEMI patients with high PLR had a greater possibility having proximal culprit lesion on the LAD. Therefore PLR can be used as a useful tool to detect not only significant atherosclerosis but also culprit plaque localization in patients with acute STEMI patients.

AB Introduction: Acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most common causes of abdominal pain and emergent abdominal surgery. The incidence is approximately 10% during the lifetime. Although appendectomy is a most common surgical procedure worldwide, it's complication rate is 5-28% A delay in diagnosis of AA is associated with prolonged hospitalization, an increased rate of perforation (34%-75%), wound infection (0%-11%), pelvic abscess (1%-5%) and late intro-abdominal adhesions. Appendectomy is first described by McBurney in 1894 and still remains the standart procedure for AA. Although patients with AA often present with a characteristic symptom complex and physical findings, atypical presentations are common. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients who were operated for suspected acute appendicitis and to assess the discriminative effect of this ratio between wzinflamed, uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis.
   Materials and methods: The medical records of 3212 patients who underwent appendectomy for suspected acute appendicitis during a 10-year period were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were divided into 3 groups; group 1, 208 consecutive patients who had uninflamed appendix at appendectomy; group 2, 2111 consecutive patients who had uncomplicated acute appendicitis at appendectomy; group 3, 893 patients who had complicated appendicitis (perforated appendix or peri-appendicular abscess) at appendectomy. Data for three groups of patients were analyzed to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the NLR in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Receivers operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate this ratio in a relation with true diagnosis and severity of acute appendicitis.
   Results: 1792 (55.8%) of the patients were male and 1420 (44.2%) of them were female. The mean age of the groups were 30.28 +/- 14.18, 29.98 +/- 12.63 and 33.81 +/- 16.27 respectively. The discriminative effect of NLR was higher between uninflamed and complicated appendicitis groups with a cut-off value of 3,94. The recommended cut-off value of the preoperative NLR was decided using ROC curve analyses. The recommended cut-off value of the NLR was based on the most prominent point on the ROC curve for sensitivity (82.2%) and specificity (56.5%). The area under the ROC curve was 0.74.
   Conclusion: AA is one of the most common surgical emergencies and the most common source of infection in community acquired intra-abdominal infections. However the diagnosis is often challenging and the decision to operate, observe or further work-up on a patient is often unclear. Initial management of patients with suspected AA is based on the history of the patient, physical examination, basic laboratory tests reflecting the inflammatory response and radiologic imaging. NLR is a helpful biochemical parameter for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis but it has limited value on differentiating patients with complicated appendicitis from patients with uninflamed and uncomplicated appendicitis.

AB Introduction: This study aimed to investigate relationships among serum nitric oxide (NO) concentrations, total oxidant-antioxidant capacities (TOC-TAC), serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanin Aminotransferase (ALT) and hematological parameters in Brucella seropositive (serum samples positive for Brucella) and seronegative (serum samples negative for Brucella) human serum samples.
   Materials and methods: Eighty positive and 20 negative human sera to Brucella Serum Tube Agglutination Test were used for determination of NO, TOC-TAC, CRP, AST, ALT.
   Results: Serum TOC concentrations were significantly (P<0.01) higher in Brucella seropositive titers compared to Brucella seronegative serum samples regardless of titers. However, there was no difference among different seropositive titers for serum TOC concentrations. In contrast, no effect of Brucella antibody titers on serum NO, TAC, CRP, AST and ALT levels was proved. However, AST concentration tended to be (P<0.07) higher at 1/640 titer. While Brucella antibody titers decreased leukocyte (P<0.05) and increased erythrocyte (P<0.05) counts at 1/640 titers with no change at 11160 and 1/320 titers, no effect of Brucella antibody titers was detected on thrombocyte counts. There was a positive correlation between Brucella antibody titers and TOC (r=0,44; P<0,01), AST (r=0,23; P=0,05) levels and erythrocyte counts (r=0,32; P<0,01); whereas, there was a negative correlation between Brucella antibody titers and leukocyte counts (r=-0.32; P<0,01).
   Conclusion: The increase in TOC levels and steady state levels of TAC could reveal that antioxidant system was efficient during the course of brucellosis. Furthermore, determination of TOC/TAC system along with hematological and inflammatory parameters may be helpful monitoring and better understanding the pathogenesis of brucellosis.

AB Background: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common pediatric disability causing long-term functional limitations. CP remarkably influences the life of those affected and their families. For this reason it is important and necessary to direct attention not only type of the CP, but also the impact the disorder has on the child, parents, siblings and the entire family as a whole. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of CP on the child's quality of life, considering parents' perceptions about their child's illness, in order to underline the impact the illness has not only on the child but also his/her family.
   Methods: The study included both parents of the 36 subjects enrolled (19 males and 17 females), with established CP diagnosis. The effect of CP on the families was assessed using the Impact of Childhood Illness Scale. This questionnaire assesses the quality of life in children with epilepsy and other chronic pathologies and in their families. All questions refer to effect to the illness family. The scale comprises 30 questions divided into four sections: impact of illness and its treatment; impact on development and child s adjustment; impact on parents and impact on the family. Descriptive analyses were used for data analysis and it is also calculated the rank correlation coefficient Spearman's rho.
   Results and conclusion: The mothers' group presents little higher average scores than the group of fathers in two four subscales or in the basement "Impact on the child" and "Family impact on the organization". This could be due to the fact that mothers are concerned most of the child's caregiver, living most of all the difficulties that entails; mothers show greater concerns than fathers. In subscale "Impact on parents" the average score of the answers of the group of mothers coincide with that of the fathers; the experience and the experience of his son's illness is analogous for both parents. No significant differences were found from the correlational analysis between the individual items of the subscales and the different forms of CP. In families of children with CP, strategies for optimizing caregiver physical and psychological health include supports for behavioral management and daily functional activities as well as stress management and self-efficacy techniques.

AB Introduction: Psoriasis vulgaris (PV) is characterized by erythrosquamous plaques in skin and associated with systemic inflammation. Platelets modulate immune and inflammatory processes in the skin. Platelets are indicated with PCT which is produced of PLT and the MPV and reflects total platelet mass. PCT is found as a marker that shows platelet activity. PCT is associated with severity of inflammation in some diseases. NLR and PLR in venous blood are increased in systemic inflammatory responses. We aimed to investigate the association between Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and platelet indices including plateletcrit (PCT), the value of platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV) and the value of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR).
   Materials methods: A total of 172 patients with psoriasis and 128 healthy controls were included in the study. Age, sex, PCT, PLR, NLR, PASI, PLT, neutrophil count (NC) and lymphocyte count (LC), MPV, lipid profile of the patients were recorded. We measured the severity of skin disease using PASI.
   Results: When compared with controls, patients with psoriasis had higher PCT, platelet count, MPV, PLR and NLR. We observed significant association between the presence of psoriasis and PCT, NLR, MPV. There were significant differences between platelet indices including PLT, PCT, MPV, PLR in the severe and moderate groups. PASI was positively correlated with PCT, MPV and PLR. In ROC analysis, PCT value greater than 0.321 predicted psoriasis with 55% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Using binary logistic regression analysis, we found that PCT, especially those values > 0.321, were independent predictors of psoriasis (OR= 2.810, 95% Cl= 1.28-3.33, p= 0.000).
   Conclusion: PCT value should be used as a predictor for precense of psoriasis. It could also be highlighted that PCT is a noninvasive, easily available marker and so it can be used in predicting patients with psoriasis.

AB Introduction: The brain needs a continuous supply of O-2 and its deficiency may interfere with cognitive function. It has been observed that, during the performance of a maximal exercise, in the central nervous system (CNS) increases the use of lactate and glucose. Moreover; it has been described that during a maximal exercise the increase of blood lactate is associated with a worsening of attentive processes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether high levels of Lactate are capable of influencing other cognitive domains as Short-term memory.
   Materials and methods: Fifteen male and healthy athletes participated in the research. Short-term memory span was carried through the Italian computerized version of Wechsler's Digit Span. The subjects were asked to perform an incremental cycling test on a mechanically braked cycloergometer. The measurement of values of blood lactate and the assessment of Short-term memory through the Italian computerized version of Wechsler's Digit Span were performed in three specific moments: 1) at rest (before); 2) immediately after performing an exhaustive exercise (end); 3) 10 minutes after the end of the exercise (10 min).
   Results: Blood lactate levels increased ftom 1.5 mmol/l (+/- 0.21) at rest (pre), to 12.0 mmol/l (+/- 2.14) immediately after the exercise (end), and decreased to 1.6 mmol/l (+/- 0.21) 10 min after its conclusion (post). In parallel, we observed that the digit span shows a worsening of short term memory at the end of exercised and returned to the pre-exercise values within 10 min after the conclusion of exercise.
   Conclusion: The present results show that high levels of blood lactate, as those induced with an exhaustive exercise, influence the cognitive domain of the memory in the same way observed for the cognitive domain of attention.

AB Background and aim: Among various soils pollutants, heavy metals have great importance due to their toxicity and adverse effect on human health and environment. Therefore the aim of this study is comparing the concentration of heavy metals in surface soil of squares with high traffic at Kermanshah metropolises in 2015.
   Materials and methods: For conducting this study, five high traffic area and five area as a reference soil were selected and from each location, five samples were collected. Finally a total of 50 point sample and 10 composite samples were obtained from these areas. The concentration of metals were evaluated based on the standard methods with ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma) device.
   Results: The results showed that the level of heavy metals in high traffic area and reference's soil samples were as bellow: Lead (Pb) > Nickel (Ni) > Chromium (Cr) > Vanadium (V) > Cadmium (Cd) > Selenium (Se). Also, the level of Cr, Cd and Ni in high traffic area were higher than references soil area.
   Conclusion: According to the results, it is necessary to take some action for controlling the pollutants emission from mobile sources in high traffic area in order to reduce the heavy metals emission in the environment.

AB Background and aim: Disinfection is a process in which pathogenic microorganisms of Abiotic surfaces are disappeared. Choosing a suitable disinfectant and using standard methods of disinfection can be effective in reducing nosocomial infections. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of newly market disinfectants with commonly used disinfectants in Iran in reducing hospital infections index: Case study of Kermanshah hospitals.
   Materials and methods: In this descriptive analytical study, a total of 450 microbial samples were randomly taken from different parts of Kermanshah hospitals. In microbiology lab of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, all the samples were cultured on blood agar medium and the specific culture medium for each bacteria was used. In this study, three new disinfectants supplied to the market including Sayaspt HI, Turbo septi, 50 Deconex AF were compared with commonly-used disinfectants including Sayasept HP, Deconex 53 plus and DeconexSolarsept. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, independent two-group T-test and chi-square test.
   Results: In examining the effectiveness of new and current disinfectants in surveyed hospitals, it was observed that the average of overall performance of common disinfectants was 96.7 % and the average of overall performance of new disinfectants was 98.5 % in reducing the indicators of hospital infections. Among large surface disinfection Deconex 50 AF had the highest performance in reducing nosocomial infection; and among small surfaces disinfection septi Turbo had the highest performance in reducing nosocomial infection. Also among equipment and materials disinfection Sayasept HI had the highest performance in reducing nosocomial infection.
   Conclusion: According to the results, to disinfect tools and equipment Sayasept HI is proposed. To disinfect large surfaces 50 Deconex AF is recommended and to disinfect small surfaces DeconexSolarsept is suggested.

AB Introduction: This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori and its relationship with age and sex through endoscopic diagnosis results of the general population and constables of Istanbul, Turkey.
   Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis was performed for 14,500 patients' biopsy results taken from the antrum and corpus during gastroscopies for various reasons.
   Results: In 10,266 (70.8%) of the 14,500 patients that underwent gastroscopic antrum and corpus biopsies, there was a positive result for Helicobacter pylori (70.8%). Helicobacter pylori was more prevalent in constables (72%). The difference between age groups for the general population and the constables was significant for Helicobacter pylori positivity (p < 0.001). For constables, there was a difference between the sexes for Helicobacter pylori prevalence (p = 0.002), whereas other patients had no significant difference (p = 0.238). Constables had higher prevalences for gastritis (p = 0.001), gastric ulcers (p < 0.001), duodenal ulcers (p < 0.001), and esophagitis (p < 0.001) than non-constables.
   Conclusion: Helicobacter pylori prevalence for endoscopic antrum and corpus biopsies of the general population was 70.8%. The Helicobacter pylori prevalence for constables was higher than the other segments of this society. Age was determined to be a significant variable both among constables and the general population, however, sex differences were only evident for the constables.

AB Megaureter is a medical anomaly whereby the ureter is abnormally dilated. Regardless of the cause of megaureter (reflux or obstruction), megaureters are treated to prevent urinary tract infection and possible kidney damage. Sonographic characteristics and percutaneous catheter drainage of thigh abscesses in selected patients are described. In this study we try to evaluate and define the usefulness of DRUS in predicting the outcome of patient who presented with megaureter whom the vesicoureteral reflux has been ruled out. Relationship between DRUS findings and final outcome analyzed. For this purpose 284 patients (357 megaureters) for 15 years (2000-2015) with primary mega ureter are tested. Laboratory data such as routine complete blood count and urine analysis, creatinine level is obtained. Then statistical analysis was performed using the Social Sciences software. Results after treatment and placement of drainage shows that diameter of ureter can be decreased about 4.3+/-4.6 mm. Also, decrease in diameter of ureter observed in 72.8% of non-obstructing mega ureter while the same only observed in 27% obstructing mega ureter.

AB Introduction: Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is a common type of pediatric idiopathic generalized epilepsy, characterized by multiple seizures of typical absence, with typical EEG pattern consisting in bilateral synchronous and symmetrical discharges of generalized 3 Hz spike-wave (SWDs).
   Recently, some researchers have suggested that the underlying epileptogenic mechanism of absence seizures selectively involves the frontal cortical circuits, also supported by video-electroencephalography data(3). These data may be considered as a new window in CAE comprehension and management, particularly about symptoms different from seizure that children affected may present.
   In this light, aim of the present study is evaluating the presence of internalizing problems in prepubertal children affected by CAE.
   Material and methods: 18 patients (10 females, 8 males) ranging age from 8-11 years (mean age 9.36 +/- 1.32) affected by typical CAE were recruited. Control group was composed by 43 subjects (32 females, 11 males) (mean age 8.54 +/- 2.01). All subjects were screened for internalizing symptoms with SAFA-A scale and CDI test.
   Results: The two groups were comparable for age (p= 0.117) and sex distribution (p= 0.251). CAE children showed significantly higher score than controls for anxiety (p< 0.001) and depressive symptoms screening tests (p< 0.001) (Table 1).
   Conclusions: Results of present study suggest the importance of screening for anxiety and depressive signs in CAE children, in order to optimize their management beyond the exclusive idea to control and stop epileptic seizure only.

AB Introduction: ADHD is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, or a combination of these symptoms. Sleep disorders may be considered as a not secondary underlying cause of ADHD and growing evidence evidenced that obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) symptoms may overlap ADHD's ones.
   Aim of the present study is verifying the presence of ADHD-like symptoms in other frequent condition such as sleep-related breathing disorders in pediatric age.
   Materials and methods: 34 children (19 males and 15 females) aged 6-10 years (mean age 9.706 +/- 3.434) with polysomnographic diagnosis of OSA, according to ICSD-3 criteria, were recruited. Control group was composed by 89 typical developing children (47 males, 42 females) (mean age 9,528 +/- 3,351). The Conners' Rating Scale-Revised (CRS-R) test was administered to mothers to assess their children's behavior.
   Results: The two groups are comparable for age (p = 0.794) and sex distribution (p = 0.918). Subjects affected by OSA present higher scores in pathological range in all scales of CRS-R than controls (Table 1).
   Conclusions: Scientific and clinical evidences tend to stress the similarities between ADHD and OSA effects/comorbidities in pediatric age, suggesting sleep screening as mandatory before starting stimulant drugs treatment.

AB Introduction: Borderline intellectual functioning (BIF) children comprises a group of subjects whit intelligence quotient (IQ) ranging 71-85, with a prevalence about 13.6%. Several studies pinpointed the role of parenting on BIF management.
   Aim of present study was evaluating with objective and validated tool the parental stress rate in mothers of an Italian sample of BIF children.
   Materials and methods: 26 BIF children (20 males and 6 females) aged 6-10 years (mean age 10.36 +/- 2.03), according to DSM-5 criteria, and 53 (42 males and 11 females) typical developing children (mean age 10.58 +/- 1.97) were recruited for present study. Mothers of all enrolled children underwent an evaluation with Parental Stress Index (PSI) test.
   Results: The two studied groups were comparable for age (p = 0.646) and gender (p = 0.956).
   Table 1 shows comparison between BIF and Control groups among PSI-SF scale results (Table 1), specifically mothers of BIF children have a significantly higher levels of global parental stress (p < 0.001), stress related to parenting (p < 0.001), stress linked to difficult child (p < 0.001) and stress related to parent-child interaction (p < 0.001) than mothers of control children. (Table 1)
   Conclusion: Several reports showed the key role of BIF as risk factor for psychiatric troubles and poor long-term adjustment. Our findings emphasize the need to approach this condition also from a family point of view, stressing that care should not be limited to child rehabilitative treatment but must also involve a family centered intervention.

AB Aflatoxins are amongst the major mycotoxins produced by various species of Aspergillus, particularly A. flavus and A. parasiticus. This study aims to study the effect of aflatoxin genes aflPand aflQ on aflatoxigenic species of A. flavus and A. parasiticus in cattle feed.
   To conduct the study, 121 samples of cattle feed were collected and then were isolated and cultured based on macroscopic and microscopic methods. Moreover, PCR technique was also used to undertake a molecular examination of the isolated Aspergillus. To identify the aflatoxigenic species, 10 Aspergillus fungi, containing one or two positive aflatoxin genes were randomly selected and examined under the ultraviolet light. Finally, their aflatoxin content was evaluated based on High Performance Liquid Chromatography.
   The results indicate that 55.37% of 121 samples of the cattle feeds contaminated by Aspergillus fungi. Among these isolated samples, 67.16% has aflP and 70.14% has aflQ, and the findings of HPLC also confirms that aflatoxigenic isolates are more common than their non-aflatoxigenic counterparts. Among 10 species of A. flavus and A. parasiticus collected from cattle feeds, wheat bran produced the highest amount of aflatoxin, in which aflatoxin B1 accounted for the highest amount and aflatoxins G1 and G2 accounted for the least amount. It is noteworthy that aflatoxin B1 was produced in all species while aflatoxin G2 was not produced. Aflatoxins B2 and G1 were produced in all species of A. parasiticus and some species of A. flavus.
   Controlling cattle feeds contaminated by Aspergillus fungi can secure them against aflatoxin contamination and prevent them from entering the human and animal health cycle.

ID PROVISIONAL REPORT; PARAMETERS; MORTALITY
AB Introduction: Increased waist circumference is an independent risk factor for cardio-vascular complications and mortality and current studies focus on describing the factors involved in its etiology and pathogeny.
   The objective of this study was to analyze all components of the metabolic syndrome in subjects with increased waist circumference, with the hypothesis that even in normal weighted apparently healthy subjects the metabolic profile is already modified.
   Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between February 2013 and April 2014. The sample consisted of 266 consecutive patients presenting to the Endocrinology Outpatient Clinic of the Emergency Mures County Hospital for consultation who signed the informed consent. Inclusion criteria - waist circumference above 80cm for females and >94cm for males. Exclusion criteria - secondary causes of increased abdominal circumference: pregnancy, generalized edema, endocrine causes: untreated hypo-or hyperthyroidism, Cushing syndrome, medications that could lead to weight gain/loss, weight losing diet and refusal to participate. For all patients, height, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure were measured by the same person. Venous blood samples were taken for determination of fasting blood glucose, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. Microsoft Office Excel was used for data collection and GraphPad Prism v. 5 for statistical analysis, with a level of significance alpha=0.05.
   Results: Mean age of the sample was 51 +/- 12.7 years with a median of 53 years and a sex ratio F:M of 8.1:1. The normal weighted subjects had a high prevalence of associated disturbances (34.41% hypertriglyceridemia, 37.63% low HDL cholesterol, 29.03% increased blood glucose and 44.09% hypertension). Metabolically healthy obese represented 17.29% (n=46) of the sample. When comparing the metabolically healthy subjects with abdominal obesity to the metabolically unhealthy subjects, the former are younger (41.4 vs. 53.1 years, p<0.0001), thinner (BMI 28.7 vs. 32.5 kg/sqm, p<0.0001) and with significantly smaller differences of the waist compared to the IDF cut-offs (11 vs. 20.2cm, p<0.0001).
   Conclusions: Waist circumference is an important clinical parameter which correlates with all the elements of the metabolic syndrome. Increased waist circumference should elicit metabolical evaluation and lifestyle modifications.

AB Introduction: The changes in the epidemiology of hospital admissions during this 13 year period may be due to influences from the changes in the age and sex of patients admitted to the hospital. To describe the characteristics of patients admitted to the Division of General Internal Medicine (DGIM) at a tertiary hospital in relation to age and sex.
   Material and methods: All hospital admission episodes of DGIM via the registry of the Basic Minimum Data Set at the Hospital General Universitario de Alicante (Spain) from January 2000 to December 2012 were analyzed. We examine the relationship between the main diagnosis, length of stay, and destination at discharge, we stratified the analyses by age (under 80, 80-90, over 90) and by sex (males and female).
   Results: 18,570 (4.8%) out of 387, 862 hospital discharges >14 years old had been admitted to the DGIM. The number of admissions to the DGIM increased from 1,362 in 2000 to 1,671 in 2012 (R2=0.632). The median age of admissions was 76.9 in 2000 and 813 in 2012 (p<0.001). Female median age was 80.5 years old, which was older than males (76.9; p<0.001). After adjusting for sex, octogenarians and nonagenarians had a greater risk of being admitted for respiratory system diseases, genitourinary system diseases, circulatory system diseases and infectious and parasitic diseases. After adjusting for age, females had a greater risk of being admitted for disorders of the blood-forming organs, endocrine disorders, and circulatory system diseases. With respect to age, there was a higher increase in mortality in 80-89 year old patients (13.1%), and especially in illnesses of patients >90 years old (22.0%; p<0.001).
   Conclusion: The profile for octogenarians and nonagenarians admitted to the DGIM and hospital mortality is different to that of younger people. The profile of hospitalization in females was different to that of males

AB Purpose and background: Trauma is one of the most important leading causes of death. According to the estimation of world health organization, accidents and traumatic patients are among the main causes of mortality. As rate of medical errors are high in evaluation of traumatic patients in stressful situations, ability to cope with the condition, high level of knowledge and accurate medical diagnosis are essential. Nurses, as big professional groups in health care systems, play a key role taking care of traumatic patients. In this study, we aimed to assess nursing students' level of background knowledge in Tabriz University of Medical Sciences (TUOMS) and Tabriz Azad Medical University (TAMU) in regard to trauma care.
   Materials and methods: After obtaining informed consent, 180 nursing students of TUOMS and TAMU were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. A questionnaire was completed for further evaluation of basic information about traumatic patients by each student.
   Findings: the results showed that there was no significant difference between two groups of students of National and Azad universities.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that the nursing student's level of knowledge in both universities of Tabriz is very low. These results highlight the necessity of appropriate training in this field for students.

AB Background: Cervical cancer is one of the commonest cancers in women worldwide. Cervical cancer screening is an effective strategy to reduce mortality, the uptake of screening, as a health seeking behavior, is very low among Iraq Kurdish women. Better understanding of the perceived barriers to cervical cancer screening is needed to find context-based explanation in order to find a blueprint to increase the screening rate.
   Objectives: The purpose of this study was to explore perceived barriers to cervical cancer screening from the viewpoint of Kurdish women from Kurdistan Region, Iraq.
   Materials and methods: The present study adopted a qualitative design based on a conventional content analysis approach. Purposive sampling was employed to choose 19 women who had either had a Pap smear or refused to have one. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were performed with each individual to collect the data.
   Results: Five main themes including awareness, belief, psychological factors, health system-related factors, and socio-cultural factors emerged during the data analysis.
   Conclusions: The findings of this study indicated that a combination of factors prevented women from cervical cancer screening in Kurdistan Region, Iraq. Understanding these factors may lead to the development of effective programs and policies to reduce these barriers and improve cervical cancer screening uptake.

AB Introduction: Knee pain is one of the most common complaints that caused patients visit their physician. Among all medical imaging technologies; using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is significant. The aim of this study was to determine the appropriateness of knee MRI prescription in Sabzevar Vasei hospital in 2014.
   Materials and methods: This study is descriptive and analytic, while the statistical population included 115 patients referred to MRI Unit in Sabzevar Vasei hospital, while they were selected randomly. A questionnaire was used for data collection and to determine the appropriateness of prescription; a local clinical guideline was used as well. Data analysis was done by using SPSS16, descriptive statistics, Spearman test, Pearson chi-square and Fisher exact tests.
   Results: Among 115 prescribed knee MRI patients, 52 prescriptions (45.2%) were inappropriate, 2 prescriptions (1.7%) were uncertain and 61 prescriptions (53%) were considered appropriate. The financial burden arising from inappropriate prescriptions was 39204000 Rials. Besides, there is a significant difference between the appropriate prescriptions and patients' gender, occupation, education, the specialty of a prescriber physician as well as referral institution (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Considering the high rate of inappropriate prescriptions, it is essential to find some reasons and to do continuous monitoring. The use of local clinical guidelines can improve the quality of the health system and avoid additional costs.

AB Introduction: Urbanization and rapid industrial development along with enumeration of population result in development of a variety of pollutants in the environment. The aim of this study is determination of the air's health status relying on AQI index in Dogonbadan City.
   Materials and methods: In this research, using the information provided by air quality monitoring stations of environmental protection organization of Dogonbadan City, the average concentration of air criteria pollutants (PM10, SO2, O-3, and NO2) during different months and seasons of 2012-2013 has been investigated. The obtained concentrations were then converted to AQI index using AQI calculator software. Further, the averageconcentration of the mentioned pollutants was compared with the country's environmental organization standards.
   Results: In general, during the years of 2012-2013, the air quality index was in a good and medium level (AQI<100) in 96% of cases, while in 4% of cases, it was beyond the standard limit. The PM10, SO2, O-3, and NO2 pollutants had the greatest and slightest rules in the air pollution of Dogonbadan City. August was the worst month in terms of PM10 pollution, since in this month 30% of pollution status had lied within the range of hazardous and above, whereas for other pollutants in this month, new unhealthy status was observed.
   Conclusions: Suspended particles were recognized as the major factor of air pollution in Dogonbadan City. Considering high levels of this pollutant, through timely notification, it is possible to prevent further complications for people with heart or lung diseases.

AB Background: Preeclampsia is a common cause of perinatal mortality. In severe cases, the magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is one of essential drugs. Administration of MgSO4 can prevent eclampsia and causes a reduction in fetal distress. The effect of MgSO4 on fetal circulation is a good explanation for this reduction in fetal distress. Color-Doppler ultrasound is an appropriate devicein order to evaluate circulation evaluation.
   Objective: This study was performed to evaluate the effect of magnesium sulfate on Doppler flow velocity parameters in the uterine arteries and fetal outcome.
   Methods: This prospective studyincluded 21 pregnant women with severe preeclampsia who were referred to Imam-Reza Hospital of Kermanshah. Before and afteradministration of MgSO4, Doppler ultrasound was performed to evaluate the uterine arteries blood flow. Newborns were under close observation after delivery. Data entry and statistical analysis were performed.
   Results: Significant difference was detected between resistant index (RI) of uterine artery before and after injection of magnesium sulfate (p<0.001). There was no significant correlation between maternal serum hemoglobin levels before delivery with gestational age and variation in RI (p=0.9 and 0.5, respectively).
   Conclusion: Administration of Magnesium sulfate changes Doppler flow velocimetry parameters andcauses the fetal perfusion improvement that can lead to reduction of fetal distress. Further studies and review of article are recommended.

AB Introduction: Caesarean rate in Iran increased recently, caesarean put mother and newborn in different situations and side effects like preterm labor andpreeclampsia.
   Objective: Our aim is studying last mother caesarean relationship with incidence of these conditions at second pregnancy.
   Methods: This Cohort study was carried out in pregnant women with gestational age of 28 weeks that referred to Imam Reza hospital in Kermanshah at 2014-2015. Thosewho had previous caesarean are placed at case group and those who had vaginal delivery placed at control group. Data had been analyzed with SPSS software version 18.
   Result: In this study 654 pregnant women that 218 of them had caesarean experience and 436 normal vaginal deliveries had been analyzed. The mother's average age in case group was 30/32and in control group was 29/01years and the mean gestational age for them was 38/26, 38/06 weeks respectively, preeclampsia was 83% in control group and 14/7% in case group, but preterm labor was 23/6% in controlgroup and 45/9% in case group (p<0/001).
   Conclusion: Result shows that there is a meaningful relationship between preeclampsia and pretermlaborwith previous caesarean history. We can say that caesarean can lead to these effects in subsequent pregnancies.

AB The physician-patient relationship is daily destabilized by emotional reactions and psychic defenses that cancer arises in the two partners. Continued scientific and technological progresses which were reached by medicine in recent years, and particularly oncologic clinical discoveries, increased the chance of not only survival but also healing. Nevertheless, cancer diagnosis is still a hard existential text that destabilizes everyday life, all the psychic and relational balance, inevitably causing a psychological and social change not only in the patient who is affected but also into the wide social network around him (family, friends, doctors, healthcare team.). The aim of this review is to understand how problems, feelings, emotions, distresses or defense mechanisms could garble the relation and the communication dynamics between physician and patients and then prejudicing the efficacy of oncologic therapeutic compliance. Pubmed and Scopus were searched, using strings related to "cancer", "physician-patient relations", burn-out", "compliance", and "communication", identifying literature published from 2000 to January 2015. Extracted papers were assessed for their relevance (10 of 412 papers initially reviewed). Results indicate that a good and empathetic relationship between physician and patient were related to good therapeutic adherence. In particular, a good physician-patient relation maximizes the impact of clinical therapies and reduces psychophysical implications.

AB The purpose of this statistical analysis is to demonstrate the real advantages in terms of cost-benefit of combination chemotherapy compared with single-agent chemotherapy. The trials, which are used in this meta-analysis, have been searched on PubMed database and they are phase II or randomized phase III studies with only chemotherapy regimens. In this meta-analysis were evaluated adverse effects with odds ratio (OR), which is expressed in 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Only 4 studies contained all the set selection criteria and they were selected. The data, which were obtained, were analyzed using MedCalc Application. The combination therapy was more strongly linked to certain adverse events than to chemotherapy with a single agent: thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia and nausea. The data obtained for leukopenia, for vomiting and for stomatitis are not statistically significant, as well as those of antitumor activity. Obtained data allow us to state that the overall combination therapy is more closely related to adverse effects such as thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia and nausea compared tosingle-agent chemotherapy.

AB Introduction: Sleep related breathing disorders (SRBD) consist of frequent and repetitive episodes of pharyngeal obstruction during sleep, with consequent intermittent hypoxia, sleep architecture fragmentation, daytime sleepiness and/or behavioural problems and executive impairment in children. When untreated, SRBD and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) mainly, may impact school performance, cognition, metabolism, and cardiovascular function.
   Aim of the present study is assessing the visuomotor integration skills in children affected by OSA.
   Materials and methods: 57 subjects affected by mild-to severe OSA, PSG diagnosed according to international diagnostic criteria, (31 males and 26 females) (mean age 10.8; SD +/- 2.49) and 83 healthy children (45 males and 38 females) (mean age 9.95; SD +/- 1.87; p = 0.725). All subjects underwent assessment of motor coordination skills with Movement-ABC tests and visual-motor integration ability with Visual Motor Integration (VMI) test.
   Results: The subjects with OSA show a worse average performances in all items of Movement ABC (p < 0.001) respect of controls. Specifically, children with OSAS show significantly higher values of total points (p < 0.001), manual dexterity (p < 0.001), ball skills (p < 0.001) and balance (p < 0.001). Accordingly, the average centile in OSA children at the MABC-test is significantly reduced compared with controls (p < 0.001). (Table 1) On the other hand, the VMI test evaluation among children with OSAS shows worst result in total Visuo-Motor Integration (p < 0.001), and in Motor Coordination sub-item (p < 0.001) than controls. (Table 1).
   Conclusion: Our results also support for children and adolescents the hypothesis that executive functioning deficits might be linked primarily to the degree of severity nocturnal hypoxemia rather than daytime sleepiness, although several other studies are needed.

AB Introduction: Zearalenone as mycoestrogen find in human food and animal food. Estrogenic properties depending on the Biotransformation level, in this regard, there are some reports of food contamination by mycotoxins such as ZEA. This study has investigated ZEA mycotoxin in edible oils.
   Materials and methods: 104 random samples of 8 different brands edible oil (corn, sunflower, mix) collected and evaluated from Kermanshah stores in 2013. Determination of ZEA levels was done by using high performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detector. Detection and quantification was limits of the method and order of micrograms per kilogram.
   Results: Zearalenone levels in all samples was positive and samples levels was less than the limit specified by the Standards and Industrial Research Institute of Iran. The minimum and maximum ZEA mycotoxin, respectively, with a sunflower oil average 2.67 mu g/kg Bw and E brand of corn oil with average was 70.78 mu g/kg Bw. results of ANOVA significant contamination of corn oil, sunflower and blend oil (P 0.001).
   Conclusion: Due to the increased levels of ZEA in corn oil liquid than other oils tested and on the other hand, the consumption of food contaminated with mycotoxins Fungal toxins receive provisional tolerable daily intake is much higher than Expert Committee on Food Additives of the FAO /WHO determined therefore, prevention of mycotoxin contamination ours to control pre-and post-harvest And consideration of relevant experiences and practices is essential to a great extent.

AB Aflatoxin, Fumonisin, Zearalenone and Ochratoxins as mycotoxins afford the carcinogenic, nephrotoxicity, estrogenic problems especially kidney and liver cancer in human and animal. Rice and wheat is important foodstuff that used as feed for world's population. Considering the high rate consumption of rice and its derivatives in human diet, this study was to evaluate the Zearalenone levels in consumed rice samples in Kermanshah city by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. For this aim, 42 samples rice randomly selected from 10 Iranian and 4 imported brands from different parts of city. Results revealed that all samples were contaminated to zearalenone and the zearalenone average in Iranian and imported rice were 4.43 and 3.88 mu g/kg respectively. Given the zearalenone risks for human health, it is recommended the control of zearalenone production during harvesting, preserving, and storage of rice. Therefore, implementing health regulation and monitoring their enforcement, determine the maximum allowable amount of mycotoxins in food and attention of public health andnourishment specialists to this issues is most important.

AB Introduction: Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of women's death in most of the developed and developing countries, which has necessitated women's familiarity with this disease for the sake of early prevention and treatment. The current research was aimed tocompare
   Objective: The Effect of two instruction methods of Short Message Service(SMS) and Pamphlet on women's knowledge, attitude and practice about Breast Cancer. This pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study was carried out on 90 women who visiting the healthcare service of Kamyaran city.
   Methods: The study samples were selected through simple sampling technique and were randomly assigned to three groups, including two cases groups and one control group. The instrument for data collection was a researcher-made questionnaire whose content and face validity was confirmed by the women's healthcare experts and authorities. The reliability of the questionnaire, which was administered to 50 samples, was calculated to be 0.77 by Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The obtained data were analyzed with SPSS-19 software by using T-test and ANOVA.
   Results: The findings indicated that the experimental treatment, increased women's preventive practice about mammographic test. The text messaging group performed significantly better than the control group (P=0.044) and the control group in general Knowledge about breast cancer (p=0.049) and Knowledge about risk factors of breast cancer (P=0.025). But about attitude, text messaging group performed significantly better than the control group (P=0.004). However, no statistical significant difference was reported about other hypothesis. Even the positive effect of text messaging compare with pamphlet and common educational methods.
   Conclusion: It is recommended to be used as a self-care training technique in women for the early diagnosis of breast cancer and follow-up preventive measures

AB Objective: To investigate the correlation between resistance index (RI) of the uterine artery and leiomyoma volume change after uterine artery embolization.
   Methods: 86 consecutive patients who were candidate to undergo uterine artery embolization for management of uterine leiomyoma were included. Before and 6 months after embolization, the volume of leiomyoma and RI of the uterine artery were measured and compared using gray-scale and color Doppler ultrasonography methods.
   Results: Mean (+/- SD) leiomyoma volume decreased from 116.09 (+/- 75.86) cm(3) to 64.76 (+/- 39.52) cm(3) 6 months after embolization (P< 0.001). Mean (+/- SD) RI of the uterine artery increased form 0.67 (+/- 0.074) to 0.76 (+/- 0.099) after embolization (P< 0.001). Mean (+/- SD) change in leiomyoma volume after embolization when compared to values before embolization was 51.32 (+/- 41.78) cm(3). The Pearson correlation coefficient between change in leiomyoma volume and RI of the uterine artery before embolization was -0.23 (P=0.048). Both pre-embolization uterine artery RI and leiomyoma volume had significant value in predicting leiomyoma volume reduction.
   Conclusion: Uterine artery RI can be used before uterine artery embolization to predict treatment response

AB Background: The co-occurrence of pulmonary artery hypertension and heart diastolic dysfunction can increase the chance of death. We aimed to compare the right ventricular (RV) diastolic function in pulmonary artery hypertensive patients and healthy individuals using the echocardiography findings.
   Methods: In this study, 32 individuals with pulmonary artery pressure of >= 40 were selected as a case group and 32 healthy individuals were selected as the control group, and the echocardiography indices of RV diastolic function were compared between the two groups.
   Results: Nineteen individuals in the case group had RV diastolic dysfunction (59.4%), while none were observed in the control group (p<0.001). The mean (+/- SD) of E/E' ratio was significantly higher in the case group compared to the control group, which confirms the RV dysfunction (P=0.002). Although the tricuspid peak A velocity in the case group was significantly higher compared to the control group, its rate was within the normal range in both groups (P=0.01). In addition, the mean (+/- SD) of the E/A ratio and E'/A' ratio were significantly lower in the case group than in the control group, which showed the RV dysfunction (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the other RV diastolic indices between the two groups (p>0.05).
   Conclusions: The presence of pulmonary hypertension can affect the RV diastolic indices, and this is explained in our study by the decreased E/A ratio. Therefore, considering the role of RV diastolic function in the prevention of heart failure and its complications, understanding the current status of these indices is highly important.

AB Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been noted recently as a prognostic factor in patients with cardiovascular diseases. The present study was done to find any relationship between NLR and number of diseased coronary arteries in patients underwent coronary angiography in Imam Ali University Hospital of Kermanshah, Iran between 2012 and 2014. In this retrospective study, medical records of 1,498 patients who underwent coronary angiography were reviewed. The data extracted were entered into a checklist. NLR was calculated using complete blood count (CBC) reports and the number of diseased coronary arteries was determined using coronary angiography reports. The data were analyzed using SPSS software (ver. 20.0) by analysis of variance (ANOVA), t test, Kruskal-Wallis, and Pearson correlation tests. There were significant (P<0.05) relationships between NLR, history of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), fasting blood sugar, serum creatinine and urea, white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin, platelet count, MCV (mean corpuscular volume), and with the number of diseased coronary arteries detected on coronary angiography. However, there was no significant relationship (P>0.05) between history of hyperlipidemia, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, type of cardiac chest pain (acute or chronic), serum total cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein), LDL (low-density lipoprotein), and triglyceride with the number of diseased coronary arteries. NLR was effective on the number of diseased coronary arteries (i.e., the severity of disease). Application of this laboratory factor can be helpful in patients with ischemic heart disease.

AB Background: Improving or deteriorating effects of cardiac revascularization on left ventricular diastolic dysfunction especially concurrent with left ventricular systolic dysfunction is still controversial.
   Objectives: We aimed to compare diastolic functional status after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with the baseline in patients with known coronary artery disease.
   Methods: Sixty consecutive patients with known coronary artery disease according to coronary angiography findings who were candidates for elective CABG were enrolled in a before-after interventional study. Before and also three months after CABG, the parameters of left ventricular diastolic function were measured by Doppler and tissue Doppler echocardiography by the Paired t test with considering p-value of less than 0.05 as significant.
   Results: The mean +/- SD age of the participants was59.6 +/- 8.7 years (range: 46-78 years) and 75% were men. With regard to the changes in echocardiography parameters, significant improvement in mean DT index (from 224 +/- 54 msec to 192 +/- 42 msec, p < 0.001), IVRT (from 104 +/- 22 msec to 85 +/- 13 msec, p < 0.001), E/Ea Ratio (from 11.19 +/- 3.74 to 9.30 +/- 2.67, P< 0.001), and LV ejection fraction (from 47.59 +/- 6.94% to 49.36 +/- 7.77%, P=0.007) was observed. Among all subjects, 56.6% experienced improvement in cardiac diastolic function index with more improvement in men than in women, non-diabetics compared with diabetics, normotensive compared with hypertensive individuals (57.1% versus 36.6%), and nonsmokers than in smokers. Younger patients also experienced more improvement in diastolic function index than the patients older than 60 years, however the improvement of these functional parameters remained independent to the number of involved coronary vessels.
   Conclusions: Improvement of left ventricular diastolic function can be achieved about three months after CABG surgery, independent to the severity of coronary artery diseas

AB Background: Along with left ventricular dysfunction as a powerful prognostic marker in patients with heart failure, right ventricular dysfunction has been shown to be a powerful determinant for early and late mortality and morbidity. There is still uncertain the best echocardiography parameters for predicting clinical outcome in patients with heart failure. The present study assessed the value of right ventricular systolic and diastolic parameters to predict long-term outcome and also health-related quality of life (QOL) in patients with heart failure.
   Methods: One hundred and forty patients diagnosed as congestive heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35% were included into the study. Systolic and diastolic functional status was assessed using tissue Doppler echocardiography and QOL was also assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire. The patients were followed-up by telephone to determine one-year survival and rate of re-hospitalization.
   Results: The tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and right ventricular tissue Doppler imaging systolic velocity (STDI) were positively and E/Ea ratio were adversely associated with higher QOL score. Using the multivariate linear regression model, among baseline variables and echocardiography parameters, the level of QOL could predicted by higher STDI (beta = 0.811, standard error = 0.369, p = 0.030) and lower E/Ea ratio (beta = -0.626, standard error = 0.242, p = 0.011). Also, using the ROC curve analysis, the systolic parameters of TAPSE and STDI, as well as E/Ea diastolic function index could predict patients' QOL level. One-year survival rate was estimated 99.3% and also one-year readmission-free survival rate was also 70.0%. Using the Cox proportional hazard modeling, none of the baseline demographic, clinical, and echocardiography parameters could predict long-term readmission in heart failure patients.
   Conclusion: QOL level in heart failure patients can be predicted by right ventricular systolic parameters of TAPSE and STDI as well as E/Ea diastolic parameter assessed by tissue Doppler imaging. However, both right ventricular systolic and diastolic parameters may not be helpful to predict the rate of readmission in patients with heart failure.

AB Introduction: Stroke is an important health problem that may lead to serious disabilities or even to death. In the present study we aimed to investigate whether complete blood count parameters can aid in the detection and the differential diagnosis of infarct positive Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), infarct-negative TIA, and ischemic stroke (IS) in patient followed up in the emergency department.
   Materials and methods: This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 252 patients meeting the medical history and physical examination criteria for TIA (n=99) and IS (n=153) Neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts, platelet distribution width (PDW), and mean platelet volume (MPV) levels obtained from the complete blood count taken at the time of emergency department admission were recorded for both patient and control groups; platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were calculated from these parameters. The ischemic stroke, TIA, and control groups, as well as other subgroups were compared with one another with respect to the complete blood count parameters.
   Results: Neutrophil count, MPV, and NLR levels were higher in the IS group compared to the control group whereas IS group had a lower lymphocyte count, platelet count, and a PDW level compared to the control group. TIA group had a higher neutrophil count, NLR and PLR than the control group whereas lymphocyte count and PDW level were lower in the TIA group compared to the control group. MPV level was higher in the IS and infarct-positive TIA patient group than both the control group and infarct-negative TIA patient group.
   Conclusion: Owing to high MPV levels in both infarct-positive TIA and IS, we suggest that MPV can be a good marker for infarction. Furthermore, lower platelet count in the IS group and higher PLR in the TIA group can both be used in the differential diagnosis of both conditions.

AB Introduction: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is one of the most common nosocomial pathogens in intensive care units (ICUs), with an increased prevalence of multidrug resistance in nosocomial infections. The treatment options are very limited in infections caused by multi drug resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa strains. Combinations of antimicrobials are frequently used in the treatment of MDR P. aeruginosa infections. In this study we investigated the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem(IMP), doripenem(DOR), colistin(CO) and polymyxin B (PO) alone and in vitro synergistic activity of carbapenem-polymixin combinations (IMP-CO, DOR-CO and DOR-PO) in MDR P. aeruginosa strains obtained from patients in ICUs.
   Materials and methods: Thirty P. aeruginosa strains isolated from various clinical specimens of patients in ICUs were included in the study. The epsilometer test(E test), which is a gradient diffusion method was used for determining synergistic activities of different antibiotic combinations. Synergistic, additive, indifferent and antagonist effects of P. aeruginosa strains were evaluated by fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index.
   Results: Of the 30 MDR P. aeruginosa strains tested, susceptibility rates for IMP, DOR and PO were 40%, 70% and 96.6%, respectively. Resistance to CO was not detected. IMP-CO, DOR-CO and DOR-PO combinations were found to have synergistic or additive effect in 19.9%, 3.3% and 3.3% of the tested strains, respectively.
   Conclusion: Combination therapy is recommended for the treatment of MDR P. aeruginosa infections in order to ensure synergistic action and decrease the risk of development of resistance. In this study, combinations of IMP-CO, DOR-CO and DOR-PO exhibited synergistic activity in some MDR P. aeruginosa strains. Among the tested antimicrobial combinations, IMP-CO combination was the most effective against MDR P. aeruginosa strains. The development of new combination therapy protocols will help clinicians in selecting appropriate agents for the treatments of infections caused by MDR bacteria.

AB Introduction: The emergence of new drugs, their combinations and different treatment schemes, make determining the effectiveness of current treatments in clinical practice necessary and highlights the need for an evaluation of its economic impact on the health system. A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of first line treatment adjusted to the main classification models.
   Materials and methods: The primary end points were: median overall survival (mOS) and median progression-free survival (mPFS) times. The evaluation of cost-effectiveness throughout treatment was assessed by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) based on the cost per year of life gained (YLG).
   Results: The study included 88 patients, grouped according to the drug used for first-line treatment. An increase of 4.9 (p = 0.000) in mPFS and 12.6 months (p = 0.000) for mOS was found among patients treated with sunitinib compared with those treated with temsirolimus. By adjusting the mPFS treatments according to the main classification models, we observe that a statistically significant difference remains between the treatments in both the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and Hudes model. This was not found in the Heng model, in which there is a slight statistically insignificant difference in favor of temsirolimus. No differences were found in the mOS in any case. In the poor prognosis group, which is the prognostic criteria required for the use of temsirolimus, the incremental cost of sunitinib per month free of progression would be of 3,098.2(sic).
   Conclusions: Based on these results it appears that the use of temsirolimus as the most effective option for patients with a poor prognosis, as defined by the criteria in the pivotal trial of temsirolimus or the MSKCC model, may be questionable. However, a larger population would be needed in both groups to determine the relevance of these results.

AB Introduction: Despite the fact that cathepsins (Cat) are known to be associated with the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA), there is no relevant literature regarding (cystatin-C) Cys-C, which is a natural inhibitor of Cat in human OA. The purpose of this study is to investigate the levels of Cys-C and total free thiol (TFT) in the serum and synovial liquid of patients with OA.
   Materials and methods: Forty OA patients, diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, and 40 healthy individuals were included in the study. In serum and fluid samples taken from patients and controls, the serum TFT levels were studied with Elman's method, and the Cys-C levels were studied with colorimetric method using commercially available kits in an autoanalyzer.
   Results: Cys-C levels were significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group (p<0.05), and serum TFT levels were similar between groups (p>0.05). A correlation analysis showed that the levels of serum Cys-C were positively correlated with the presence of OA (correlation coefficient = 0.300, p = 0.014) and negatively correlated with the TFT levels (correlation coefficient = -0.231, p = 0.024). In the regression analysis, it was observed that only the presence of OA independently affected the levels of Cys-C beta regression coefficient = 0.130, p = 0.024).
   Conclusion: In patients with OA, the level of serum Cys-C was determined to be higher than in controls. This may be related with the pathogenesis of disease, increased oxidative stress, or chronic inflammation in OA.

AB Introduction: Severe sepsis and septic shock are associated with high mortality. Antibiotherapy must be started as early as possible since it seems to be the most important factor determining survival. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the time intervals between diagnosis and first dose of antibiotherapy and its impact on mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock patients.
   Materials and methods: Medical records of adult patients (>= 18 years old) admitted to medical ICU of a 1200-bed university hospital in Izmir,Turkey with the diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic shock between January 1,2010 and June 30,2014 were evaluated retrospectively. The patients admitted with other diagnosis than severe sepsis and septic shock and patients having an advanced stage of malignancy were excluded.
   Results: One hundred and ten patients were identified fullfilling the inclusion criteria. 49(44.5%) patients were female and 61(55.5%) were male. Average age of the patients was 74,3 +/- 11,6. Average time from diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock to first dose of antibiotherapy was identified to be 6,9 4,7 hours. Patients were classified into two groups according to application of first dose of antibiotherapy (early<3 hours vs late>3 hours). The overall mortality rate was 54.5%. Mortality rates in early group were significantly lower than late group [25%(n=5) vs 61%(n=55), p<0,05 J. Chronic renal failure was the only comorbidity significantly affecting mortality (p<0,05). Logistic regression analysis displayed early antibiotherapy (p=0,005), culture positivity (p=0,025) and APACHE II scores (p=0,006) to be important in predicting mortality.
   Conclusions: Time to antibiotherapy is an extremely important factor predicting mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock. Any delay in diagnosis and intense treatment including appropriate antibiotherapy should be avoided to decrease mortality rates.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to compare serum copeptin levels in patients with chronic sinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) with those of healthy volunteers.
   Methods: Serum copeptin levels were determined using ELISA in 24 patients with CRSwNP and 20 healthy volunteers without CRSwNP (control group). The study was conducted by the Outpatient Clinic of the Otorhinolaryngology Department of Antalya Training and Research Hospital and included subjects aged over 18 years who were visited for nasal and postnasal discharge, nasal stuffiness, facial pain ongoing for at least 12 weeks and CRS with or without nasal polyps.
   Results: A total of 44 subjects, 28 males (63.6%) and 16 females (36.4%) with a mean age of 38.7 +/- 13.8 years (range, 20 69 years) were included in the study and divided in a treatment group (24 patients with nasal polyposis) and a control group (20 healthy subjects). No statistically significant different ewas evidenced between the groups in terms of copeptin levels.
   Conclusions: Increased serum copeptin concentration may reflect a response to stress in various diseases. No difference was determined between the CRSwNP patients and the healthy volunteers in terms of copeptin levels.

AB Introduction: Cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) is a major cause of death in developed countries. While 80% of the arrests occur due to cardiac pathologies, 20% occur due to non-cardiac pathologies. Determining the underlying pathology is very important. In this retrospective study, we examined the potential utilities of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in cardiac and non-cardiac arrest distinction.
   Materials and methods: We enrolled the following participants: 136 patients with cardiac arrests and 152 patients with noncardiac arrests between January 2012 and December 2015. The distinction was made primarily on whether cardiac pathology was present. The cardiac pathology was determined by using cardiac enzyme levels, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings, angiographic results, and patient history.
   Results: Cardiac arrests were observed more frequently in male patients, while the number of non-cardiac arrests was greater in female patients (p= 0.018). PLR and NLR were higher in non-cardiac arrests than in cardiac arrests (p< 0.001 for PLR and p= 0.001 for NLR). None of these parameters showed any effect on the 30-day mortality. The sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV) of the PLRs and NLRs were 80.1%, 42.2%, 64.0%, and 62.3% and 49.7%, 73.5%, 68.8%, and 55.4%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for the PLR was 61.7%, and the AUC for the NLR was 61.0%.
   Conclusion: We suggest that the NLR and PLR can be helpful in the differential diagnosis of cardiac and non-cardiac arrest. Thus, the NLR and PLR should be evaluated in addition to the clinical examination.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Adducin Gly460Trp, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C gene polymorphisms that are supposed to play a role in atherothrombotic process in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
   Materials and methods: This prospective study was performed on a total of 270 participants between January 2013 and June 2014. The participants were divided into two groups: Group 1 (PAD group) included 180 patients with PAD (mean age: 55 +/- 18 years, 128 males), and Group 2 (control group) included 90 participants (mean age: 53 +/- 15 years, 61 males) with normal physical examination and arterial duplex ultrasonography findings for PAD. Groups were compared with each other according to the clinical and demographic characteristics, levels of some biochemical parameters, allele frequencies, and particularly Adducin Gly460Trp, MTHFR C677T and A1298C gene polymorphisms, which were determined by using real time polymerase chain reaction.
   Results: The incidences of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, family history of cardiovascular diseases and fasting glucose levels were significantly higher in PAD group. Both groups were statistically similar according to the levels of total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, urea and creatinine. Comparison of both groups according to the Adducin Gly460Trp, MTHFR C677T and A1298C gene polymorphisms, and allele frequencies did not yield any statistically significant differences.
   Conclusion: We concluded that Adducin Gly460Trp, MTHFR C677T and A1298C gene polymorphisms were not predictive factors for PAD. The investigations on different polymorphisms of Adducin and MTHFR may be beneficial.

AB Introduction: Celiac disease affects 0.6 to 1.0% of the population worldwide. Undiagnosed CD has been significantly linked with a nearly 4-fold increase in all-cause mortality. The present study was designed to investigate the prevalence of undiagnosed Celiac Disease (CD) and to study the characteristics of these patients in the adult population in Mersin, Turkey.
   Materials and methods: This study was undertaken through the time frame of June 2011- January 2013. Adults aged 18 and older living in Mersin are included in the study. Family physicians and volunteers registered to these family physicians were selected district-wide through random sampling method, stratified sampling method, respectively. Participants were tested for anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) and anti-Deaminated Gliadin Peptide(DGP) IgA and IgG Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA). Small intestinal biopsies were obtained from the seropositive patients, and they were examined according to the Marsh classification.
   Results: 1.554 people participated in the study. Mean age was 42 years and 50,4% were female. 12 (0.77%) of the participants showed anti-tTG/DGP IgA or IgG positivity. The mean age of seropositive participants was 41 years and 83% of them were female. All seropositive participants were either human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or DQ8 positive.
   Conclusion: This study is the first population-based prevalence study of CD in Turkish adult population. We found that seroprevalence of CD as 0.77% and biopsy proven CD prevalence as 0.39%. Patients with iron deficiency anemia or with relatives diagnosed as CD must be evaluated closely.

AB Background: that low-grade chronic inflammation is a key principle in pathogenesis in most of the Chronic Non-communicable Diseases. The aim of the present study is to analyze the effects of the endurance and resistance training on IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-10 in sedentary young women.
   Materials and methods: Thirty female volunteer students who were overweight were chosen (BMI >= 25), and they were randomly distributed into three groups of resistance training, endurance training and control. The training groups practiced for twelve weeks and three times a week with a definite intensity and distance. IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-10, weight, fat percentage, BMI and the maximum oxygen consumption were measured before and after the twelve weeks of exercise.
   Results: The results showed that the endurance and resistance trainings, except for BMI have a significant effect upon the body fat percentage, VO2max, IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-10. In addition, there was not a significant difference between the effect of the resistance and endurance trainings upon the above mentioned variables.
   Conclusion: It seems that the endurance and resistance trainings with the significant decrease of the inflammation cytokines will decrease the chronic Non-communicable diseases in sedentary young women.

AB Introduction: Heart failure is a chronic debilitating disease that is often associated with complexities in treatment and care. Therefore, patients need the support of their families to adapt to their new condition. This study explored the role of family support for patients with heart failure.
   Methods and results: This qualitative study was performed in hospitals affiliated with the Kerman University of Medical Sciences in southeastern Iran. Eighteen patients with heart failure were selected through purposive sampling. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed by qualitative content analysis. The experiences of participants were presented in the four classifications of "Family as an emotional support", "Family as a source of information", "Family physical care", and "Family as a financial support".
   Conclusion: According to the findings, family caregivers play an important role in patients' well-being and compliance with their new state by providing various aspects of care. It is essential that healthcare providers determine the education requirements of family caregivers so as to implement training programs aimed at enhancing their knowledge and skills.

AB Objective: There are a lot of physical and inner changes during pregnancy period. These can start with slight psychological disorders and then leads to severe psychological disorders or even psychosis. The present study was aimed at evaluating the effect of stress reduction program based on mindfulness and conscious yoga on depression, perceived stress and lifestyle of pregnant women.
   Methodology: In this study, a randomized controlled clinical trial with measurements in pre-test, post-test, and control group was used and 30 pregnant women diagnosed with depression and stress were selected by convenience among the patients who were taken to the maternity ward of Shariati hospital in Tehran. Consequently, they were randomly put into two groups including test group (n= 15; under the treatment of mindfulness-based stress reduction program and conscious yoga in eight weekly group session) and control group (n= 15). Hamilton depression scale perceived stress scale and quality of life questionnaire were completed by the participants in all three phases.
   Results: Based on the analysis of variance with repeated measures, this intervention was effective in quality of life and psychological components. The signs of depression and perceived stress decreased compared to baseline and it lasted for two months of follow-up.
   Conclusion: The results of this research suggests that mindfulness-based stress reduction program and conscious yoga can be considered as a suitable remedy for improving the quality of life and decreasing stress in pregnant women. Thus, implementation of mindfulness-based stress reduction program and conscious yoga is suggested.

AB Objectives: The goal of the current study was to gather the opinions of medical education experts in order to determine the necessary preparations for implementation of a successful faculty development program for teaching and learning medical professionalism to do professional.
   Design: The study was triangulated and it was done in two phases. The first phase was qualitative. Data gathering was done by semi structured interview. Interviews were transcript and analyzed by classic content analysis. And then in second phase by focus group of six experts, experts changed and added some themes. At the end, the themes were confirmed by Delphi.
   Participants and setting: Participants were 23 experts in medical education from high ranked medical universities in Iran.
   Main results: After analyzing the content of the interviews, confirming and editing themes in focus group and Delphi, we had two main themes and 18 subthemes. Main themes were 1) Organization preparations included four sub-themes of professional behavior requirements, needs assessment, initial evaluation and removing the barriers; 2) Preparing the audience with three sub-themes of motivating the faculty members, creating understanding regarding professionalism and engaging the faculty members in development program.
   Conclusions: Before starting the faculty development programs for medical professionalism, we should notice many organizational and personal items. These items are important to lead a successful program.

AB Introduction: Staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the opportunistic pathogens that creates dangerous hospital infections. High resistance against Beta-lactamase in staphylococcus strains has led to concerns in medical system. Therefore, a rapid and effective method should be used to diagnose resistance. This study aimed to determine the antibiotic resistance pattern, the abundance of mecAgene, and the class and types of SCCmec in staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from the clinical samples of Isfahan.
   Materials an methods: In a cross-sectional study, 252 clinical samples with the age range from infancy to 90 years old were selected from Asgarieh hospital and Nobel laboratory. After determining the identification of isolations, the antibiotic sensitivity to disk diffusion method was evaluated. Resistance to methicillin was evaluated based on agar screening method. Also, MIC values were examined using Etest method. The identification of mecA and determination of SCCmec types were done by MultiplexPCR method.
   Results: Among 120 isolations of staphylococcus epidermidis, according to agar screening test and Etest, 68 isolations were resistant to methicillin. The prevalence of resistance to methicillin was observed in 37 samples (54/41%). The typing of SCCmec types were different: 17 (45/94%) isolations were Type V, 5 (13/51%) isolations were Type II, 3 (8/1%) isolations were type III, 2 (5/4%) isolations were Type IV, 2 (5/4%) isolations were Type I, 1 (2/7%) isolation was Type IV, and 12 (32/43%) isolations were non-typable.
   Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the most abundant type of SCCmec wasType V (67/5%) that transfers many resistance genes.

AB Objective: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) may account for approximately half of the burden of childhood anemia worldwide. This study was conducted to assess serum level of soluble Transferin Receptor (sTfR) in children with IDA and healthy subjects recruited to Children's Medical Center.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 26 children with IDA and 27 apparently healthy were recruited from Children's Medical Center, Tehran, Iran, from 2008 to 2009. Hb, MCV were measured using a SYSMEX K21 cell counter. The serum ferritin(SF) was measured using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on an automated Elecsys2010 (Roche Diagnostics) and serum sTfR levels were measured by ELISA method.
   Results: In Children with IDA had higher level of sTfR, compared with control group. We found a significant negative correlation of sTfR with Hb, MCV and ferritin although it was not significant for SF. STfR found to be unrelated to age and gender in both groups.
   Conclusion: When a ferritin level is not reliable in circumstances such as infection and inflammation, sTfR can be considered as a useful test for evaluating iron deficiency.

AB Introduction: post cesarean anxiety is followed by reducing resistance against infections, accordingly, anxiety management is one of high significant factors for the health of mothers and newborns. The aim of this study is evaluation of the aromatic effects of Citrus aurantium and Salvia officinal son post cesarean anxiety.
   Methods: This clinical trial was conducted on 120 women, referring to the Motazedi hospital of Kermanshah for cesarean in 2015. The subjects were randomly divided into two intervention groups and one control group. In the intervention groups, aromatherapy was performed with three drops of essence immediately after the onset of pain and after 12 hours. Anxiety was assessed using STAI. For data analysis, ANOVA, Tucky, Chi-square, and were performed.
   Findings: before intervention, there was no significant difference on mean of anxiety in three groups. After intervention these two aromas had the same effect on reducing post cesarean anxiety.
   Conclusion: It is recommended to use both aromas as a simple, on-invasive and economical technique to reduce post cesarean anxiety.

AB Introduction: In squamous cell lung cancer (SQCLC), the current first-line therapy is considered platinum-based doublet chemotherapy and the benefit is limited. Aim of our study is to compare the effect of patients with local advanced or metastatic SQCLC, in comparable groups of patients treated with systemic chemotherapy containing gemcitabine/cisplatin (GP) or GP+ Endostar.
   Materials and methods: All patients with local advanced or metastatic SQCLC who had undergone GP+ continuous administration of Endostar from September 2009 to January 2014 were evaluated. The GP group was constituted by selecting patients with local advanced or metastatic SQCLC treated with GP chemotherapy during the same period.
   Results: Fifty-two patients were retrospectively included in the GP group and were compared with 98 patients who had undergone continuous administration of Endostar +GP and were evaluated prospectively. All characteristics were comparable. Median follow-up was 60 months in the GP group versus 58 months in the Endostar +GP group. The response rate (RR) was 34.7% in Endostar +GP group and 34.6% in the GP group. The disease control rate (DCR) was 89.7% in Endostar +GP group and 80.8% in the GP group. Both the RR and DCR were not found to be significantly different with each other. Median progression free survival (PFS) was 5.56 months in the GP group versus 7.23 months in the Endostar +GP group.
   Discussion: The combination of continuous infusion of Endostar with chemotherapy can improve the PFS in local advanced or metastatic SQCLC patients without increasing adverse events.

AB Background and purpose: Tobit model is one of regression models that is used for estimating the relationship between an explanatory variable and truncated or censored dependent variable. This study want to survey the potential of Tobit regression as a tool to study risk factors of time to onset of CMV in kidney transplant recipients.
   Materials and methods: 242 kidney transplant recipients from 2010 to 2015 in Shahid Beheshti hospital, Babol, Iran entered to the retrospective cohort study. All patients' clinical and demographic characteristics were analyzed as risk factors. The response variable was the time to onset of CMV infection and Tobit model was used to evaluate the factors affecting it.
   Results: Evaluating the time to incidence of CMV infection in recipients of renal transplants with Tobit regression, revealed that age at the time of transplantation (p=0.01), hypertension (p=0.05), etiology of urologic disease (p=0.02) have a significant relationship with the period of time to onset of CMV infection after renal transplantation.
   Conclusion: As a results in this study, the time to onset of CMV is influenced by the age of patients. So, the more the age is, the less period of time is to onset of CMV infection. This time will be shorter with hypertension and etiology of urologic diseases for ESRD in these patients.

AB Objective: Multiple myeloma (MM) accounts for approximately 1% of all cancers and 10% of hematologic malignancies. Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a common side effect of cancer therapy that can have an impact on quality of life and survivorship. PN may happen in MM due to adverse effect of chemotherapeutics, amyloidosis or as a part of paraneoplastic syndrome. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in multiple myeloma patients and its association with age and disease outcome.
   Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 92 multiple myeloma patients who presented to hematology clinic between 2009 and 2014. Their age, gender, performance status, chemotherapeutic regimens, stage of disease, diabetes status and electromyography results were noted. An association between clinical parameters and neuropathy was analyzed. Kaplan Meier analysis was used in statistical comparisons between mortality and other parameters.
   Results: The mean age of patients was 64 +/- 11.6. Patients with neuropathy were enrolled as group 1 (27.2%) and patients without neuropathy were enrolled as group 2 (72.8%). No significant association was found between age and peripheral neuropathy (p=1.00). The estimated median survival time was 27 months in patients with PN, whereas 56 months in patients without PN (p=0.273). In group 1 three year overall survival rate was 41% whereas in group 2 it was 57%.
   Conclusion: It is important to understand pathophysiology of PN and recognize who is at risk since; it is a common side effect of MM treatment. This study is among the few analyses evaluating prevalence of peripheral neuropathy confirmed with electromyography in MM patients. There was no significant association between increased age, survival and neuropathy. Evaluating other associations and understanding potential risks with further research may guide us in developing better preventive and treatment modalities for PN in older MM patients.

AB Introduction: Primary lymphoma of the bone (PLB) is a rare clinicopathological disease. PLB accounts for approximately 3% of all malignant tumors. It frequently affects the femur and pelvis, and the spine is affected only in 1.7% of all cases. Because it is a rare disease, the optimal treatment strategy has not yet been established.
   Case presentation: We present a case of a 36-year-old male who had complaints of back pain, leg pain and fatigue that did not affect his daily tasks. The positron emission tomography (PET) also showed multifocal lesions of bones. An excisional biopsy of osteolytic lesions in the left scapula revealed diffuse large B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. Chemotherapy was administered and complete response was observed.
   Conclusion: Multifocal PLB is an exceptional situation. The diagnosis is challenging because of the low incidence and unspecific radiological features. Studies should be carried out to identify the optimal treatment in the future. Here, we want to emphasize the complete response with chemotherapy of a multicentric involvement primal), bone lymphoma.

ID PULMONARY INVOLVEMENT; FLUID; EFFUSION
AB Introduction: Serum procalcitonin (PCT) is associated with the severity and prognosis in pulmonary tuberculosis. However, previous studies on its clinical association in pleural tuberculosis are lacking. The aim of study is to investigate the association between serum PCT and clinical parameters and define its utility, in patients with pleural tuberculosis.
   Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 71 immuocompetence patients (median age, 44 years; PCT < 0.05 ng/mL, n = 40 vs. PCT >= 0.05 ng/mL, n = 31), with pleural tuberculosis
   Results: There were 44 males. The median serum PCT level was 0.025ng/mL (interquartile range (IQR): 0.025 - 0.110). Forty patients (56%) had pulmonary tuberculosis by radiologic or microbiological criteria. One patient died, and two patients had drug resistance. At the end of treatment, the incidence of residual pleural opacity (RPO) was 62% on chest radiography (CXR). Male, pleuro-pulmonary tuberculosis, high pleural lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), RPO on CXR and mycobacterial identification in pleural fluid were associated with abnormal serum PCT level, in univariable logistic analysis. However, only pleuro-pulmonary tuberculosis (OR: 5.099, 95% CI, 1.044 - 24.908, P = 0.044) and high pleural LDH (OR: 12.874, 95% CI, 2.885 - 57.453, P = 0.001) were still significantly related to serum PCT above normal value, by multivariable logistic analysis.
   Conclusions: Serum PCT level can be associated with concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis and the degree of pleural inflammation in pleural tuberculosis. Therefore, serum PCT can aid physicians in selecting patients that require early isolation and greater attention.

AB Introduction: Analysis of the dynamic mechanism of lumbar vertebrae and pelvis in human falls is of great importance both academically and in practice.
   Materials and methods: Using CT scanning of the human body, the finite element model of the lumbar vertebrae and pelvis was reconstructed by Amira and ICEM software: Dynamic simulations for different landing postures and falling height were conducted by coupling the ANSYS and LS-DYNA software
   Results: The dynamic simulation was able to reproduce the landing process of the human,body and the injured sites.
   Discussion: Results indicate that different landing postures will cause different injury sites, sloping posture will result in serious injury and bone fracture is usually caused by shear force.

AB Introduction: Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging is a widely accepted interventional imaging modality in clinical diagnosis and treatment of vascular diseases, especially coronary artery diseases. Accurate identification and classification of atherosclerotic plaques are essential for predict the possible evolution of plaques.
   Materials and methods: Automated tissue characterization including atherosclerotic plaques, vessel branching and stent struts in IVUS gray-scale images is addressed. The texture features are firstly detected with local binary pattern (LBP), Haar-like and Gabor filter. Then, a Gentle Adaboost classifier is designed to classify tissue texture features. The manual characterization results obtained by experienced physicians were adopted as the golden standard to evaluate the accuracy.
   Results: Results with clinically acquired image data indicate that the recognition accuracy of lipidic plaques can reach 94.54%, while classification precision of fibrous and calcified plaques can reach 93.08%. The recognition accuracy of branching and stents can reach 93.20% and 93.50%, respectively.
   Conclusion: Fully automated identification of soft/hard plaques, vessel branching and stent struts can be realized through detecting and classifying the texture features of IVUS images. However, accurate classification of lipidic, fibrous, calcified and mixed plaques may be implemented according to grey-scale images combined with raw radio-frequency signals.

AB Introduction: An organization has obligations toward its internal and external elements, but its inherent authority does not generally allow vindication of rights by their rightful owners. Hospitals have become more ethical by approaching conditions where people can properly vindicate their rights; that is, they are more predictable. This study aimed to explain ethical predictability of healthcare centers in Iran.
   Methodology: This qualitative study was conducted on 25 people selected by purposive sampling. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews, which were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed several times, and examined by three experts. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis.
   Results: A total of 706 concepts were extracted, and categorized in three main themes of "essential infrastructures", "barriers to ethical predictability", and "accountable organization"
   Conclusion: The results showed that ethical predictability depends on certain underlying factors, including concurrent respect for the rights of clients and employees, motivational management, and institutionalization of ethics. Hence, managers can enhance predictability by considering ethical indicators as criteria for decision-making and policy-making. This will in turn lead to respect for the rights of patients and employees. Ethical acculturation through mass media, religious institutions, and educational organizations such as schools and universities can help its institutionalization

AB Introduction: Cardiovascular disease is the leading contributor of global death. Because of steadily expanding ascend in death rate, the earnest need is to discover novel prognostic biomarkers. In this attempt, inflammation has been a prominent target because of its importance in the development and behavior of atherosclerotic plaques. The current article came up from the recent suggestions by the scientific community on the role of neutrophils to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as an inflammatory predictive biomarker of cardiovascular events at an early stage.
   Materials and methods: Blood samples were collected from 100 chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) patients who have visited the outpatient department (OPD) at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and 100 healthy control individuals. Complete blood examination was done on Cell-Dyn Ruby, USA to calculate NLR. In addition, lipid profile, platelet counts, red cell distribution width (RDW), C-reactive proteins (CRP), fasting glucose, insulin and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were also measured by various procedures on different instruments.
   Results: Total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) showed a significant rise of around 13%. However, non-highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (Non-HDL) level showed a similar decline (P< 0.05) compared with control. A remarkable rise in fasting glucose, Hb1Ac, and insulin by 58%, 53%, and 44% was recorded in CAD group. Moreover, CRP level also showed a significant rise of 39% in CAD group compared with control individuals. The white blood cell (WBC) analysis revealed a significant enhancement in total WBC, neutrophils and lymphocytes counts. The calculated NLR was found to be significantly (P< 0.001) elevated by 110% in CAD patients compared with control individuals.
   Conclusions: In view of significant enhancement of NLR level in our samples, we recommend its use as a predictive biomarker of CAD because it is a simple and inexpensive method and could be performed in a routine blood sample.

AB Introduction: Medication errors are the most common medical errors which are used today as an indicator to determine the level of patient safety in hospitals. According to several papers and diversity of reports on the prevalence of medication errors, the aim of this study was determination of the frequency of medication errors in Iranian hospitals using meta-analysis.
   Methods: Articles were selected using the keywords including medication error, prescribing error, dispensing error, administration error, transcribing error and their Persian equivalents by searching in national and international databases. Then, documents were selected and entered into the study using criteria of systematic reviews and Meta-analysis. Due to the heterogeneity of primary studies, data was estimated using a random effects model.
   Results: At the end of the search process, 33 articles were included in the study. The overall incidence of medication errors in Iranian hospitals (23.9 to 39.7) was estimated as 31.8%, prescribing error was obtained as (30.2 to 59.4) 44.8%, administration error (27.02-50.6), transcription error (3.3 to 14.9), and error preparation (9.5-23.4) have also been estimated as 38.8%, 9.1%, and 16.4%. The incidence of medication errors in Iranian hospitals was estimated 41.8% (19.8 to 63.9) based on self-reports. The dispensing error has been reported in three studies which was variable from 1.4 to 11.3%.
   Conclusions: This study shows that frequency of medication errors is generally high in the drug serving processes.

AB Background and objective: Development of web-based primary health care information system capable of collecting, processing, storing, reporting, and the system evaluation is one of the methods used to increase the efficiency that can improve the quality of health care and services. The purpose of this research is to design and evaluate web-based information system of primary health care for health centers.
   Method: The present research is an applied descriptive study. The population consists of all units at different levels of rural and urban health centers. The forms obtained from these centers were used as a sample to design the information system by SQL database and the graphical interface ASP. NET. The terminology codes of Iranian health database were used to exchange information. A checklist was used to analyze the users' attitudes toward the effect of the system on health promotion.
   Results: The general attitude of users in all health centers toward the impact of the System on promoting health was evaluated positively with an average of 68%. Also the effect of information system on reducing the registration errors, increasing the speed and accuracy of information, information exchange, avoiding duplication, reducing the costs and facilitating reports was evaluated with a mean score of 64%.
   Conclusion: The users' positive opinion suggests that a suitable context to implement web-based system is provided in health care centers. Integrity and avoiding duplication of data as well as the ability to communicate with other health information systems can be the basis for national electronic health records in the country.

AB The aim of the study was to effect of a Six-week high-intensity interval training on antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation in inactive men. The sample consisted of inactive men with an average age of 20.80 +/- 1.95 years. Subjects were selected using purposive sampling and were randomly divided into HIIT (N= 9) and control (N= 10) groups. The training program included four sets of the RAST protocol (35 meter distance) with three-minute rests between sets in the first and second week. One set was added each two weeks, i. e. five sets in the third and fourth week and six sets in the fifth and sixth week, with five-minute rests between sets. The results of the study had shown that there is no significant difference between malondialdehyde levels in the pretest and posttest in the experimental group (P= 0.115). Moreover, no significant difference was observed in the control group (P= 0.324). The data also show that there is a significant difference between pretest and posttest TAC levels in the experimental group (P= 0.023), while no significant difference is observed in the control group (P= 0.386). it is recommended that this study be replicated on athletes playing different sport. Also the HIIT protocol can be used for a longer period and/ or different antioxidant enzymes can be measured.

ID UNITS
AB Objective: To study the economic impact of nosocomial infection in hemodialysis patients.
   Methods: We studied 890 hemodialysis patients in our hospital from January 2012 to December 2014 and compared the infection-related factors and economic costs of the infected and infection-free groups.
   Results: Nosocomial infection occurred in 110 cases (12.4%). Univariate analysis showed statistically significant differences in age, length of hospital stay, duration of dialysis, hemoglobin; white blood cell count, catheter site, catheter days, and the number of comorbidities between the infected and uninfected groups (x2 = 8.967 similar to 133.065, P <0.05). Multivariate regression analysis showed young and old age, multiple diseases, long duration of dialysis, two or more catheters, low hemoglobin, low white blood cell count, and long duration of catheterization were risk factors for nosocomial infection (beta = -1.261 similar to 1.212, OR = 0.299 similar to 2322, 95% CI = 0.128 similar to 3.287, Wald = 0.651 similar to 21.504, P < 0.05). The in-hospital costs, medical fees, diagnostic fees, treatment fees, nursing care fees, drug costs, and other expenses were significantly higher in the infection group than uninfected group (t = 49.766 similar to 1039.658, P <0.01).
   Conclusion: Risk factors for nosocomial infections are identifiable and some are readily targetable for intervention or amelioration. Reduction in nosocomial infections could provide substantial economic benefit as well as direct health benefits for the individual patients.

AB Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a highly prevalent disease characterised by obstruction of the airway resulting in reduced oxygen saturation. Hypoxia and blood re-oxygenation episodes called "intermittent hypoxia" (IH) initiates the inflammatory response. Midkine (MK), is a heparin-binding protein and plays a key role in angiogenesis and inflammation. Expression of MK increases under hypoxic conditions. Thus, we hypothesised that serum MK levels would in increase in patients with OSA.
   Materials and methods: Patients who underwent full polysomnography with suspicion of OSA were eligible for the study. Serum MK and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were compared between OSA and control groups.
   Results: Twenty-four control and 53 patients with OSA were enrolled in the study. Median serum MK level was significantly lower in the OSA group than that in the control group (85.93 vs. 131.86 pg/mL, respectively; p = 0.001). No significant correlation was detected between OSA severity and serum MK level. Median serum CRP level tended to be higher in the OSA than that in the control group (2.8 vs. 2.05 mg/L, respectively; p = 0.075), but the difference was significant only in patients with severe OSA compared with those in the control group (43 vs. 2.05 mg/L, respectively; p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Unexpectedly lower serum MK levels were found in patients with OSA than those in the control group, but the mechanism underlying this condition is unclear. Rapid endocytosis, internalisation of serum MK or a different inflammatory response to IH may be responsible for these results.

AB Introduction: Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) pH has been shown to be a good indicator of inflammation in the airways in several pulmonary diseases. Bronchial inflammation is an expected condition also in pulmonary tuberculosis and may play role in the extent of parenchymal infiltration. It is conceivable that EBC pH may be an useful marker in demonstrating the extent of airway inflammation in tuberculosis patients; however, there is limited clinical data about its role in pulmonary tuberculosis. In this prospective study we aimed to investigate the inflammation of the airways by EBC pH and to evaluate the relationship between the degree of smear positivity and the radiological extent of tuberculosis.
   Materials and methods: 19 untreated smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis cases and 31 healthy controls were included in the study. While the control group was investigated for only EBC pH, the patient group was investigated for EBC pH, chest X-ray, serum procalcitonin level and acido-alcohol resistant bacilli examination in sputum smear. Available parameters were compared statistically between healthy controls and patients.
   Results: Mean EBC pH was found to be significantly low in tuberculosis group (p <0.001). In the patient group, there was a moderate negative correlation between EBC pH and ARB positivity (p <0.02), moderate positive correlation between serum procalcitonin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p <0.02), moderate positive correlation between serum procalcitonin and radiological extent (p <0.008), a strong positive correlation between erythrocyte sedimentation rate and radiological extent (p <0.003). However, any statistically significant correlation was not observed between EBC pH and radiological extent.
   Conclusion: In this study it has been demonstrated that EBC pH was in association with pulmonary inflammation in tuberculosis and smear positivity but had no relationship with parenchymal infiltration. On account of this, we state that EBC pH may be useful in the assessment of the airway inflammation and bacillary load, but is not a good predictor of radiological extent of pulmonary tuberculosis.

AB Introduction: Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) is a gram-negative coccobacillus causing life-threatening nosocomial infections in critically ill patients. Although mortality risk factors have been investigated in previous studies, there is not sufficient data about the prognostic roles of tracheostomy and central venous catheterization (CVC) in patients with AB bacteremia. Therefore, we performed this study to assess the risk factors associated to mortality from AB bacteremia in intensive care unit (ICU) with a new perspective.
   Materials and methods: Data of 90 adult patients with AB bacteremia hospitalized between 01 January 2010 and 01 December 2014 in ICU were evaluated retrospectively. The results were assessed in terms of 14th and 28th day mortality rates.
   Results: The 14th day and 28th day mortality rates for patients with AB bacteremia were 31.1 % and 48.9 %, respectively. The 14th day non-survivors were more likely to have chronic kidney disease, insertion of subclavian and femoral CVC compared to survivors. While tracheostomy, jugular CVC, absence of CVC, higher serum albumin and lower procalcitonin (PCT) levels were observed significantly more common in survivors; higher high-sensitivity CRP, higher PCT, and lower albumin levels were significantly more common in mortality group. Risk factors associated with 14th day mortality were high serum PCT (p<0.001), lack of tracheostomy (p=0.004) and CVC location (p=0.007). Whereas, 28th day mortality was associated with chronic kidney disease, malignancy, insertion of subclavian and femoral CVC. High serum PCT (p<0.001), lack of tracheostomy (p=0.001) and CVC location (p=0.006) were determined as independent predictors for 28th day mortality.
   Conclusion: These data reveal that lack of tracheostomy and presence of subclavian or femoral CVC are independent risk factors for 14th and 28th day mortality, and high PCT level is a good predictor for poor prognosis in ICU patients with AB bacteremia. According to our knowledge, this study contributes to current literature in terms of being the first study focused on the prognostic roles of tracheostomy and CVC in patients with AB bacteremia.

AB Background: Today, the importance of food safety cannot be ignored in every community. Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd) and Arsenic (As) are mentioned among the samples of the most dangerous heavy metals and exceeding from concentration of maximum allowable concentrations (MAC) can have serious side effects as well as carcinogenic properties.
   Method: 210 samples of seven brands of internal and imported high consumption packed rice in Iran were selected each brand whereof consisted of 30 samples which were evaluated in terms of contamination with Pb, Cd and As. The evaluation was performed through graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and atomic fluorescence spectrometry methods; afterwards, their concentrations were compared to MAC. Finally, their safety was calculated for the human health.
   Results and conclusion: The average concentrations of Pb, Cd and As in high consumption rice cultivated in or imported to Iran were 0.061, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/kg respectively. The results of this study showed that the weekly intake of these heavy metals in all rice brands was below provisional tolerable weekly intake. These findings suggest that all evaluated high consumption brands are below 1 in terms of health risk index and are safe for the human health in the present study.

AB Objective: Treating rheumatism by leg bath in decoction, as a green therapy, is very popular among Chinese patients suffering from Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), however, relevant experiments and evidence are still wanting. Based on visualization technique, this study demonstrates changes, after leg bath in decoction, at knee joint synovium of rats with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and the efficacy of this therapy is further discussed.
   Methods: Ninety male Wistar rats were randomly and equally assigned to six groups: Health Group, Model Group, Prednisone Acetate Gavage, Rheumatism Decoction Gavage, Hot Water Bath, and Rheumatism Decoction Bath. After 14 days of experiment, MRI data of knee synovium thickness and smoothness of all groups were collected, analyzed and cross compared.
   Results: Due to death or other reasons, data of 43 rats were finally obtained: 11 in Health Group, 7 in Model Group, 5 in Group of Hot Water Bath, 5 in Group of Prednisone Acetate Gavage, 5 in Group of Rheumatism Decoction Gavage, and 10 in Group of Rheumatism Decoction Bath. Comparison was made among MRI results of knee synovium from different groups in aspects of volume rendering, density, horizontal and vertical measurement, boundary curve, and smoothness of the boundary. The result showed that there was huge difference between Health Group and that of Model Group; all data of Group of Rheumatism Decoction Bath were better than any other groups and were the closet to those of Health Group.
   Conclusion: Based on application of visualization techniques, the results can be directly perceived by means of MRI, which showed leg bath in decoction can significantly improve the thickness and smoothness of knee synovium in rats with rheumatism, and its effects are superior to gavage of prednisone acetate or rheumatism decoction, with the placebo effect ruled out (since the result of this group is better than that of Hot Water Bath).

AB Introduction: To determine an effective and non-invasive medical method for evaluating the severity level of extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis by comparing the detection performances of contrast-enhanced ultrasound(CEUS) and digital subtraction angiography(DSA).
   Materials and methods: Thirty-two consecutive patients (7 women and 25 men; mean age: 65.0 +/- 9.4 years, range: 43-78 years) with internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis were examined by CEUS and DSA. The studies were performed using a Hitachi Preirus ultrasound machine for CEUS and Allura Xper FD20 system (Philips Medical Systems, Nederland B.V.) for DSA. The contrast-enhancing agent used was 1.2 ml SonoVize (Bracco, Switzerland),In addition, the performances of CEUS and DSA in assessing the patency of ICA and suitability of CEA (carotid endarterectomy) were explored.
   Results: There was no significant difference between the distributions detected by CEUS and DSA for the four groups. The diameter stenosis percentage measured by CEUS strongly correlated with the DSA image measurements. CEUS reliably identified patients with good sensitivity and specificity at the three cut-off values of 100%, 70%, and 50%. CEUS performed better than DSA in assessing the patency of ICA and suitability of CEA.
   Conclusion: CEUS is an accurate non-invasive imaging test for carotid artery stenosis that is feasible tolerated in patients with different degrees of carotid stenosis.

DE Carotid artery plaque; Real Time Elastography (RTE)
ID NONINVASIVE VASCULAR ELASTOGRAPHY; ATHEROSCLEROSIS
AB Introduction: The aim of the study is to evaluate the ability of Real Time Elastography (RTE) to assess the stiffness of carotid plaque in patients.
   Materials and methods: 96 patients with carotid plaque were enrolled in this study. hypo-echo plaques, complex-echo plaques and strong-echo plaques in 96 patients were found by gray scale ultrasound. Meanwhile, RTE was used to display a color-coded strain map and calculate the strain ratio of different types of echo plaques with surrounding tissue.
   Results: Color-coded RTE image showed that the hypo-echo plaques were mainly red or green, complex-echo plaques were blue and green, and the strong-echo plaques were blue and white. The mean strain ratio of hypo-echo plaques, compounded-echo plaques and strong-echo plaques were 1.21+/-0.69, 435+/-3.19 and 41.14+/-33.09, respectively. There was statistic difference (P<0.05).
   Conclusion: The strain ratio of hypo-echo plaques, complex-echo plaques, strong-echo plaques increased in turn. RTE combined conventional ultrasound to provide more information in the diagnosis of carotid artery plaque stability.

AB Background and aim: Acyclovir (ACV) is a common drug used for treatment of Herpes virus infection. In this study, the role of this drug on apoptosis in rat spermatozoa was investigated along with the effectiveness of two herbal antioxidants of vitamin C (VC) and menthone in the prevention of ACV adverse effects was compared.
   Materials and methods: Albino Wister adult male rats with mean weight of 200-250 g were divided randomly into six groups. Treatment groups consisted of acyclovir (ACV) at the dose of 15mg/kg/d, ACV (15mg/kg/d) and VC at the dose of 20mg/kg/d, ACV (15mg/kg/d) and menthone at the dose of 100 mu l/d, ACV (15mg/kg/d) and menthone at the dose of250 mu l/d, ACV (15mg/kg/d) and menthone at the dose of 400 mu l/d and control group ended the trial period without any treatment. The animals were anesthetized and epididymal sperm cells from each rats were isolated in PBS to evaluate the expression of caspase3 enzyme by flow cytometry method.
   Results: The present results demonstrated a very strong supportive, protective effect along with impressive anti-apoptotic role of VC. The expression level of caspase 3 in VC receiving group was close to normal levels. Menthone, another antioxidant compound in the high dose level showed to have a strong anti-apoptotic power, against changes induced by ACV.

AB Introduction: Acute Renal Injury (ARI) is a constant problem for patients in intensive care and Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) is an ever-more important part of acute renal injury (ARI) treatment. Various criteria have been used for the diagnosis and classification of acute renal failure, including RIFLE (Risk-Injury-Failure-Loss-End stage), AKIN (Acute Kidney Injury Network) and most recently KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes). Many studies have only evaluated urinary output or serum creatinine when categorizing ARI. Our aim was to determine the predictors of mortality in intensive care patients treated with CRRT and to compare mortality with ARI level as determined by KDIGO-Serum Creatinine (KDIGO-SCr) and KDIGO-urinary output (KDIGO-UO)
   Materials and methods: This retrospective study was performed on intensive care patients receiving CRRT at our institute between January 2010-December 2011. Patient files were reviewed and demographic data, hospitalization time, laboratory findings, CRRT commencement and ARI levels were noted.
   Results: Seventy patients were included in the study. Mortality was found to be associated with patients' age, Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and adjusted predicted death rate. (p<0,01). Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) area under the curve was statistically significant for determination of mortality using KDIGO-SCR (p<0.01) although the same was not true for KDIGO-UO (p>0.05).
   Conclusions: We believe that RIFLE, AKIN, KDIGO criteria are each good predictors of mortality. In the case of KDIGO criteria, based solely on serum creatinine or urinary output, KDIGO-SCr was found to be a better predictor of mortality when compared to KDIGO-UO.

AB Introduction: Oxidative stress is increasingly recognized as an important factor in the progression of chronic liver disease of varying etiologies and antioxidants are utilized in the treatment of some of them. Chronic viral hepatitis D continues to be a significant health problem in certain regions of the world. Rates of response to currently proposed treatments are rather low. The aim of this study was to investigate oxidative stress in patients with chronic viral hepatitis D.
   Materials and methods: A total of 91 patients with chronic hepatitis D virus infection were included in this study (mean age: 42.2 +/- 11.7). In addition, 40 healthy volunteers were included in the study to form the control group. Patients were divided into two main sub-groups as cirrhotic (n=30) and non-cirrhotic (n=61) groups. Blood samples were taken from both patients and control subjects and compared for total oxidant status (TOS), total anti-oxidant status (TAS) and oxidative stress index (OSI).
   Results: TOS levels were significantly higher in the patients compared to the control sub-jects (p<0.001). Moreover, TOS levels were higher in the cirrhotic patients compared to the non-cirrhotic patients (p=0.006). TAS levels were significantly lower in the patients compared to the control subjects (p=0.003). OSI levels were significantly higher in the patients compared to the control subjects (p<0.001). Moreover, OSI levels were higher in the cirrhotic patients compared to the non-cirrhotic patients (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: These results are supportive of the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of chronic viral hepatitis D. Antioxidant therapies might be considered in patients with chronic viral hepatitis D considering the presence of oxidative stress in these patients.

AB Introduction: Prolidase, cytosolic exopeptidase, is important in the final step of degradation in collagen metabolism and cell growth. The aim of this study is to investigate the prolidase enzyme levels as a disease activity indicator in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
   Materials and methods: The study included 60 patients diagnosed with RA according to the 2010 RA Classification Criteria and 30 healthy controls. The patients were divided into subgroups according to the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS 28), as low disease activity (DAS 28 <= 3,2) and high disease activity (DAS 28 > 5,1). Serum prolidase activity (SPA) was determined by a photometric method based on the measurement of the proline levels produced by prolidase.
   Results: There were significant differences between RA patients and healthy controls with respect to prolidase activity. Prolidase activity was significantly higher in the patients with RA than those of the controls (P = 0.001). However, no statistically significant difference was found between the high and low disease activity groups. In correlative analysis, prolidase positively correlated with rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies.
   Conclusion: Increased prolidase levels are related to increased oxidative damage, bone and collagen turnover. SPA in clinical practice may be a useful method for predicting the joint erosion and progression of the disease.

AB Introduction: Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common pathology that can occur during and after vascular surgeries and organ transplantation. Although multiple agents have been used to minimize this pathology, I/R injury remains a challenging problem. In this study, we investigated the effectivity of escin on hepatic I/R injury.
   Materials and methods: Hepatic I/R injury was determined in rats by the clamping of the hepatic artery and portal vein for 60 minutes, followed by 60-minute reperfusion. Escin 10 mg/kg (i.p.) was administered 30 minutes prior to ischemia and 30 minutes prior to reperfusion. Liver function tests were evaluated by the assessment of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, the radical oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated by the assessment of malondialdehyde (MDA), and the antioxidant activity was evaluated by the assessment of glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Samples of liver tissues were histopathologically evaluated.
   Results: The results revealed that serum AST, ALT, and LDH and the MDA levels were lower both in the pre-ischemia and pre-reperfusion escin groups. The CAT and SOD levels were higher in the pre-reperfusion escin group. Histopathologic injury was lower in the rats administered with escin.
   Discussion: In this study, it was demonstrated that escin provides useful outcomes since it reduces ROS formation when administered prior to ischemia and removes ROS when administered prior to reperfusion.

AB Introduction: The aim of the study was to assess the presence and severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and erectile dysfunction (ED) in the drug and alcohol addicted population.
   Materials and methods: Alcohol and drug abuse groups constituted of male abusers who presented to a local Alcohol and Drug Abuse Research Center. Control groups were composed of age-matched healthy men who denied any drug/alcohol abuse. Each group was composed of 30 men. Beck Depression and Anxiety Scales, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OAB-V8), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) and sexual satisfaction scale were the tools applied to the subjects and controls. Additionally, maximum (Qmax) and average urinary flow rates (Qave) were recorded for statistical assessment in all groups.
   Results: The mean age, number of children, number of siblings, were comparable between the subjects and controls (p> 0.05). LUTS and ED were more prevalent in drug and alcohol abusers when compared with their controls. Higher mean depression and anxiety scores of the drug and alcohol abusers highlighted their worse psychological status. The quality of life and sexual satisfaction assessment of the drug abusers yielded significantly lower results when compared with their controls. Regarding the comparison between alcohol addicts and their controls; quality of life scores were significantly higher whereas sexual satisfaction assessment results were comparable. The Qave values were similar between drug abusers and their controls while mean Qave was significantly higher in the alcohol addicts than their controls.
   Conclusion: ED and LUTS are more prevalent in alcohol and drug abusers when compared to healthy controls. It can be proposed that alcohol and drug addiction should be considered in the etiology of ED and LUTS especially in young adult population.

AB Purpose: The aim of this study is to assess the awareness of the diabetic retinopathy and the level of the diabetic retinopathy in the diabetic patients, which consulted to the state hospitals in Turkey.
   Methods: A total of 1071 patients, admitted to 8 different state hospitals' ophthalmology clinics around the country, were included to this cross sectional multicentred study. All diabetic patients were asked to respond specifically prepared questionnaire including diabetic retinopathy and diabetes mellitus and underwent fundus examination to assess the diabetic retinopathy level.
   Results: The mean age of the study population was 57.5 years and the 57.4 % of the patients were women. 34.7% of the patients' were responded "NO" to the question of "Are you aware of the eye complications of diabetes mellitus?". The study also showed that 200 of 699 patients (28.6%) who aware of the diabetic retinopathy, despite having this information do not have regular eye examination for the diabetic retinopathy. It was seen that even 40.62% (26/64) of the college graduates don't go regular checks. The majority of the aware patients (40.5 %) pointed out that they took information from internal medicine or endocrinologists and the 28.1% of the patients were informed from elsewhere (family, neighbor, TV, etc.).
   Conclusion: One third of the subjects monitored were not aware of diabetic retinopathy. It is noteworthy to emphasize the importance of the routine eye examination for preventing vision loss, regardless of the educational level. The warning of the physicians through written and visual media is thought to be effective in preventing irreversible condition of this disease.

AB Aim: Oxidative stress has crucial effects over vascular pathophysiology of Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA), and contributes atherosclerosis at advanced stages of the disease. In contrast to be acknowledged the possible role of Fetuin-A in the development of atherosclerosis, its association with vascular changes in SCA appears to warrant further investigation. In the study, we aimed to illuminate vascular pathophysiology of SCA via investigating Fetuin-A levels and its relationship with oxidative stress parameters.
   Material and methods: Fourty SCA patients and and 35 healthy individuals (n: 35) were included in the study all. After analyzing hematological data, Malondialdehyde (MDA), Glutathione Peroxidase (GSH-Px), Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT) were measured throughout preparing hemolysate from samples with EDTA. Fetuin-A was analyzed from serum samples.
   Results: Fetuin-A (p<0.001) and MDA levels (p<0.001) were measured significantly higher in SCA group. Similarly, G6PD (p<0.001) and SOD (p<0.01) enzyme activities were determined higher in SCA when compared to the control group. A novel positive correlation was found among Fetuin-A, G6PD (r=0.435, p<0.0001) and MDA (r=0.547, p<0.0001). However, there was no statistical significance between the groups for CAT and GSH-Px. ROC analyze suggested 0,97 ng/mL as the cutoff value for Fetuin-A (Area Under the Curve: 0.713, sensitivity: 62%, specificity: 80%, p:0,002) and 0,06 mu mol/gr Hb as the cutoff value for MDA (Area Under the Curve: 0.898, sensitivity: 87 %, specificity: 80%, p:<0,001).
   Conclusion: Elevated Fetuin-A in patients with SCA and its positive correlations with both MDA and G6PD suggested that Fetuin-A might have an important role for pathophysiology of SCA. Additionally, Fetuin-A may be useful for evaluating severity of disease with high specificity cutoff value as MDA.

AB Aim: Infectious gastroenteritis is one of the most significant causes of morbidity and mortality, particularly in children. Rotavirus and enteric adenovirus are among the most common causes of viral diarrhoea among young children worldwide. The aim of this study of samples sent to the laboratory with an initial diagnosis of gastroenteritis was to define the prevalence of rotavirus and enteric adenovirus according to age and seasonal distribution.
   Materials and methods: The presence of rotavirus and enteric adenovirus antigens was researched using a qualitative immunochromatographic method in stool samples from patients with gastroenteritis who were admitted to Ondokuz Maps University Hospital between January 2009 and April 2013. Chi-square tests were used for comparisons between groups.
   Results: Of the 2185 stool samples examined, 343 were determined to be positive for rotavirus antigen and 157 for adenovirus antigen. The highest rate of rotavirus antigen positivity (212 cases, 62%) was seen in the 0-23 months age group. Seasonally, rotavirus gastroenteritis was seen mostly in winter (144 cases, 42%). The highest rate of adenovirus positive samples was determined in the 0-23 month's age group (86 cases, 55%). The distribution of the adenovirus cases in autumn, winter, spring and summer was 54 (34%), 31 (20%), 27 (17%) and 45 (29%) cases, respectively. Sixty-three specimens (3% of cases) were positive for both antigens.
   Conclusion: As rotavirus and adenovirus were found to be significant factors in gastroenteritis in the 0-23 months age group, in the differential diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis in this age group of patients, it is important to consider rotavirus as a factor, particularly in the winter months, while adenovirus should be considered in summer and autumn. Rotavirus and adenovirus can be diagnosed quickly by the immunochromatographic test from stool samples, making it possible to prevent the development of dehydration and the unnecessary use of antibiotics.

ID CRISIS
AB Introduction: Cortisol, which is released from the adrenal cortex, is a steroid hormone with vital functions. Its daily release is regulated by the hypothalamic-hypophyseal-adrenal axis. In healthy people, an adequate amount of endogenous corticosteroids is synthesized in the adrenal gland in response to stressful events, but in patients with adrenal insufficiency, there is a steroid synthesis defect that prevents the patient's requirements from being met. It may be challenging to diagnose corticosteroid deficiency in some circumstances, which can lead to catastrophic consequences, including death.
   Case presentation: In this article, we report a patient who had been using prednisolone 5mg/day for 10 years for rheumatoid arthritis with acute gastroenteritis whose clinical condition deteriorated despite appropriate therapy for 1 week and who was subsequently diagnosed with secondary adrenal insufficiency.
   Conclusion: On the basis of this case report, we remind clinicians of the necessity of rearranging steroid therapy during the course of an infectious disease in patients previously treated with prolonged steroid therapy.

ID EDUCATION
AB Objectives: This study was conducted to determine the effect of tutorial videos on the self-efficacy of tracheostomy patients. Background: Patients with a tracheostomy need long term care at home and improving their self-efficacy can be helpful in better care.
   Methods: This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 80 patients with a tracheotomy randomized into two groups. At the time of discharge and after routine trainings, the intervention group was given a CD containing the routine training for patient care to be watched at home. After two months, the participants completed the self-efficacy questionnaires again.
   Results: Statistical analysis showed that after two months the comparison of the mean of the two groups intervention group (from 32.87 +/- 4.49 to 35.46 +/- 3.24) and control group (from 35.60 +/- 6.95 to 35.30 +/- 5. 95) was significantly different (p=0.0001).
   Conclusions: The use of tutorial videos is an effective way for improving self-efficacy of patients with tracheostomy. Thus, it is recommended that this instructional method be utilized in training programs for medical personnel to be used for this group of patients.
   Practice Implications: The healthcare team, especially nurses, can use this educational method to improve the self-efficacy of patients with tracheostomy at the time of discharge as a complementary method.

AB Introduction: Metastasis of an unknown primary site in liver, lung, lymph nodes and soft tissue is not rare, and in these patients, immunohistochemical findings may have an effect on the therapeutic implications and prognosis. Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is a transcription factor which plays an important role in the normal physiology of the thyroid and lungs. TTF-1 is highly specific and sensitive in the diagnosis of certain types of primary lung and thyroid carcinomas and immunohistochemical TTF-1 positivity may be used as a marker of malignancies metastasized from lung and thyroid. Although they are used extensively in daily pathological practice, detailed study of this antibody in some of neoplasms that may show difficulties in differential diagnosis is lacking. In this study, we aimed to determine the usefulness of TTF-1 positivity in the differential diagnosis of gastric carcinomas from lung malignancies.
   Materials and methods: We examined TTF-1 expression in primary adenocarcinoma and non-cohesive carcinoma of the stomach. Surgical resection materials from 132 patients with gastric carcinoma were evaluated. The diagnosis of primary site was identified for all cases by clinical, radiological and/or histological correlation and the possibility of metastatic carcinoma was excluded. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the tissue-microarray block sections.
   Results. Among 123 gastric carcinomas, 4 (3.25%) cases showed strong nuclear positivity with TTF-1. None of the 9 poorly cohesive gastric carcinomas stained for TTF-1.
   Conclusions: In summary, our results show that TTF-1 positivity may be observed especially in gastric adenocarchioma.

AB Introduction: Fatigue is one of the most important symptoms of multiple sclerosis where in majority of patients that often suffer from it are young individuals in active life stage. This study was carried out with an aim to assess the effectiveness of psychological Training with gradual muscle relaxation technique on fatigue in multiple sclerosis patients.
   Material and methods: In this triple blind placebo-controlled clinical trial study, 60 multiple sclerosis patients that were Multiple Sclerosis Association Members of Yazd Province via an easy sampling method and considering the input and output criteria entered the study. The samples were randomly divided into two groups of test (30 persons) and control (30 persons) respectively, and test group received 12 sessions of psychological education with gradual muscle relaxation technique, two sessions a week, whereas for control group nil intervention were adopted. The information was collected using a demographic questionnaire and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Prior to intervention, immediately and three months after an intervention. For analysis of information the statistical tests; Pearson correlation, Repeated measures and t-student was used.
   Results: Considering that the patients were randomly divided into two groups of test and control, prior to education did not exhibit a statistical difference in the demographic characteristics, disease duration, body mass index, fatigue scale of patients. (P>0.05). The fatigue scale in the test and control groups prior to the intervention were 41.9 +/- 6.666 and 42.833 +/- 8.363, respectively, immediately after the intervention were 41 +/- 6.103 and 33.9 +/- 7.073, respectively, and three months after an intervention were 41.1 +/- 6.567 and 35.567 +/- 7.61, respectively and this difference from statistical viewpoint was significant (P<0.001). Likewise, the Repeated measures statistical test showed a significant reduction in the Fatigue Severity Scale in the education group in triple measurements (P<0.00001).
   Conclusion: The psychological Training with gradual muscle relaxation technique in the multiple sclerosis patients can lead to reduction of fatigue scale. Therefore, this method can be safely suggested as an effective and affordable in terms of cost and time for multiple sclerosis patients.

AB Objective: The present study was conducted in attempt to identify reliable biomarkers in predicting the severity of neurological injury.
   Materials and methods: A number of 30 patients with confirmed CO poisoning and a number of 7 healthy control volunteers were involved into the study. All participants received at least 60 minutes of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2) at 2.5 atmospheres absolute (ATA). Standard blood gas analysis was performed on 10 mL venous blood samples obtained immediately before and after HBO2. Seven biomarkers and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels were measured.
   Results: Following HBO2, all patients recovered fully and were discharged in stable condition. Significant differences between pre and post HBO2 values were found in three of the seven biomarkers analyzed: TNF-alpha, IL-10, and S100B. Additionally, S100B and NSE levels were significantly different from controls for the 10 patients who experienced temporary loss of consciousness (LOC), and IL-6 levels were significantly different from controls for all CO-intoxicated patients.
   Conclusion: Conclusive evidence of a correlation between a single biomarker and LOC patients was not found. However, the data suggests that the significance of the fall between pre and post HBO2 values for TNF-alpha and IL-10, along with the resolution of IL-6 levels, may herald the severity of the patient's neurological condition.

AB The classical-deterministic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model has played an important role in the analysis of epidemic systems with large populations. However, when population numbers become small e.g. in a hospital ward, a stochastic analysis will be vital. The stochastic. Petri-Nets using Gillespie algorithm for modeling the transmission of airborne infections in enclosed spaces is present to be incorporated into an SIR epidemic model with a short incubation period to simulate the transmission dynamics of airborne infectious diseases in indoor environments. The stochastic model not only allows the long-term impact of infection control measures and enables the evaluation of environmental factors, but also depicts the probability of an outbreak of an airborne infection. A quantitative performance study was carried out to demonstrate how to limit the probability rate of outbreak of infection.

AB Introduction: Breast cancer and intraductal papillary lesions and their association with nipple discharge (ND) are well known. Joint detection of serum and ND tumor markers is of great importance and effective in judgment of progression and prognosis of disease. In the present study, we observed the therapeutic effects of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) on breast cancer and to validate whether Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and HIF-1 alpha in tissue and CA153 and CA125 in nipple discharge and serum may be used as predictors of mammary cancer therapeutic effects.
   Materials and methods: COX-2 and HIF-1 alpha expression in breast tissue was performed by means of immunohistochemistry in 128 cases of invasive ductal cancer (IDC), 89 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 57 cases of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), and 60 cases of usual duct hyperplasia (UDH) lesions, and we analyzed the relationship and clinical outcomes.
   Results: Our data demonstrate that CA153 and CA125 levels had a positive correlation with COX-2 and HIF-1 a, and the four biomarkers abnormally increased in mammary cancer correlate with poor clinicopathological parameters such as invasion and metastasis, related to worse progndsis and shorter overall survival (P<0.05). TCM combined with western medicine therapy significantly relieved the clinical Chinese medical symptoms and decreased CA153 and CA125 levels.
   Conclusions: Serum and nipple discharge CA153 and CA125 levels had a positive correlation with COX-2 and HIF-1 alpha, and the four biomarkers abnormally increased in mammary cancer correlate with poor clinicopathological parameters such as invasion and metastasis, related to worse prognosis and shorter overall survival. TCM combined with western medicine significantly relieved the clinical medical symptoms and reduced CA153 and CA125 levels.

AB In order to improve quality of life for infertility patients and relieve their adverse emotional state, this paper conducted in-depth analysis and research of the clinical effect of implementation of comprehensive nursing intervention on the treatment process of infertility patients. A total of 3800 patients who had been treated for infertility in some 10 hospitals from June 2014 to June 2015 were selected as study subjects. Among them, 2500 patients,who decided to receive fine nursing in the treatment process after discussion with doctors and family members were selected as observation group; the remaining 1300 patients who didn't receive comprehensive nursing intervention due to various reasons but received routine nursing care in the treatment process were selected as a control group. The preferred infertility patients in this study received 8 weeks of nursing intervention. After completion of nursing, a comparison of the psychological state of anxiety and depression and quality of lift of the two groups of patients revealed that various indicators of the observation group patients with comprehensive nursing intervention improved, patient psychological mood moved in a more positive direction, life attitude was more positive and patients were more willing to cooperate in the treatment. Hence, the therapeutic effect was significantly better than that of the control group. Therefore, this clinical research fully confirms the great role of comprehensive nursing intervention in the clinical treatment of infertility patients. It is recommended that comprehensive nursing intervention should be promoted in the actual clinical process.

   C677T Polymorphisms
AB Incidence of congenital heart disease (CHD) has been shown to be hereditary.:To clarify the relationship between polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene C677T and congenital heart disease, this study selected 1,500 children with simple congenital heart disease treated in 10 hospitals from January 2012 to June 2015 as study group and 1500 healthy children who received physical examinations in hospital in the same period as reference group. To ensure accuracy of the results, there was no significant statistical difference in distribution of basic information of the selected 3,000 children. For the polymerase chain reaction the restriction fragment length polymorphism method was adopted to detect MTHFR C677T, A1298C, G1793A genotype and the corresponding distribution of the two groups of children. The result is a significant association between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene C677T polymorphism in the mother's body and incidence risk of children with congenital heart disease. Hence, C677T represents one of the,main factors causing congenital heart disease.

DE Gypsum Fibrosum; FTIR; Fingerprint; derivative spectrum
AB Introduction: Chinese mineral medicine plays an important part in Traditional Chinese Medicine and has a long history, such as using Gypsum Fibrosum. Aim of our study is to establish a new Gypsum Fibrosum identification method and compare Gypsum Fibrosum and CaSO4 with the help of Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
   Materials and methods: Determination and analysis of batches of Gypsum Fibrosum samples to establish the fingerprint by the OPUS acquisition system obtained from the German Bruker TENSOR 37 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and then compare the Gypsum Fibrosum and CaSO4 by initial characteristic spectrogram, first derivative spectrum and second derivative spectrum.
   Results: The similarity of twenty-four samples were calculated by SPSS20, which showed that the correlation coefficient of twenty-four batches of samples was more than 0.980, except for No.16. There were distinctions of the wave number, peak position, spike and peak intensity between Gypsum Fibrosum and CaSO4 in the derivative spectroscopy. In view of the difference between Gypsum Fibrosum and CaSO4, a conclusion may be that there is a structural change.
   Discussion: Gypsum Fibrosum can be studied by FTIR and differences obtained between mineral medicine and the analytical reagent on the analysis of sulfate mineral. In addition, the result shows that it can provide a new, rapid and specific method for identification of Gypsum Fibrosum by FTIR.

TI ON THE EFFECT OF HEALTH INSURANCE ON CHINESE RURAL ELDERS' HEALTH DEMAND

DE Health Insurance; Rural Elders; Health Demand
AB We applied data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) between 2005 and 2008 to study the effect of health insurance on Chinese rural elders' health demand, and found that health insurance significantly increased Chinese rural elders' total health expenditure by 19%. However, it neither lengthened their life expectancy significantly nor decreased their mortality risk. Hence, the Chinese rural elders' excessive demand induced by health insurance was apparently inefficient. Thus,. government should try to improve health care for rural elders in China and control unreasonable increases in health care costs in order to insure that rural elders are treated when really ill.

AB Introduction: To systemically compare the characteristics of integrin beta 2 signaling pathways related gene expressions among acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, stable angina pectoris (SA) patients and healthy controls.
   Materials and methods: 20 AMI patients, SA patients and healthy people were enrolled into AMI, SA and control groups respectively. Gene expressions associated with signaling pathways of integrin 132 of three groups were detected and compared by t test.
   Results: Compared with controls, mRNA expressions of alpha/beta subunit (ITGAD, ITGAL, ITGAM, ITGAX and ITGB2), ligands of integrin beta 2 (RAGE, JAM-1, Fibrinogen, ICAM-1, ICAM-3, ICAM-5 and uPAR), chemokine (fMLP and RAF), inside-out signaling pathway (RIAM, ADAP, SLP-76, PLC gamma, RAPL, SPA1, alpha-actinin, calpain, Dok1, radixin, talin and 14-3-3 zeta) and outside-in signaling pathway (Fgr, Hck, Lyn, PKC, c-abl, Syk, Vav1/3, cdc42, mDia, Rac, RhoA and ROCK1/2) in AMI patients were significantly upregulated. However there was no significant difference of gene expressions of integrin beta 2 and its signaling pathway in SA patients compared to control group.
   Conclusions: The inside-out signaling pathway was downregulated generally in AMI patients, but not in SA patients. However, the outside-in signaling pathway was activated to be upregulated in AMI patients, but not in SA patients. Thus, the activation of integrin beta 2 was irritated by external factors.

AB Crowd behavior in group incidents is often like herd behavior. Neuroscience is an emerging research field, which contributes to revealing the mechanisms of decision-making behavior. This study investigated the influence of emotion on decision-making in herd behavior and the cognitive characteristics in group incidents from a two-stage experiment. The behavior data demonstrated that herd behavior really existed in group incidents, and interaction between emotion and participation rate influenced the decision making. When participation, rate was 0% or 25%, compared with the negative emotion, decision makers who felt positive emotion tended to choose not to participate in the herd behavior. When the rate rose to 75%, compared with the positive emotion, the decision-makers in negative emotion may be more inclined to herd behavior. The ERP analysis of the emotion presentation demonstrated, an increased early, negativity (NI) and attenuated early negativity (N2) elicited by an angry or sorrowful mood compared with positive emotion. The weakness of early negativity (N2) would make people experience less struggle while making decisions, and it also led to an increase in the amplitude of P3, which reduced the difficulty of decision making.

AB Introduction: dysfunction (ED). The Aim of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics properties of avanafil and its analogues.
   Materials and methods: After extraction by acetonitrile, the analytes were separated by a rapid gradient elution with acetonitrile and water as the mobile phase and detected by an mass spectrometer. Multiple reaction monitoring was performed on the ion transitions of m/z 484.2 -> 375.2 [M-H] - (avanafil).
   Results: A simple, rapid and accurate liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed for the quantification of avanafil and its analogues in rat plasma using Dixipan as the internal standard (IS). The plasma concentration of avanafil and its analogues in rats showed good linearity. All the analytes can maintain stable during the whole experimental process.
   Discussion: The developed method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of avanafil and its analogues after oral administration to rats. The results showed that the analogues have better absorption property in vivo than avanafil.

AB Objective: Polyphosphate (polyP) is a linear polymer of inorganic phosphate generally found in fungi, algae, protozoa and mammalian cells. However, clinical evidence in humans is lacking.
   Methods: We investigated plasma long chain polyP levels in the plasma of 10 healthy volunteers (control group), 10 myocardial infarction patients, 10 cerebral infarction patients, 10 deep vein thrombosis (lower extremity) patients, 52 consolidation therapy patients, and 30 infectious fever patients using a step extraction method and DAPI staining.
   Results: We found no significant differences between thrombosis patients and healthy subjects. However, plasma long chain polyP levels in the infectious fever patients were higher than those in the healthy group and consolidation therapy patients. Plasma polyP levels decreased after infectious fever had been relieved. Plasmapheresis could reduce plasma long chain polyP levels and clinical symptoms.
   Cconclusions: We did not observe a relationship between long chain polyP levels and thrombosis. By contrast, we found evidence that long chain polyP promotes infectious fever. After patient recovery, long chain polyP levels returned to normal, and we found that plasmapheresis can reduce the burden of long chain polyP and related symptoms in patients.

AB Introduction: Methamphetamine is a stimulant and addictive substance which strongly stimulates brain and nervous system and has a higher chemical effect as compared to amphetamine. There is no uniform biologic therapy for the abuse of this substance. Therapeutic focuses are centralized on psychological interventions. The present research aimed at examining the effectiveness of Levinson-based cognitive-behavioral therapy on psychological well-being of methamphetamine-dependent patients.
   Materials and methods: Research method was of quasi-experimental type and sample size included 30 methamphetamine-dependent men who were selected through convenience sampling method and were randomly divided into two groups, namely experiment group (n=15) and control group (n=15). The Ryff Psychological Well-being Scales were used for data collection. In the data analysis process, frequency, mean and standard deviation were used for descriptive data and covariance analysis was used for inferential analyses.
   Results: The results showed that overall average of psychological well-being in experimental group was higher in the post-test stage than in pre-test stage. Moreover, the results of covariance analysis showed that there was a significant difference between experimental and control groups in the post-test stage (P<0.001).
   Conclusion: Considering the obtained results it can be concluded that Levinson-based cognitive-behavioral therapy was effective in increasing the psychological well-being of methamphetamine-dependent individuals. In this way, psychologists and counselors working at drug abuse treatment centers are recommended to use Levinson-based cognitive-behavioral therapy together with pharmacologic treatments and alleviate physical symptoms to increase psychological well-being.

AB Background: Remifentanil is one of the most using adjuvant drug in rapid sequence intubation (RSI) because of its ultrashort action but there is no evidence to compare its effect with muscle relaxant. The aim of present was to assess and compare the effect of Remifentanil with Atracurium as a muscle relaxant in intubation condition
   Material and methods: In this double-blinded clinical trial 66 patients scheduled for elective surgery with general anesthesia and tracheal intubation were selected and receivedpropofol 2.5 mg/kg IV and Atropine 0.5 mg IV, thenrandomlydivided into two groups; group A received Atracurium 0.5 mg/kg and group R received Remifentanil 2 mu g/kg intravenously. Intubation conditionusing criteria based on jaw relaxation, vocal cord movement and bucking on tracheal tube recorded 90 and 180 second after remifentanil and Atracurium administration respectively, and compared between groups.
   Results: The mean age of participants was 31.55 +/- 13.213 years, and 46 (69.7%) were men. Tracheal intubation of all patients were successful in first attempt. In Remifentanil group jaw joint was not fully relaxed in 3 patients. Moving vocal cords were seen in 6 and 3 patients of Remifentanil and Atracurium group respectively and closed vocal cords in 2 patients in Remifentanil group. There was no significant difference between intubating conditions and response to intubation variables between study groups (p= NS). The result of intubation was significantly better in Atracurium group (p= 0.023).
   Conclusion: According to the result of present study Remifentanil without muscle relaxant can make acceptable intubation condition. More studies to find optimal dose of remifentanil in RSI are needed.

AB Introduction: A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method based on color change for rapid detection of the food-borne E. coli O157:H7 had been designed by targeting rfbE, stx1 and stx2 genes and evaluated in this study.
   Materials and methods: Amplification of DNA was monitored through visual inspection of calcein pre-addition and 2% agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE). The optimal reaction system was found to be composed of 150 mM Mg-2+, 50 mu M calcein as well as the 1:8 ratio of Mn-2+ and calcein. Orange to green color change and ladder like multiple bands of different sizes could be inspected in only E. coli O157:H7.
   Results: The sensitivity of LAMP assays was approximately 10 pg/mu L and significantly prior to 10 ng/mu L of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In the parallel diagnosis of 66 E. coli samples, 36 (54.55%) strains were positive for rfbE. Of these 36 O157:H7, 31 (86.11%) and 29 (80.56%) were positive for stx1 and stx2, respectively.
   Conclusion: the colorimetric LAMP assay based on rfbE gene was established and optimized. All the results indicated that the improved LAMP assay satisfied the basic demand for gene diagnose and could be used in the rapid detection of E. coli O157:H7.

AB Introduction: Phyllodes tumor of the breast is a rare fibroepithelial breast tumor that usually ocur in adult females. They are composed of a benign epithelial component and a cellular, spindle cell stroma forming a leaf-like structure. No one morphologic finding is reliable in predicting the clinical behavior of the tumor. The rarity of phyllodes tumor and similarity to fibroadenoma necessitate studies and case series presentations delineating differential characteristics. We aimed to present our phylloides tumor experience to make contribution to the knowledge in the literature.
   Materials and method: This retrospective study includes 414 patients (62 Phyllodes tumor and 352 fibroadenoma)that were diagnosed and treated at Izmir Bozyaka Education and Research Hospital between January 2005 and January 2013. Patients demographic findings, tumor characteristics, diagnostic and treatment modalities and also their follow-up results were examined. Multivariate regression analysis and ROC curve were structured in order to see the significance.
   Results: The mean age was 42.5 (22-62) and mean tumor diameter was 4.4 (1,2-15) cm in phylloides tumor group. Breast preserving surgery was the preferred treatment of 52 and total mastectomy in 10 patients out of 62 phylloides tumor. The mean follow up time interval was 51 and 66 months for breast preserving and mastectomy patients respectively in phylloides tumor group. Recurrent cases in phylloides tumor group were respectively (12.5%) and 5 (12.5%) in breast preserving and mastectomy patients. Tumor size and patients age were found to be concordant with the type of histopathology (benign, borderline and malignant) of the phylloides tumor. Tumor size was found to be correlated with phylloides tumor diagnosis rather than fibroadenoma.
   Conclusion: Histopathologically more aggressive phylloides tumor is more likely in bigger tumor size and older age. This is also true in differential diagnosis of fibroadenoma in suspicion of phylloides tumor. The lesions greater than 3 cm should always be surgically excised with clear surgical margins.

ID ISCHEMIC-STROKE; SUBTYPES
AB Introduction: Stroke is the second most cause of death worldwide after coronary artery disease. Left-sided atrial septal pouch (LASP) is associated with potential cardioembolic stroke. This study determines the association between LASP and cryptogenic stroke (CS) using cardiac multi-detector computed tomography (cMDCT) angiograms.
   Materials and methods: This study included 40 patients with CS (23 males, mean age: 403 +/- 10.4 years) and 40 age- and sex matched healthy controls. cMDCT examinations by dual-source 64-slice MDCT with 0.6-mm slice thickness were performed for all patients and controls. The association between LASP and risk of CS was assessed after adjustment for other stroke risk factors.
   Results: Patients with LASP were younger than control subjects (41.3 +/- 7.2 years vs 44.2 +/- 5.7 years; p = 0.066), with a comparable prevalence of hypertension (42.5% vs 35%; p = 0.491) and other risk factors. There were no differences in the prevalence of LASP between patients and controls (32.5% vs 25%; p = 0.621). LASP was observed in 43.5% (n = 10) of normotensive stroke patients compared to 15.4% (n = 4) of normotensive controls (Odds Ratio (OR): 4.23, 95% CI: 1.09-16.27, p = 0.063). On the other hand, LASP was detected in 17.6% (n = 3) of hypertensive CS patients compared to 42.9% (n = 6) of hypertensive controls (OR: 028, 95% CI: 0.05-4.23, p = 0.253). The presence of LASP was not associated with an increased risk of CS.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that LASP is associated with CS. However, in normotensive individuals, LASP may be a minor risk factor for CS.

AB Objective:Allergy commonly affects the upper and lower airways concurrently. Although allergic inflammations effects on nasal and pulmonary diseases have been well described, allergic inflammations effects on the larynx are not completely well understood. We investigated the prevalence of allergy in patients with benign lesions of the vocal folds and types of allergens causing these reactions.
   Materials and methods: Laryngeal examination was done by rigid laryngoscope and lesions of each patients were recorded. All patients underwent skin prick tests on the forearm with a fall set of 35 common allergens.
   Results: Forty patients (15 male and 25 female) with vocal fold pathology were included. Twenty two (55%) subject swere affected by vocal polyps, 12 (27.5%) by nodules, 7 (17.5%) by Reinke's edema. Skin prick tests resulted positive in 60% of the patients. The most common allergen found was mite mixture (47,5%) and weed mixture (42.5%).
   Conclusion: Skin prick tests were found to be highy positive in patients with benign lesions of vocal folds compared to normal population. Further research is needed to identify the underlying pathways mediating the laryngeal response to allergy to develop better diagnostic and therapeutic techniques.

AB Introduction: The present study was conducted to assess the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and metabolic syndrome score (MSS) and insulin resistance and beta cell function in Korean adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
   Material and method: This study included 541 adults with T2DM using 2010 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data.
   Results: The key study results were as follows: First, after adjusted for the related variables [age, gender, smoking, drinking, exercising, TC, 25(OH)D, and BMI], metabolic syndrome (p = 0.967) and MSS increases (p = 0.131) were not significantly associated with the HOMA-IR levels. Second, after adjusting the related variables (except BMI), MetS (p = 0.264) and MSS increases (p = 0.359) were not significantly associated with HOMA-B levels. However, when further adjusted for BMI, MetS (p = 0.004) and MSS increases (p = 0.010) were inversely associated with HOMA-B levels.
   Conclusion: Metabolic syndrome and increase of metabolic syndrome score were inversely associated with beta cell function, but were not independently associated with insulin resistance in Korean adults with T2DM.

AB Introduction: Lycorine is a natural alkaloid, existing largly in the Amaryllidaceae plant family. It has a wide range of pharmacological activity. Recent studies have found that lycorine has significant effect on the hematological malignancies. However, the effect of lycorine on the Human breast cancer MCF-7 cells (MCF-7) are not clear. In this context, we studied that lycorine induced the apoptosis of MCF-7 cells, and explored the possible mechanism of it.
   Materials and methods: The MCF-7 cells were treated with different concentrations of lycorine for 72h. The inhibition rate of the MCF-7 cells was detected with Brominated tetrazolium (MTT) assay, cell morphology was observed using an inverted microscope, the change of cell intracellular calcium and membrane potential was detected with confocal laser scanning microscope.
   Results: MTT assay showed that lycorine could inhibit the MCF-7 growth in dose-dependent manner after 72h. The MCF-7 cells were rupture and dead under inverted microscope. Calcium concentration in MCF-7 cells significantly increased and membrane potential were decreased in dose-dependent manner.
   Disscussion: These results showed that lycorine could inhibit the MCF-7 cells growth and induce it apoptosis, the mechanism might involve an initiation of apoptosis signals in the mitochondrial pathway. This research first discovered anti-tumor mechanism of lycorine on MCF-7 cells.

TI SPONTANEOUS ISOLATED CELIAC AND SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY DISSECTION:
   CASE REPORT WITH LITERATURE REVIEW
SO ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA

DT Article
DE celiac artery; dissection; superior mesenteric artery
ID STENT PLACEMENT; MANAGEMENT
AB Introduction: Spontaneous isolated celiac and superior mesenteric artery dissection is rare, but it might have been underestimated due to the possibly occult presenting symptoms and good outcomes. The natural history is unpredicatable due to its large variations of the clinical features.
   Case presentation: A 50-year-old patient had complained of abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography revealed spontaneous isolated celiac and superior mesenteric artery dissection. He was conservatively managed with nitroglycerin infusion, atropine injection and warfarin intake and his pain was relieved soon.
   Conclusions: There have been no established therapeutic alogrithms for the management of the spontaneous isolated splanchnic artery dissection. Conservative treatment is preserved for most patients with stable hemodynamics. In the condition of unstable hemodynamics, progression of dissection and signs of splanchnic ischemia, a surgical, interventional, or hybrid treatment is warranted.

AB To fully, define anesthesia hemodynamic effect due to use of dexmedetomidine in surgery for children with congenital heart disease. An in-depth retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 1230 cases (observation group) of congenital heart disease children with dexmedetomidine for anesthesia induction who received surgery from January 2014 to June 2015. The Main research parameters were specific indicator changes in diastolic pressure, systolic pressure, heart rate before and after anesthesia induction in children. The usage frequency of isoflurane among 1230 children was also recorded. To fully demonstrate the impact of dexmedetomidine on anesthesia hemodynamics, the researchers selected 1,000 cases (control group) of children with midazolam who underwent congenital heart surgery during the same period for comparative analysis, with the same parameters as those in the observation group. The study results show that after operative anesthesia, systolic pressure and heart rate of both groups of children decreased significantly; during surgical incision, heart rate, diastolic pressure, systolic pressure increases in the control group children were more obvious than those in the observation group; meanwhile, the observation group children received less isoflurane, With significantly lower frequency compared to the control group. The difference between the groups P <0.05 indicates statistical significance. Therefore, this study shows that during surgery of children with congenital heart disease, the anesthesia effect of dexmedetonzidine was relatively stable, and patient heniodynanzic status was stable. Its wide application imclinics is thus recommended.

AB Acute poisoning caused by consuming food, chemicals and pharmaceuticals is one of the main problems of public health, particularly in low and middle-income countries. Epidemiological studies related to various diseases have a key role in diagnosing the sources of contamination, transmission routes, prevalence and spread of various diseases (e.g. varied poisonings) and prevention and control approaches. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of acute poisonings caused by consuming food, chemical and pharmaceutical compounds at Imam Khomeini Hospital of Kermanshah during 4 years (2009-2012). We extracted the research data on food, chemical and pharmaceutical poisonings from Imam Khomeini Hospital of Kermanshah during this period of time using 165, 2610 and 3073 records of hospitalized patients in the hospital, respectively. After classifying the data regarding the objectives of the study, they were analyzed by using Excel and SPSS software. We used chi-square test to determine the association between the different variables and poisoning incidence. The results showed that most food, chemical and pharmaceutical poisonings had accrued in spring and summer. They recorded an increase in food poisoning incidence and a decrease in chemical and pharmaceutical poisonings from 2009 to 2012. The incidence of food and chemical poisonings was reported higher in men than in women, while gender differences in the incidence of drug poisoning were quite opposite. Among age groups, the highest incidence for each poisoning occurred in the age group of 30-15 years. Besides, the association between incidence of food, chemical and pharmaceutical poisonings and year, season, month, gender and age groups was significant (Pvalue<0.001). Therefore, responsible organizations need to take steps to train the public and broaden its knowledge of food hygiene and proper usage of chemicals and pharmaceuticals by employing different means (radio, television, newspapers, etc.), considering the significance of this association.

AB Background and aim: patient satisfaction is a significant indicator of the quality of provided care and services. The present study was an attempt to investigate the patient satisfaction with medical services provided by one of the hospitals in Kermanshah, Iran.
   Materials and methods: in this descriptive cross-sectional study, 406 inpatients were randomly selected and included in the study. The instrument for data collection comprised of a standard "patient satisfaction" questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and inferential statistics (independent t-test and ANOVA).
   Results: the mean score of the patients' total satisfaction with inpatient services was 3.49 out of 5. The maximum and minimum levels of satisfaction were reported for the domains of behavior of medical and administrative staff (3.65 +/- 0.96) and environmental hygiene of hospital (3.26 +/- 73.0). The patients' total satisfaction was different in terms of gender and age variables; however, it was not statistically significant in terms of education, career, residence, inpatient ward and reason of patient's referral.
   Conclusion: although the patients' total satisfaction with inpatient services was favorable, the patients were dissatisfied with hospital facilities. Hospital managers can proceed to increase the patient satisfaction with medical services by eliminating the factors causing dissatisfaction.

AB The present study was carried out in order to explain and predict academic stress based on academic procrastination among female students. The study method was correlational. The statistical population consisted of first grade female students of second high school in Kabudrahang in 2014-15. The sample size was estimated to be 210 individuals through Cochran formula. In so doing, multi-stage cluster sampling was employed. Data collection was carried out using Zajacova, Lynch and Espenshade academic stress questionnaire and Savari's procrastination survey. The results of Pearson correlation coefficient indicated that there is a direct significant relationship between female students' academic stress and the dimensions of intentional procrastination, procrastination caused by physical and mental fatigue, and procrastination caused by disorganization. The results of stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that in the second step, the dimensions of procrastination caused by mental and physical fatigue and also intentional procrastination can predict and explain 49% of changes in female students' academic stress. Therefore, it can be concluded that students' academic stress will decrease with a drop in their procrastination.

AB The anti phospholipids yndrome(APS) is a complex autoimmune disease that manifested by arterial and venous thrombosis, repeated abortion, and presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. History of miscarriage, aortic regurgitation, right atrialthrombosis, coronary artery disease, and post-operative chylous plural effusion is an exceedingly rare combination in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. We describe a case reportofa 35-year-old woman, admitted with a 10-year history of SLE with dyspnea, and typical chest pain. The patient had history of arthralgia, fatigue, and intermittent fever that treated by corticosteroids for the past three years. Subsequent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed the presence of a large mass in the right atrium that did not attach to tricuspid apparatus. TTEalso revealed severe aortic regurgitation. Screening laboratory evaluation for thrombophilia confirmed the diagnosis of secondary APS. The coronary angiography showed, sever three-vessel stenosis. Cardiac surgery with combined coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic valve replacement and right atrial clot resection were performed. The post-operative course was complicated withan exceptional complication of chylothorax which responded to a short period of corticosteroid therapy. Histological examination of clot demonstrated it to be composed entirely of fresh thrombus.

AB In order to thoroughly implement the and of people-oriented medical service, our hospital has adopted comprehensive intervention to replace traditional treatment and ntirsing Methods. In order to fully clarify specific changes in the use intensity of antimicrobial agents for spinal orthopedic disease after comprehensive intervention and improve rationality of use of antimicrobial agents, this study selected 2000: cases of patients admitted to the spinal orthopedics department as research subjects and grouped them based On whether they received comprehensive intervention. 1000 patients admitted from January 2013 to January 2014 didn't receive comprehensive intervention and were classified as the reference group; 1000 patients admitted from May 2014 to May 2016 had comprehensive intervention and were classified as the observation group. Use intensity of antimicrobial drug was calculated with defined daily dose (DDD) as the unit, drug use intensity of the two groups of patients, was judged and analyzed using SPSS19.0 statistical software. The results show that after comprehensive intervention, antimicrobial use density (AUD) of,spinal orthopedics patients decreased from the original 69 23 DDDs/100 people / day to 22.30 DDDs1100 person / day. The difference between the two groups was compared and there is a significant statistical difference. Therefore, the results of this study fully confirm the specific role of comprehensive intervention in improving the use intensity of antimicrobial agents. Implementation' of comprehensive fluffing methods can effectively reduce use intensity' of antimicrobial agents of spinal orthopedics patients, and thus improve the rationality of drug use in treatment.

AB Introduction: diabetic osteoporosis (DOP), due to the function impairment of bone marrow mesenchymal stein cells (BMMSCs), is commonly seen. The purpose of this study was to identify the different expressed microRNA (miRNA) in DOP BMMSCs.
   Materials and methods: In our study, we used diabetic rats as models to explore the role of miRNA in DOP BMMSCs. First, the osteoporosis conditions of diabetic rats were assessed, then their BMMSCs were cultured to make the experimental group. At the same time, BMMSCs taken from normal rats were cultured as the control group. In the final stage, differently expressed miRNA were singled out using deep sequencing technology.
   Results: The result showed that 8 weeks after the rats were induced to diabetes by streptozotocin (STZ) intraperitoneal injection, the density of their humerus was lower, their BV/TV (bone volume relative to tissue volume)was smaller and the trabecular spacing was greater than the wistar group. In addition, 10 pieces of miRNA were selected for their striking differences.
   Conclusion: By the significant enrichment information in pathway, the Notch signal pathway could regulate the diabetic osteoporosis BMMSCs. Our study has provided new ideas in terms of a further discussion of how miRNA works in DOP.
