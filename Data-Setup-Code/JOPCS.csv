In this study, the designed rotor is rotated by the rotating magnetic field of the secondary of the induction motor (IM). The magnetic bearing rotor has the function of the secondary side of the IM. In order to verify whether this instability affects the levitation characteristics by the pinning force, the horizontal angle of the rotor during the rotation is measured. At that time, the rotational characteristics are measured. Vibration suddenly occurred at a low rotational speed after the power supply started. After that, the rotor rotated stably. The inclination of the rotor is suppressed by 37.4% when the levitation gap g decreases. The pinning force increases as the levitation gap decreases. Therefore, the vibration suppressing effect of the rotor is obtained and the average angle is decreased. From the rotational experiments, it was confirmed the rotor with secondary of the IM function does not affect the levitation characteristics by the pinning force.","[Minamitani, Marin; Taniguchi, Rento; Ohashi, Shunsuke] Kansai Univ, Osaka 5648680, Japan","Minamitani, M (corresponding author), Kansai Univ, Osaka 5648680, Japan.",k242369@kansai-u.ac.jp; k129835@kansai-u.ac.jp; ohashi@kansai-u.ac.jp,,,,,,12,0,0,2,2,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1051-8223,1558-2515,,IEEE T APPL SUPERCON,IEEE Trans.

This can be attributed to their noninvasive advantages over traditional instrumentation approaches. Phase-based motion estimation (PME) and magnification (PMM) are targetless methods that have been utilized recently to extract qualitative data from structures via experimental modal analysis (EMA) and operational modal analysis (OMA). Transforming the motion-magnified sequence of images into quantified operating deflection shape (ODS) vectors is currently being conducted via edge detection. Although effective, these methods require human supervision and interference; such that, accurate characteristics of the structure are guaranteed. Within this study, a new hybrid computer vision approach is introduced to extract the quantified ODS vectors from motion-magnified images with minimal human supervision. The particle filter (PF) point tracking method is utilized to track the desired feature points in the motion-magnified sequence of images. Moreover, the k-means clustering method is employed as an unsupervised learning approach to perform the segmentation of the particles and assign them to specific feature points in the motion-magnified sequence of images. Total variation denoising is used to smooth the motion-magnified artifacts, which improves ODS vector extraction and provides a robust outlier removal. The results show that the cluster centers can be applied to estimate the ODS vectors, and the performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated experimentally on a lab-scale cantilever beam.","[Valente, Nicholas A.; Sarrafi, Aral; Mao, Zhu; Niezrecki, Christopher] Univ Massachusetts Lowell, Dept Mech Engn, Lowell, MA 01854 USA; [Mao, Zhu] Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Mech & Mat Engn, Worcester, MA 01609 USA","Mao, Z (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts Lowell, Dept Mech Engn, Lowell, MA 01854 USA.;Mao, Z (corresponding author), Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Mech & Mat Engn, Worcester, MA 01609 USA.",zmao2@wpi.edu,,"Valente, Nicholas/0000-0002-8178-5414",National Science Foundation [1762809],"Acknowledgements This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1762809.

This increases the complexity of developing a generalizable optimal control method that can be transferred to different buildings. Rather than hard-programming human knowledge into the controller (in terms of rules or models), a learning ability can be provided to the controller such that over the time it can learn by itself how to maintain an optimal operation in each specific building. This research proposes a model-free control framework based on Reinforcement Learning that takes into account the stochastic hot water use behavior of occupants, solar power generation, and weather conditions, and learns how to make a balance between the energy use, occupant comfort and water hygiene in a solar-assisted space heating and hot water production system. A stochastic-based offline training procedure is proposed to give a prior experience to the agent in a safe simulation environment, and further ensure occupants comfort and health when the algorithm starts online learning on the real house. To make a realistic assessment without interrupting the occupants, weather conditions and hot water use behavior are experimentally monitored in three case studies in different regions of Switzerland, and the collected data are used in simulations to evaluate the proposed control framework against two rule-based methods. Results indicate that the proposed framework could achieve an energy saving from 7% to 60%, mainly by adapting to solar power generation, without violating comfort or compromising the health of occupants.","[Heidari, Amirreza; Khovalyg, Dolaana] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Lab Integrated Comfort Engn ICE, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Heidari, Amirreza; Marechal, Francois] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Lab Ind Proc & Energy Syst Engn IPESE, CH-1951 Sion, Switzerland; [Heidari, Amirreza] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland","Heidari, A (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland.",amirreza.heidari@epfl.ch; francois.marechal@epfl.ch; dolaana.khovalyg@epfl.ch,"Khovalyg, Dolaana/W-8863-2018","Khovalyg, Dolaana/0000-0001-6064-2513",,,,59,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

State-of-the-art building energy simulations require information on the urban microclimate, but typically rely on ad-hoc numerical simulations, expensive in-situ measurements, or data from nearby weather stations. As such, they do not account for the full range of possible urban microclimate variability and findings cannot be generalized across urban morphologies. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study proposes two data-driven models to downscale climate variables from the meso to the micro scale in arbitrary urban morphologies, with a focus on extreme climate conditions. The models are based on a feedforward and a deep neural network (NN) architecture, and are trained using results from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of flow over a series of idealized but representative urban environments, spanning a realistic range of urban morphologies. Both models feature a relatively good agreement with corresponding CFD training data, with a coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.91 (R-2 = 0.89) and R-2 = 0.94 (R-2 & nbsp;= 0.92) for spatially-distributed wind magnitude and air temperature for the deep NN (feedforward NN). The models generalize well for unseen urban morphologies and mesoscale input data that are within the training bounds in the parameter space, with a R-2 = 0.74 (R2 = 0.69) and R-2 = 0.81 (R-2 = 0.74) for wind magnitude and air temperature for the deep NN (feedforward NN). The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed CFD-NN models makes them well suited for the design of climate-resilient buildings at the early design stage.","[Javanroodi, Kavan; Scartezzini, Jean-Louis] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Nik, Vahid M.] Lund Univ, Div Bldg Phys, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, Lund, Sweden; [Nik, Vahid M.] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Div Bldg Technol, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Giometto, Marco G.] Columbia Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Engn Mech, New York, NY 10027 USA","Javanroodi, K (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland.",kavan.javanroodi@epfl.ch; vahid.nik@byggtek.lth.se; mg3929@columbia.edu; jean-louis.scartezzini@epfl.ch,,,"joint programming initiative 'ERA-Net Smart Energy Systems' focus initiative on Integrated, Regional Energy Systems; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [775970]; SAFE project, BRIDGE programme by the Swiss Innovation Agency (Innosuisse) [187149]","This research work was supported by the joint programming initiative 'ERA-Net Smart Energy Systems' focus initiative on Integrated, Regional Energy Systems, with support from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [775970], and the SAFE project as part of the BRIDGE programme by the Swiss Innovation Agency (Innosuisse) [187149].",,111,1,1,11,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

This work develops thermodynamically-compatible water use effectiveness (WUE) and power usage effectiveness (PUE) ranges needed for direct and indirect water use analysis for 10 different DC archetypes in 15 U.S. climate zones, using a hybrid physical-statistical approach that is validated with real-world data. The ranges further capture variabilities between best and poor DC efficiency practices, showing that PUE and WUE values can have relative difference as much as 62% and 100% respectively, depending on cooling technologies, efficiencies, and locations. PUE results indicate significant climate effects, whereas WUE results indicate the strongest climate effects for airside economizers with either adiabatic or water-cooled chiller systems. Collectively, the results underscore the importance of considering technology, efficiency, and climate effects when estimating PUE and WUE for direct and indirect DC water use analysis. Results also identify variables leading to best-achievable PUE and WUE values by climate zone and cooling system type-including operational set points, use of free cooling, and cooling tower equipment and operational factors-which can support DC water- and energy-efficiency policy initiatives.","[Lei, Nuoa; Masanet, Eric] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Masanet, Eric] Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Evanston, IL USA; [Masanet, Eric] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Lei, N (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",nuoaLei2021@u.northwestern.edu,,,Leslie; Mac McQuown,The authors acknowledge financial support for NL provided by Leslie and Mac McQuown.,,77,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

These techniques have occupants giving subjective feedback using smartphones or smartwatches frequently over the course of days or weeks. The intention is that the data will be collected with high spatial and temporal diversity to best characterize a building and the occupant's preferences. But in reality, leaving the occupant to respond in an ad-hoc or fixed interval way creates unneeded survey fatigue and redundant data. This paper outlines a scenario-based (virtual experiment) method for optimizing data sampling using a smartwatch to achieve comparable accuracy in a personal thermal preference model with fewer data. This method uses BIM-extracted spatial data and Graph Neural Network-based (GNN) modeling to find regions of similar comfort preference to identify the best scenarios for triggering the occupant to give feedback. This method is compared to two baseline scenarios that use conventional zoning and a generic 4x4 square meter grid method from two field-based datasets. The results show that the proposed Build2Vec method has an 18%-23% higher overall sampling quality than the spaces-based and square-grid-based sampling methods. The Build2Vec method also performs similar to the baselines when removing redundant occupant feedback points but with better scalability potential.","[Abdelrahman, Mahmoud M.; Miller, Clayton] Natl Univ Singapore NUS, Coll Design & Engn, Dept Built Environm, Singapore, Singapore","Miller, C (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore NUS, Coll Design & Engn, Dept Built Environm, Singapore, Singapore.",clayton@nus.edus.sg,,,"Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) [R296000210114]; Internet of Buildings (IoB)Platform - Visual Analytics, Singapore [R296000214114]","Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) Tier 1 Grants provided support for the development and implementation of this research underthe projects Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) for Built Environ-ment Research (R296000210114) and The Internet of Buildings (IoB)Platform - Visual Analytics, Singapore for AI Technologies towards aWell and Green Built Environment (R296000214114).",,48,0,0,3,3,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

The results were as follows: Felicity ratio (FR) increased with increasing rotation angle, indicating that the memory of the original rock stress was affected by the rotation angle. Thus, the directional independence of the KE was directly related to the rotation angle. In theoretical calculations, the directional independence of the KE was directly related to the relative value of critical stress. The change in the relative value of the critical stress increased the difficulty of cracking, affecting the accuracy of the KE point. Poisson's ratio considerably affected the FR value, and the in situ stress values of the KE method on various types of rock samples differed.

Findings The study identified that air pollutants such as PM2.5 and PM10 as well as air-conditioned places, low ambient temperatures, poor ventilation and no views of the outdoor environment were deteriorating factors for COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, proper ventilation, the use of air cleaners, views of the outdoor environment and allowance for ample daylighting were improvement factors for COVID-19 patients. The inter-relationship of the various concepts was presented in an ontology chart. Practical implications As COVID-19 still exists and keeps evolving, this study provides suggestions to industry professionals, especially health-care Facility Managers, to create a post-pandemic environment focusing on the IEQ and finding long-term and reliable solutions for the well-being of occupants. Adaptability is crucial. New, creative technology solutions are being introduced daily, but it is up to the facility managers and health-care professionals to analyse and specify the most cost- and outcome-effective technologies for their facility. Originality/value The study brought to light the pivotal role of the indoor environment on the health and well-being of occupants, particularly in the contraction, spread, prevention and control of infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","[Afful, Aba Essanowa; Ayarkwa, Joshua; Acquah, Godwin Kojo Kumi] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Kumasi, Ghana; [Antwi, Ama Darkwah Darkwah Osci Assibey] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Land Econ, Kumasi, Ghana","Afful, AE (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Kumasi, Ghana.",trayafful5@gmail.com,,,,,,92,0,0,1,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0263-2772,1758-7131,,FACILITIES,Facilities,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1108/F-02-2022-0021,,18,Management,Business & Economics,1W3ZN,WOS:000806714600001,,,,,2022-07-14

A few WFPs have been proposed in the literature, but none has been able to properly account for the individual wakes within a grid cell or the effects of overlapping wakes from multiple turbines. A solution to these two issues is a WFP that includes both a wake model, which is a simplified analytical model of the wind speed (or wind power) deficit caused by a wake, and a wake superposition model, which accounts for overlapping wakes. Several such WFPs are developed here for the WRF model-based on the Jensen, the Geometric, and the Gaussian wake models coupled with two wake superposition methods (based on a squared deficit and a squared velocity superposition)-and tested individually, as well as combined together in an ensemble (EWFP), at two modern offshore wind farms. Most WFPs perform satisfactorily alone, but the EWFP generally outperforms them at both farms. The issue of resolved versus sub-grid wakes is explored for single- and multi-cell cases and for directions of alignment and non-alignment between the wind direction and the turbine columns. Although different combinations of wake loss and wake superposition models might be preferred at other wind farms, the general findings and detailed performance statistics given here might provide useful guidance in their selection.","[Ma, Yulong; Archer, Cristina L.] Univ Delaware, Ctr Res Wind CReW, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Vasel-Be-Hagh, Ahmad] Tennessee Technol Univ, Mech Engn Dept, Fluid Mech Res Lab, Cookeville, TN USA","Archer, CL (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Integrated Sci & Engn Lab ISELab, 221 Acad St, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",carcher@udel.edu,"Archer, Cristina/H-3105-2013","Archer, Cristina/0000-0002-7837-7575",U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) [0040420490],"U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), Grant/Award Number: 0040420490",,39,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1095-4244,1099-1824,,WIND ENERGY,Wind Energy,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/we.2758,,23,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Mechanical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,1T2SF,WOS:000804584400001,,,,,2022-07-14

In this article, a procedure to determine long-term fatigue damage and remaining life is presented as a combination of stochastic extrapolation of the 10 min DEL to determine its probability of exceedance and computationally fast synthesis of DELs using level crossings of a Gaussian process. Both the synthesis of DELs and long-term stochastic extrapolation are validated using measured loads from a wind farm. The extrapolation for the blade root flap and tower base fore-aft damage equivalent moment is presented using a three-parameter Weibull distribution, whereby the long-term damage equivalent load levels are forecast for both simulated and measured values. The damage equivalent load magnitude at a selected target probability of exceedance provides an indicator of the integrity of the structure for the next year. The extrapolated damage equivalent load over a year is validated using measured multi-year damage equivalent loads from a turbine in the Lillgrund wind farm, which is subject to wakes. The simulation of damage equivalent loads using the method of level crossings of a Gaussian process is shown to be able to reconstruct the damage equivalent load for both blade root and tower base moments. The prediction of the tower base fore-aft DEL is demonstrated to be feasible when using the Vanmarcke correction for very narrow band processes. The combined method of fast damage equivalent load computations and stochastic extrapolation to the next year allows a quick and accurate forecasting of structural integrity of operational wind turbines.","[Natarajan, Anand] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark","Natarajan, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",anand_nk@hotmail.com,"Natarajan, Anand/C-5517-2011","Natarajan, Anand/0000-0001-6850-0798",European Union [727680],"This research has been supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020 Societal Challenges - Secure, Clean and Efficient Energy, TotalControl Project (grant no. 727680).",,18,0,0,0,0,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2366-7443,2366-7451,,WIND ENERGY SCI,Wind Energy Sci.,JUN 2,2022.0,7.0,3,,,,,1171,1181,,10.5194/wes-7-1171-2022,,11,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1T3NH,WOS:000804639300001,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-07-14

The WCPM-NFB method has been further enhanced by modifying the control of the applied pulsed magnetic field. The aim was to adapt the control method to make use of the flux jump in a more efficient way while limiting the heat generation in the bulk. The target magnetic flux density of the PID controller was changed during the pulsed magnetization, allowing the applied magnetic field to be adapted consequently to the change of condition inside the bulk due to the flux jump.

Among all the household waste, plastic and paper are the most unmanaged waste that cause environmental issues. Several recycling associations in Malaysia have carried out their practices for better waste sustainability and management to curb the increasing amount of household waste. However, the effectiveness is still vague in achieving smart and effective household waste management. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate Malaysia's household waste management, mainly in three significant municipalities in Malaysia, namely Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and Melaka, in becoming a resilient and sustainable city by addressing two main research questions: (1) What are the key factors for ensuring the more successful moves for future household waste management in cities? and (2) How do each of the three municipalities of Malaysia cities address their waste issues based on the key factors from RQ1? This paper reviewed 13 waste management articles and explores the potential of the four factors of waste management from the perspective of technology and data, economy, social, and governance. The discussed factors and models contributed to an integrated future-proofing framework that focuses on smart waste tracking, a gamified awareness education, and strict policies to control waste management are the way forward for the future of smart cities household waste management.","[Cheng, Kin Meng; Tan, Jia Yue; Koo, Ah Choo; Sharji, Elyna Amir] Multimedia Univ, Fac Creat Multimedia, Cyberjaya 63100, Malaysia; [Wong, Shen Yuong] Xiamen Univ Malaysia, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Sepang 43900, Malaysia","Koo, AC (corresponding author), Multimedia Univ, Fac Creat Multimedia, Cyberjaya 63100, Malaysia.",1181400704@student.mmu.edu.my; 1161100234@student.mmu.edu.my; shenyuong.wong@xmu.edu.my; ackoo@mmu.edu.my; elyna.amir@mmu.edu.my,"Koo, Ah Choo/AAC-8106-2019","Koo, Ah Choo/0000-0002-1706-1796; Amir Sharji, Elyna/0000-0001-8683-6893",RIPHEN Joint Research Project Digital Futures [MMUE/200003]; Xiamen University Malaysia Research Fund [XMUMRF/2021-C8/IECE/0023],"This work was supported by RIPHEN Joint Research Project Digital Futures Grant-MMUE/200003, https://www.riphenmalaysia.net/ (accessed on 17 May 2022), 2021-2022.

An experiment is designed to further study the absorption of linearly polarized light by Cs-133 atoms. Theory and experiment show that the influence of linearly polarized light on the distribution of Cs-133 atoms will in turn affect the optical absorption.

For the abovementioned systems, predictions of the one-dimensional Wong formula remain substantially smaller than the sub-barrier fusion data. To address the fusion data, coupled channel calculations have been performed by using the code CCFULL. In the coupled channel calculations, the main effects of intrinsic degrees of freedom associated with the structure of the fusing pairs have been considered. For the O-16 + Sn-112,Sn-116,Sn-120 systems, the fusion enhancement can be traced back to couplings to inelastic excitations of 2+ and 3-vibrational states. However, for the O-18 + Sn-116 reaction, the sub-barrier fusion enhancements cannot be explained by couplings to vibrational degrees of freedom alone. In this case, couplings to two neutron (2n) transfer channels with positive Q-value are needed to reproduce the observed fusion enhancement. On the other hand, the SAGBD calculations remove the discrepancies between the cross section of the onedimensional Wong formula and the experimental results reasonably. Thus, the SAGBD-based results remarkably explain the fusion data of the studied reactions. In the SAGBD model, the large and non-zero values of lambda and V-CBRED for the chosen systems indicate that the nuclear structure of the fusing partners plays a very crucial role in the fusion dynamics of O-16 + Sn-112,Sn-116,Sn-120 reactions while positive Q-value neutron transfer channels and inelastic surface excitations of the collision partners collectively produce a more pronounced effect on the fusion of O-18 + Sn-116 reaction at sub-barrier energies.","[Ghanghas, Vijay; Chahal, Rishi Pal] Chaudhary Bansi Lal Univ, Dept Phys, Bhiwani 127021, Haryana, India; [Duhan, Sukhvinder] Set Jai Parkash Mukand Lal Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Appl Sci & Humanities, Yamunanagar 135133, Haryana, India; [Khatri, Hitender] Govt Coll Women, Dept Phys, Karnal 132114, Haryana, India; [Gautam, Manjeet Singh] Govt Coll Alewa, Dept Phys, Jind 126102, Haryana, India","Gautam, MS (corresponding author), Govt Coll Alewa, Dept Phys, Jind 126102, Haryana, India.",ghanghasvijay93@gmail.com; gautammanjeet@gmail.com,,,"CSIR, India [09/1307(0001)/2020-EMR-I]","One of the authors, Vijay, acknowledges receipt of the (senior research fellowship) fellowship from CSIR, India, under letter number: 09/1307(0001)/2020-EMR-I.",,73,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0103-9733,1678-4448,,BRAZ J PHYS,Braz.

In particular, critical thinking as one of the key competencies in Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) can stimulate imagination and creation. It is of great value to explore critical thinking cultivation in robot programming learning. Therefore, this study applied different teaching tools to take the content of making a manipulator through programming and construction in a robotics course as an experimental context to examine the promotion of learners' critical thinking. Before the experiment, a pre-test was conducted to measure students' critical thinking ability. Then, all students were divided randomly into two groups: one as an experimental group with the teaching tool of Construction-Criticism-Migration (CCM) instructional design, and the other as a control group with the traditional teaching tool of demonstrate-practice instructional design. After a 6-week experiment, the measurement of critical thinking was applied as a post-test. SPSS was used to conduct an independent sample t test and one-way ANOVA to explore whether students' critical thinking ability had improved and whether differences were found between the experimental group and the control group after the 6-week experiment. The results showed that the experimental group students' critical thinking ability significantly improved, whereas no significant difference was found before and after the experiment for the control group. A significant difference existed between the two groups. This study provides an example of a new instructional design teaching tool for the teaching of robot programming and can provide valuable suggestions for instructors in middle schools.","[Liu, Hehai] Anhui Normal Univ, Coll Educ Sci, Wuhu 241000, Peoples R China; [Sheng, Jie] Anhui Business Coll, Qual Assurance Dept, Wuhu 241000, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Li] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Educ Sci, Nanjing 210097, Peoples R China","Zhao, L (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Educ Sci, Nanjing 210097, Peoples R China.",liuhehai1997@163.com; s690634891@163.com; li.zhao@njnu.edu.cn,,"Zhao, Li/0000-0003-1000-1296",Higher Education Teaching Reform Research Project in Jiangsu [2021JSJG028],This study was supported by the Higher Education Teaching Reform Research Project in Jiangsu (No. 2021JSJG028).,,60,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2022.0,14.0,11,,,,,,,6625,10.3390/su14116625,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,1Z5GD,WOS:000808852000001,,gold,,,2022-07-14

We use a measured-peak grid tariff (MPGT) that puts a cost on the highest single-hour peak import over the month. We apply a mathematical model of a Home Energy Management System (HEMS) together with Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP), which calculates the long-term impact of operating as a non-linear expected future cost curve (EFCC) from the end of the scheduling period to the start. The proposed model is applied to a case study for a Norwegian building with smart control of a battery energy storage system (BESS), Electric vehicle (EV) charging and space heating (SH). Each of the flexible assets are investigated individually with MPGT and for an energy-based grid tariff. The results showed that EV charging has the highest peak-power impact in the system, decreasing the total electricity cost by 14.6% with MPGT when controllable compared to a reference case with passive charging. It is further shown how the EFCC helps achieve optimal timing and level of the peak demand, where it co-optimizes both real-time pricing and the MPGT.","[Thorvaldsen, Kasper Emil; Korpas, Magnus; Farahmand, Hossein] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Power Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway","Thorvaldsen, KE (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Power Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",kasper.e.thorvaldsen@ntnu.no,,,Research Council of Norway [257626/257660/E20],This work was funded and supported by the Research Council of Norway (Grant Number : 257626/257660/E20) and several partners through FME ZEN and FME CINELDI.

By taking advantages of polarization imaging techniques, these parameters enable a low-magnification and wide-field imaging system to separate the types of cells into more specific categories that previously were distinctive under high magnification. Instead of blindly choosing the model, the L0 regularization method is used to obtain the simplified and stable polarimetry feature parameter. We demonstrate the model viability by using the pathological tissues of breast cancer and liver cancer, in each of which there are two derived parameters that can characterize the cells and cancer cells respectively with satisfactory accuracy and sensitivity. The stability of the final model opens the possibility for physical interpretation and analysis.

Outdoor field measurements are conducted for brick, concrete, low-E glass, aluminium composite panel (ACP), and clear glass to observe the effect of morning solar exposure on the east-west facade surface temperatures. Two different types of insulation materials, namely newspaper and corn husk mat, are also manufactured and considered. Then, laboratory experiments are performed with 1 m x 1 m panel under two 1000 W halogen lamps by measuring air, surface and material temperatures using a thermocouples data-logger with a recording interval of 5 min and IR thermovision for visual confirming. The lamps simulate solar exposure during morning (8.00 a.m.-12.00 p.m.). It is noted that the brick wall stores heat during solar exposure, and then emits that heat to indoor and outdoor environments. Additional ACP to the brick wall reduces indoor air temperature significantly whereas direct impact on the outdoor temperature should also be accounted to avoid UHI. Besides, insulation material is found to be only beneficial during heating period in terms of reducing the indoor air temperature, however it slightly incremented the outdoor air temperature. This study shows how different facade systems of buildings significantly affect both the indoor and outdoor environments. It is revealed that, in the design process, the indoor air temperature should be considered for thermal comfort while the outdoor air temperature should be considered for UHI phenomenon.","[Wonorahardjo, Surjamanto; Andoni, Heri; Achsani, Rizky Amalia; Rahmah, Nadiya] ITB, SAPPK, Bldg Technol Res Grp, Jl Ganesha 10, Bandung 40132, Indonesia; [Sutjahja, Inge Magdalena; Thomas, Dixon] ITB, FMIPA, Phys Dept, Jl Ganesha 10, Bandung 40132, Indonesia; [Mardiyati, Y.; Steven, S.] FTMD, Mat Engn Dept, Jl Ganesha 10, Bandung 40132, Indonesia; [Tuncbilek, Ekrem; Arici, Muslum] Kocaeli Univ, Engn Fac, Mech Engn Dept, Umuttepe Campus, TR-41380 Kocaeli, Turkey; [Tedja, Suwardi] Univ Katolik Parahyangan, Dept Architecture, Bandung, Indonesia","Wonorahardjo, S (corresponding author), ITB, SAPPK, Bldg Technol Res Grp, Jl Ganesha 10, Bandung 40132, Indonesia.",titus@itb.ac.id,"Tunçbilek, Ekrem/AAG-6550-2021","Tunçbilek, Ekrem/0000-0001-6361-5633",Multidisciplinary Research Program [0109/I1],"This research and publication is financed by the Multidisciplinary Research Program, ITB 2019 with Number: 0109/I1.B04.1/PL/2019.",,85,0,0,6,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

The adherence to maintaining social distance has given an upsurge to the increased usage of mobile app users. This change in human interaction for fulling their basic to social to work needs through the intervention of app usage has led to privacy concerns by users. By keeping in view the changing dynamics of the way society works, this study is an endeavor to investigate gender differences of ad intrusive and privacy concerns on app usage behavior. Employing a quantitative research design, 371 respondents were surveyed using through an online structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed by using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results suggest that advertising intrusiveness and privacy concerns are significant in determining the consumer's attitude toward App usage, and a positive attitude toward App usage results in App usage behavior. However, gender's moderating role in attitude toward app usage and app usage behavior is insignificant for this study.

The machine learning model is supplied with training dataset to get trained with the dataset for conversion into the model and then tested with the test dataset for validating the model. The results of simulation are conducted on R-package over various libraries to predict the rooftop solar potential.

Offshore wind farm wakes can last several tens of kilometres downstream and thus affect the wind resources of a large area. So far, scale-specific models have been developed but it remains unclear how well the different model types can represent intra-farm wakes, farm-to-farm wakes as well as the wake recovery behind a farm. Thus, in the present analysis the simulation of a set of wind farm models of different complexity, fidelity, scale and computational costs are compared among each other and with SCADA data. In particular, two mesoscale wind farm parameterizations implemented in the mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF), the Explicit Wake Parameterization (EWP) and the Wind Farm Parameterization (FIT), two different high-resolution RANS simulations using PyWakeEllipSys equipped with an actuator disk model, and three rapid engineering wake models from the PyWake suite are selected. The models are applied to the Nysted and Rodsand II wind farms, which are located in the Fehmarn Belt in the Baltic Sea. Based on the performed simulations, we can conclude that both WRF + FIT (BIAS = 0.52 m s(-1)) and WRF + EWP (BIAS = 0.73 m s(-1)) compare well with wind farm affected mast measurements. Compared with the RANS simulations, baseline intra-farm variability, i.e. the wind speed deficit in between turbines, can be captured reasonably well with WRF + FIT using a resolution of 2 km, a typical resolution of mesoscale models for wind energy applications, while WRF + EWP underestimates wind speed deficits. However, both parameterizations can be used to estimate median wind resource reduction caused by an upstream farm. All considered engineering wake models from the PyWake suite simulate peak intra-farm wakes comparable to the high fidelity RANS simulations. However, they considerably underestimate the farm wake effect of an upstream farm although with different magnitudes. Overall, the higher computational costs of PyWakeEllipSys and WRF compared with those of PyWake pay off in terms of accuracy for situations when farm-to-farm wakes are important.","[Fischereit, Jana; Hansen, Kurt Schaldemose; Larsen, Xiaoli Guo; van der Laan, Maarten Paul; Rethore, Pierre-Elouan; Leon, Juan Pablo Murcia] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind & Energy Syst, Roskilde, Denmark","Fischereit, J (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind & Energy Syst, Roskilde, Denmark.",janf@dtu.dk,"; van der Laan, M.

Actuator line coupled to an aeroelastic solver enables not only the study of detailed wake dynamics but also aeroelastic loads, flexible blade deformation and how this interacts with the flow. Validating aeroelastic actuator line predictions of blade loading, deflection and turbine wakes in complex inflow scenarios is particularly relevant for modern turbine designs and wind farm studies involving realistic inflows, wind shear or yaw misalignment. This work first implements a vortex-based smearing correction in an aeroelastic coupled actuator line, and performs a grid resolution and smearing parameter study which demonstrates significant improvement in the blade loading and in the numerical dependencies of predicted thrust and power output. A validation is then performed using a 2.3 MW turbine with R = 40 m radius, comparing against blade resolved fluid-structure interaction simulations and full-scale measurement data, in both laminar and turbulent inflows including both high shear and high yaw misalignment. For an axisymmetric laminar inflow case, the agreement between blade resolved and actuator line simulations is excellent, with prediction of integrated quantities within 0.2%. In more complex flow cases, good agreement is seen in overall trends but the actuator line predicts lower blade loading and flapwise deflection, leading to underpredictions of thrust by between 5.3% and 8.4%. The discrepancies seen can be attributed to differences in wake flow, induction, the reliance of the actuator line on the provided airfoil data and the force application into the computational domain. Comparing the wake between coupled actuator line and blade resolved simulations for turbulent flow cases also shows good agreement in wake deficit and redirection, even under high yaw conditions. Overall, this work validates the implementation of the vortex-based smearing correction and demonstrates the ability of the actuator line to closely match blade loading and deflection predictions of blade resolved simulations in complex flows, at a significantly lower computational cost.","[Hodgson, Emily L.; Sorensen, Jens N.; Andersen, Soren J.] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Lyngby, Denmark; [Grinderslev, Christian; Meyer Forsting, Alexander R.; Troldborg, Niels; Sorensen, Niels N.] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Roskilde, Denmark","Hodgson, EL (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Lyngby, Denmark.",emlh@dtu.dk,"Andersen, Søren Juhl/I-7562-2019; Sorensen, Niels N./C-5516-2011; Sorensen, Jens Norkaer/Q-4525-2016; Meyer Forsting, Alexander Raul/V-6268-2018","Andersen, Søren Juhl/0000-0002-5935-751X; Grinderslev, Christian/0000-0003-3095-9733; Sorensen, Niels N./0000-0002-7185-7429; Sorensen, Jens Norkaer/0000-0002-1974-2675; Meyer Forsting, Alexander Raul/0000-0002-3133-1860; Hodgson, Emily Louise/0000-0001-6443-2628",,,,56,0,0,1,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-598X,,,FRONT ENERGY RES,Front.

In this activity,we build on prior literature and emphasize Three-Dimensional Learning (3DL) tosupport students in developing a deeper understanding of this complex problem. ThisOcean Acidification activity asks students to explain (1) the relationship between CO2concentration and ocean pH and (2) how and why changes in ocean pH could weakenshelled organisms. Among 136 students in a second-semester general chemistry courseat a large institution, 93% were able to correctly predict the relationship between CO2and pH (chemistry-biology connection). Additionally, 43% of the students were able tothen further apply this knowledge correctly to explain an unfamiliar situation in which the decreased pH could lead to less availablecarbonate ion for the shells (biological phenomenon). This result highlights that while some students were able to correctly explainthe biological phenomenon and make meaningful connections, others would require additional in-class scaffolding and student-instructor interaction to be able to integrate their knowledge to explain this unfamiliar complex biological phenomenon.

For this reason, a first Laboratory experiment with a fixed and controlled setup was followed by an Online 1 experiment, where the same participants took the same questionnaire (with a three weeks' time difference). Finally, the Online 2 experiment was used to broaden the sample background (results concerned the online method only). The setups mostly influenced the participants' responses by neutralising it (in 48% of the cases) while reporting a rate with an acceptable error (45% of Arate = 0/5 and 39% of Arate = 1/5). Wired headphones based rates agreed with the laboratory one consistently (36% of Arate = 0 and overall CV = 2-25% through soundscape descriptors). Wired earphones had a similar Arate percentage but with an overall more neutralised soundscape perception (overall CV = 1-40% compared with Laboratory rates). Wireless earphones caused the extremer Arate (54% of Arate = 3). Finally, natural and human noises are more detectable spontaneously, while traffic or other artificial noise are mostly recognised when directly addressed to the participants. This additional analysis gives more precise information about how efficient is the online method compared to the laboratory one. If accounted accordingly, an online-based soundscape questionnaire setup could also be viewed as a solid alternative to grasp a wider range of human perception points of view according to a broader cultural and geographical background.

Major die failures are related to surface damage due to heat checking cracks, wear, etc. Thereby, strengthening of the working surfaces of dies for hot bending, stamping, forging, and die casting processes is an urgent engineering challenge. Surface alloying with high-energy beams improves the properties of steel products. In these processes, the alloying powders and the treated surfaces can be remelted by electron beam within a short time while the bulk structure of the component remains unchanged, resulting in minimal distortion. The paper presents the results of the electron beam surface alloying (EBSA) of H21 and L6 tool steels with the treatment pastes containing boron carbide and aluminum powders. (2) Methods: Two types of pastes were used for surface alloying: a single-component (B4C) paste and a two-component (B4C+Al) one. The microstructure, microhardness, wear resistance, and elemental and phase composition of the layers obtained on steels were investigated. (3) Results: Four layers up to 0.4 mm thick were distinguished on the surface of the steels after the EBSA. Metallographic analysis showed coarse dendrite formation in the layers embedded in matrices of a eutectic or a solid solution. Microhardness of the steels after the two-component EBSA was higher than after B4C EBSA, which was related to a higher concentration of hard phases, such as iron borides and carbides. In addition, aluminum boride was revealed by the XRD analysis on L6 steel after B4C+Al EBSA. (4) Conclusions: Wear test indicated that the most resistant samples were H21 steel after single B4C EBSA and L6 steel after B4C+Al EBSA. Both samples contained carbon particles in the layer contributing to the high wear resistance as a lubricant. The conducted research is beneficial for mechanical engineering, automotive engineering, medical technology, aerospace engineering, and related industries, where coatings with high microhardness, wear resistance, and surface quality are demanded.","[Mishigdorzhiyn, Undrakh; Semenov, Aleksandr; Ulakhanov, Nikolay; Milonov, Aleksandr; Dasheev, Dorzho; Gulyashinov, Pavel] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Phys Mat Sci, Siberian Branch, Ulan Ude 670047, Russia; [Ulakhanov, Nikolay] East Siberia State Univ Technol & Management, Dept Mech Engn, Ulan Ude 670013, Russia; [Gulyashinov, Pavel] Russian Acad Sci, Baikal Inst Nat Management, Siberian Branch, 6 Sakhyanovoy St, Ulan Ude 670047, Russia","Ulakhanov, N (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Phys Mat Sci, Siberian Branch, Ulan Ude 670047, Russia.;Ulakhanov, N (corresponding author), East Siberia State Univ Technol & Management, Dept Mech Engn, Ulan Ude 670013, Russia.",mishigdorzh@gmail.com; semenov@ipms.bscnetru; nulahanov@mail.ru; terwer81@mail.ru; fokter@mail.ru; gulpasha@mail.ru,"Mishigdorzhiyn, Undrakh/J-1369-2016","Mishigdorzhiyn, Undrakh/0000-0002-7863-9045",Russian Science Foundation [19-79-10163],The study was carried out with a grant from the Russian Science Foundation (Project No. 19-79-10163).,,45,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4442,,LUBRICANTS,Lubricants,MAY,2022.0,10.0,5,,,,,,,90,10.3390/lubricants10050090,,17,"Engineering, Mechanical",Engineering,1Q5XJ,WOS:000802759500001,,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-07-14

Main outcomes included the lack of significant differences in dispositions towards critical thinking between Spanish and foreign students, alongside the existence of significant differences in academic motivation between both of these groups. In addition to this, significant differences were found within the group of Spanish nationality students in the dimensions of critical thinking as a function of intrinsic motivation, whilst such differences emerged in the foreign nationality group as a function of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and amotivation. Finally, within the group of Spanish students, a significant and positive relationship was found between motivation and critical thinking, being positive and non-significant in the foreign national group.

A reinforcement learning agent takes actions, which can be direct HVAC actuator commands or setpoints for control loops in building automation systems. The actions are taken to optimize one or more targets, such as indoor air quality, energy consumption and energy cost. The agent receives feedback from the HVAC systems to quantify how well these targets have been achieved. The feedback is captured by a reward function designed by the developer of the reinforcement learning agent. A few reviews have focused on the reward aspect of reinforcement learning applications for HVAC. However, there is a lack of reviews that assess how the actions of the reinforcement learning agent have been formulated, and how this impacts the possibilities to achieve various optimization targets in single zone or multi-zone buildings. The aim of this review is to identify the action formulations in the literature and to assess how the choice of formulation impacts the level of abstraction at which the HVAC systems are considered. Our methodology involves a search string in the Web of Science database and a list of selection criteria applied to each article in the search results. For each selected article, a three-tier categorization of the selected articles has been performed. Firstly, the applicability of the approach to buildings with one or more zones is considered. Secondly, the articles are categorized by the type of action taken by the agent, such as a binary, discrete or continuous action. Thirdly, the articles are categorized by the aspects of the indoor environment being controlled, namely temperature, humidity or air quality. The main result of the review is this three-tier categorization that reveals the community's emphasis on specific HVAC applications, as well as the readiness to interface the reinforcement learning solutions to HVAC systems. The article concludes with a discussion of trends in the field as well as challenges that require further research.","[Sierla, Seppo; Ihasalo, Heikki; Vyatkin, Valeriy] Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Elect Engn & Automat, FI-00076 Espoo, Finland; [Vyatkin, Valeriy] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci Elect & Space Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Vyatkin, Valeriy] ITMO Univ, Int Res Lab Comp Technol, St Petersburg 197101, Russia","Sierla, S (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Elect Engn & Automat, FI-00076 Espoo, Finland.",seppo.sierla@aalto.fi; heikki.ihasalo@aalto.fi; valeriy.vyatkin@aalto.fi,"Sierla, Seppo/E-8923-2012","Sierla, Seppo/0000-0002-0402-315X; Ihasalo, Heikki/0000-0002-8135-0859",Business Finland [7439/31/2018],This research was supported by Business Finland grant 7439/31/,,139,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,MAY,2022.0,15.0,10,,,,,,,3526,10.3390/en15103526,,25,Energy & Fuels,Energy & Fuels,1R5FA,WOS:000803393000001,,gold,,,2022-07-14

With this aim, the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III (GEPIII) Kaggle competition was launched in 2019. This effort was the largest building energy meter machine learning competition of its kind, with 4370 participants who submitted 39,403 predictions. The test dataset included two years of hourly whole building readings from 2380 meters in 1448 buildings at 16 locations. This paper analyzes the various sources and types of residual model error from an aggregation of the competition's top 50 solutions. This analysis reveals the limitations for machine learning using the standard model inputs of historical meter, weather, and basic building metadata. The errors are classified according to timeframe, behavior, magnitude, and incidence in single buildings or across a campus. The results show machine learning models have errors within a range of acceptability (RMSLEscaled = < 0.1) on 79.1% of the test data. Lower magnitude (in-range) model errors (0.1 < RMSLEscaled = < 0.3) occur in 16.1% of the test data. These errors could be remedied using innovative training data from onsite and Web-based sources. Higher magnitude (out-of-range) errors (RMSLEscaled > 0.3) occur in 4.8% of the test data and are unlikely to be accurately predicted.","[MILLER, C. L. A. Y. T. O. N.; PICCHETTI, B. I. A. N. C.

Design/methodology/approach The classic predict, observe and explain (POE) framework has been extended through the incorporation of an additional evaluate (E) phase into the model to enhance the self-regulated online learning environment. The extended POEE scaffolding approach, in this study, has been conceptualized as an implicit guide to support the process of guided inquiry for learning particular science concepts. Digital tools were sourced and integrated into this design framework to substitute for the support typically offered by teachers and peers in classrooms. Findings The findings suggest that the POEE pedagogical design facilitated the inquiry process through promoting self-regulation and engaged exploration. It also promoted positive emotions in students towards the scaffolded learning modules. Originality/value Integrating technologies that benefit students differentially in educational settings remains a considerable challenge. More specifically, in science education, an appropriate inquiry learning context that allows access to well informed pedagogical design is imperative. The application of this inquiry-based scaffolding framework can inform educators in the process of creating their own instructional designs and contexts to provide more effective guided learning.","[Al Mamun, Md Abdullah] Univ Queensland, Sch Educ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Al Mamun, MA (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Educ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",m.mamun@uqconnect.edu.au,,"Mamun, Md Abdullah Al/0000-0001-8490-5891","Australian Government Research Training Programme Scholarship at the University of Queensland, Australia","This research is funded by the Australian Government Research Training Programme Scholarship at the University of Queensland, Australia",,102,0,0,5,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1741-5659,1758-8510,,INTERACT TECHNOL SMA,Interact.

The production and systematic usage of solar fuels can reduce the use of fossil-based fuels, which are currently the primary source for the energy. It is time for us to exploit renewable sources for our energy needs to progress towards a low-carbon society. This can be achieved by utilizing green hydrogen as the future energy source. Solar light-assisted hydrogen evolution through photocatalytic water splitting is one of the most advanced approaches, but it is a non-spontaneous chemical process and restricted by a kinetically demanding oxidation evolution reaction. Sunlight is one of the essential sources for the photoreforming (PR) of biomass waste into solar fuels, or/and lucrative fine chemicals. Hydrogen production through photoreforming of biomass can be considered energy neutral as it requires only low energy to overcome the activation barrier and an alternate method for the water splitting reaction. Towards the perspective of sustainability and zero emission norms, hydrogen production from biomass-derived feedstocks is an affordable and efficient process. Widely used photocatalyst materials, such as metal oxides, sulphides and polymeric semiconductors, still possess challenges in terms of their performance and stability. Recently, a new class of materials has emerged as organic-inorganic hybrid (OIH) photocatalysts, which have the benefits of both components, with peculiar properties and outstanding energy conversion capability. This work examines the most recent progress in the photoreforming of biomass and its derivatives using OIHs as excellent catalysts for hydrogen evolution. The fundamental aspects of the PR mechanism and different methods of hydrogen production from biomass are discussed. Additionally, an interaction between both composite materials at the atomic level has been discussed in detail in the recent literature. Finally, the opportunities and future perspective for the synthesis and development of OIH catalysts are discussed briefly with regards to biomass photo-reforming.","[Augustin, Ashil; Shanmugam, Mariyappan; Sekar, Karthikeyan] SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Sustainable Energy & Environm Res Lab, Kattankulathur 603203, Tamil Nadu, India; [Chuaicham, Chitiphon; Vellaichamy, Balakumar; Sasaki, Keiko] Kyushu Univ, Dept Earth Resources Engn, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan; [Rajendran, Saravanan] Univ Tarapac prime, Fac Ingn, Dept Ingn Mecan, Avda Gen Velasquez, Arica 1775, Chile; [Hoang, Tuan K.

Findings Findings suggest that there are some changes in students' perception of classroom climate and their motivation to learn after the implementation of lesson study for learning community. Together with self-determination theory, lesson study for learning community may be viewed as a social and collaborative model as well as a supportive learning climate, promoting students' adaptive outcomes and needs satisfaction. Research limitations/implications Teachers need to be provided support to plan their lessons and to become familiar with the lesson study for learning community approach.

Since power performance tests are often carried out at sites consisting of several turbines in a row, the objective of this study is to evaluate whether the power performance of the five turbines differs from that of an isolated turbine. A number of simulations are performed, in which we vary the turbine inter-spacing (1.8, 2 and 3 rotor diameters) and the inflow angle between the incoming wind and the orthogonal line to the row (from 0 to 45 degrees). Different values of the free-stream velocity are considered to cover a broad wind speed range of the power curve. Numerical results show consistent power deviations for all five turbines when compared to the isolated case. The amplitude of these deviations depends on the location of the turbine within the row, the inflow angle, the inter-spacing and the power curve region of operation. We show that the power variations do not cancel out when averaging over a large inflow sector (from -45 to +45 degrees) and find an increase in the power output of up to +1 % when compared to the isolated case under idealised conditions (neutral atmospheric conditions, no vertical wind shear or ground effects). We simulate power performance measurements with both a virtual mast and nacelle-mounted lidar and find a combination of power output increase and upstream velocity reduction, which causes an increase of +4 % in the power coefficient under idealised conditions. We also use measurements from a real site consisting of a row of five wind turbines to validate the numerical results. From the analysis of the measurements, we also show that the power performance is impacted by the neighbouring turbines. Compared to when the inflow is perpendicular to the row, the power output varies by +1.8 % and -1.8 % when the turbine is the most downwind and upwind of the line, respectively.","[Sebastiani, Alessandro; Pena, Alfredo; Troldborg, Niels; Forsting, Alexander Meyer] DTU Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark","Sebastiani, A (corresponding author), DTU Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",aseb@dtu.dk,"; Meyer Forsting, Alexander Raul/V-6268-2018","Pena Diaz, Alfredo/0000-0002-7900-9651; Sebastiani, Alessandro/0000-0002-4351-9510; Meyer Forsting, Alexander Raul/0000-0002-3133-1860",European Union Horizon 2020 through the Innovation Training Network Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions: Lidar Knowledge Europe (LIKE) [858358],This work has received funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 through the Innovation Training Network Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions: Lidar Knowledge Europe (LIKE (grant no. 858358)).,,33,0,0,0,0,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2366-7443,2366-7451,,WIND ENERGY SCI,Wind Energy Sci.,APR 14,2022.0,7.0,2,,,,,875,886,,10.5194/wes-7-875-2022,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0M8NX,WOS:000782406300001,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2022-07-14

However, obtaining a comprehensive perspective on wind energy considering the many diverse factors that impact its development and growth is challenging. A significant factor in the evolution of wind energy is technological advancement and most previous reviews have focused on this topic. However, wind energy is influenced by a host of other factors, such as financial viability, environmental concerns, government incentives, and the impact of wind on the ecosystem. This review aims to fill a gap, providing a comprehensive review on the diverse factors impacting wind energy development and providing readers with a holistic panoramic, furnishing a clearer perspective on its future growth. Data for wind energy was evaluated by applying pivot data analytics and geographic information systems. The factors impacting wind energy growth and development are reviewed, providing an overview of how these factors have impacted wind maturity. The future of wind energy development is assessed considering its social acceptance, financial viability, government incentives, and the minimization of the unintended potential negative impacts of this technology. The review is able to conclude that wind energy may continue growing all over the world as long as all the factors critical to its development are addressed. Wind power growth will be supported by stakeholders' holistic considerations of all factors impacting this industry, as evaluated in this review.","[Haces-Fernandez, Francisco; Li, Hua] Texas A&M Univ, Coll Business Adm, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA; [Cruz-Mendoza, Mariee] Texas A&M Univ, Coll Engn, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA","Haces-Fernandez, F (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Coll Business Adm, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA.",francisco.hacesfernandez@tamuk.edu; mariee.cruz@students.tamuk.edu; hua.li@tamuk.edu,"; Haces-Fernandez, Francisco/R-4649-2017","Cruz Mendoza, Mariee/0000-0002-0326-690X; Haces-Fernandez, Francisco/0000-0001-8997-4095",Texas A&M University-Kingsville,The authors would like to acknowledge the support from Texas A&M University-Kingsville.,,201,0,0,5,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,APR,2022.0,15.0,7,,,,,,,2381,10.3390/en15072381,,25,Energy & Fuels,Energy & Fuels,0M2HY,WOS:000781982700001,,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-07-14

The most commonly used fracturing fluid is crosslinked guar gels. However, when using these systems, problems such as clogging of the pore space, cracking, and proppant packing with the remains of the undestroyed polymer arise. Therefore, the efficiency of the hydraulic fracturing process decreases. In this work, compositions based on viscoelastic surfactants (VES) and synthetic polymers (SP) were considered as alternatives capable of minimizing these disadvantages. Most often, the possibility of using a composition as a fracturing fluid is evaluated using rotational viscometry. However, rotational viscometry is not capable of fully assessing the structural and mechanical properties of fracturing fluid. This leads to a reduced spread of systems based on VES and SP. This paper proposes an integrated approach to assessing the effectiveness of a water-based fracturing fluid. The proposed comprehensive approach includes an assessment of the main characteristics of water-based fracturing fluids, including an analysis of their structural and mechanical properties, which is based on a combination of rotational and oscillatory rheology and a comparative analysis of methods for studying the influence of fluids on the reservoir rock. The use of the developed approach to assess the technological properties of fracturing fluids makes it possible to demonstrate the potential applicability of new, unconventional fracturing fluids such as systems based on VES and SP.","[Mihail, Silin; Lyubov, Magadova; Denis, Malkin; Polina, Krisanova; Sergei, Borodin; Andrey, Filatov] Gubkin Univ, Natl Univ Oil & Gas, Gubkin Univ Valuable Advice Theoret Mat & Assista, Dept Technol Chem Subst Oil & Gas Ind,Sci Ctr Int, Moscow 119991, Russia","Polina, K; Sergei, B (corresponding author), Gubkin Univ, Natl Univ Oil & Gas, Gubkin Univ Valuable Advice Theoret Mat & Assista, Dept Technol Chem Subst Oil & Gas Ind,Sci Ctr Int, Moscow 119991, Russia.",silin.m@gubkin.ru; magadova.l@gubkin.ru; malkindn@gmail.com; krisanova.p@gubkin.ru; borodin_2008@mail.ru; naru3434@mail.ru,,"Krisanova, Polina/0000-0002-0392-7341; Borodin, Sergei/0000-0001-6894-1446",Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation [075-15-2020-936],This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation under agreement No. 075-15-2020-936 dated 16 November 2020 within the framework of the development program for a world-class research center.,,77,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,APR,2022.0,15.0,8,,,,,,,2827,10.3390/en15082827,,19,Energy & Fuels,Energy & Fuels,0R3ZX,WOS:000785538500001,,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-07-14

This study aims to provide an evaluation framework for OGD for the AEC industry to assess the data utilization environment in order to improve the productivity of BIM-based projects. Several OGD principles found within related literature are discussed, and from them we extract evaluation framework levels. Then, we validate the proposed framework by applying it to a case of developing a BIM-based design support system using OGD datasets. This research concludes by suggesting that to effectively utilize OGD in the construction industry, the private sector should simply view data after collecting them, create an institutional environment for creating new values by reprocessing data, and build an active data utilization roadmap based on this environment.","[Park, Jong Jin; Kim, Eonyong; Jun, Han Jong] Hanyang Univ, Sch Architecture, Seoul 04763, South Korea","Jun, HJ (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Sch Architecture, Seoul 04763, South Korea.",johnny.jjpark@gmail.com; eonyong@gmail.com; hanjong@hanyang.ac.kr,"Gurmu, Argaw/AAR-7392-2020","Gurmu, Argaw/0000-0003-0750-4191","Architecture & Urban Development Research Program - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of the Korean government [21AUDP-B127891-05]","This research was supported by a grant (21AUDP-B127891-05) from the Architecture & Urban Development Research Program funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of the Korean government.",,103,0,0,7,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,APR,2022.0,12.0,4,,,,,,,490,10.3390/buildings12040490,,26,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,0U9AU,WOS:000787939500001,,gold,,,2022-07-14

The recovery of the optical properties of the imaged tissue from acoustic measurements achieved by optical inversion is essential for implementing quantitative EPAT (qEPAT). In this paper, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on deep gradient descent is developed for qEPAT. The network enables the reconstruction of images representing the spatially varying absorption coefficient in cross-sections of the tubular structures from limited measurement data. The forward operator reflecting the mapping from the absorption coefficient to the optical deposition due to pulsed irradiation is embedded into the network training. The network parameters are optimized layer by layer through the deep gradient descent mechanism using the numerically simulated data. The operation processes of the forward operator and its adjoint operator are separated from the network training. The trained network outputs an image representing the distribution of absorption coefficients by inputting an image that represents the optical deposition. The method has been tested with computer-generated phantoms mimicking coronary arterial vessels containing various tissue types. Results suggest that the structural similarity of the images reconstructed by our method is increased by about 10% in comparison with the non-learning method based on error minimization in the case of the same measuring view.

The application of various sources, which differ in the way in which they drive the interface into motion, and two surfactants with different rheological properties made it possible to generalize the results and to develop a unified approach to describing the problem. We show that the threshold occurrence of a two-zone flow structure with an axisymmetric flow nearby the source and stagnant zone at the periphery results from the competition between two counter-directed shear stresses caused by surfactant concentration inhomogeneity and source influence. We demonstrate that, regardless of the source type, the ratio of these stresses, known as the elasticity number, can be used to predict the formation of a two-zone flow and to define the position of the boundary between the zones. We examined in detail the conditions for formation of the multi-vortex flow within the stagnant zone. Although this phenomenon has been observed by many researchers, it has not yet met a consistent physical explanation. We hypothesized that the formation of vortices can be considered as the instability of the mechanical equilibrium of the surfactant layer caused by the shear on the side of the underlying bulk flow. Based on the mechanism suggested, we introduced a non-dimensional parameter, called the surface Rayleigh number, and estimated its critical value. Finally we analysed the conditions for the occurrence of this instability, called the shear-driven surfactant layer instability in some famous problems of interfacial hydrodynamics.","[Mizev, Aleksey; Shmyrov, Andrey; Shmyrova, Anastasia] RAS, Inst Continuous Media Mech, Ural Branch, Acad Koroleva St 1, Perm 614000, Russia","Mizev, A (corresponding author), RAS, Inst Continuous Media Mech, Ural Branch, Acad Koroleva St 1, Perm 614000, Russia.",alex_mizev@icmm.ru,"Shmyrova, Anastasia/Q-6600-2017; Mizev, Aleksey/U-6792-2018","Shmyrova, Anastasia/0000-0001-9199-2487; Mizev, Aleksey/0000-0001-5233-8271",Russian Science Foundation [19-71-00097]; Ministry of Science and High Education of Russia [121031700169-1],A.

However professional photography content is also needed for taking high-quality photos by mobile phones as ones taken by professional cameras. Existing learning tools for photography can't provide photographic practice while presenting theoretical content, nor give real-time photography guidance according to the environment. Mobile augmented reality (AR) technology provides a new way to solve these problems by creating a real learning situation. Therefore, an innovative AR-based mobile photography application (ARMPA) is designed and developed as a method to connect theory and practice. Based on Learning-by-Doing instructional strategy, the ARMPA can timely and synchronously display the theoretical content of photography in the form of text and images corresponding to learners' practical operation. Moreover, it can provide learners real-time interaction and guidance by using AR environment sensing technology. The effect of ARMPA on learning gain and cognitive load is assessed by traditional methods of pre/post-test and questionnaires. To objectively explore the effectiveness of ARMPA from a cognitive and emotional perspective, we measure and extract four emotional state indexes of electroencephalogram (EEG) including engagement (ENG), relaxation (MED), interest (INT) and focus (FOC).

The mathematical formulation of the dynamic problem for an elastic body is developed based on the variational principle of virtual displacements and the relations of linear elasticity theory. The behavior of an ideal compressible fluid is described by the potential theory, the equations of which together with boundary conditions are transformed to a weak form. The hydrodynamic pressure exerted by the fluid on the internal surface of the shell is calculated according to the linearized Bernoulli equation. The numerical implementation of the mathematical formulation has been done using the semi-analytical finite element method. The influence of the ply angle and lay-up configurations of laminated composites on the natural vibration frequencies and the hydroelastic stability boundary have been analyzed for shells with different geometrical dimensions and under different kinematic boundary conditions set at their edges. It has been found that the optimal value of the ply angle depends on the level of filling of the shell with a fluid. The obtained results support the view that by choosing the optimal configuration of the layered composite material it is possible to change upwards or downwards the frequency and mode shape, as well as the critical velocity for stability loss over a wide range.","[Bochkarev, Sergey A.; Lekomtsev, Sergey, V] Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch, Inst Continuous Media Mech, 1 Acad Korolev St, Perm 614068, Russia","Lekomtsev, SV (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch, Inst Continuous Media Mech, 1 Acad Korolev St, Perm 614068, Russia.",bochkarev@icmm.ru; lekomtsev@icmm.ru,"Bochkarev, Sergey/B-4844-2017","Bochkarev, Sergey/0000-0002-9722-1269", [19-119021490136-7],The study was made in the framework of the government order; state registration number of theme ????-?19-119021490136-7.,,54,0,0,0,0,TECHNO-PRESS,DAEJEON,"PO BOX 33, YUSEONG, DAEJEON 305-600, SOUTH KOREA",1225-4568,1598-6217,,STRUCT ENG MECH,Struct.

The granite rocks of north Um Taghir are connected to neoproterozoic rocks and integrated to the north Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS), which lies in Northeast Africa. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and X-ray fluorescence analysis, concurrent to some statistical analysis, have been carried for major oxides and some trace elements to extract much fundamental information by following certain mathematical methods. The exposed granite rock units in north Um Taghir are classified into four rock units represented by tonalite, granodiorite, monzogranite, and alkali-feldspar granite which are cut by different types of dikes. The magma of tonalite and granodiorite is low-to-medium K calc-alkaline affinity, while the magma of monzogranite and alkali-feldspar granite is medium-to-high K calc-alkaline affinity, and of metaluminous to peraluminous nature. Granite rocks show a slightly depletion of fractionated patterns from light rare earth elements (LREEs) to heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) with slightly positive to negative Eu anomalies from tonalite to monzogranite and alkali-feldspar granites. The statistical criteria have been achieved to explore the significant differences of radiological hazard parameters among samples. It is obvious that there is no homogeneity among samples; furthermore, in Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney test, and Pearson correlation coefficient, it can be noticed that there are significant differences between each pair of samples: tonalite, monzogranite; tonalite, alkali-feldspar granite; granodiorite, monzogranite; and granodiorite, alkali-feldspar granite. There is a strong direct relationship among granodiorite and both tonalite and alkali-feldspar granite, and among alkali-feldspar granite and tonalite and granodiorite. There is a strong inverse relationship among monzogranite and tonalite, granodiorite, and alkali-feldspar granite. As stated by all results, it can be mentioned that the granite rocks have a worthy result of mechanical and physical properties. So that they can be used for various economic purposes.","[Awad, Hamdy A.; Nastavkin, Aleksey, V] Southern Fed Univ, Inst Earth Sci, Zorge St 40, Rostov Na Donu 344090, Russia; [Awad, Hamdy A.; Tolba, Abdellah; Kamel, Mostafa; El-Wardany, Refaey M.] Al Azhar Univ, Fac Sci, Geol Dept, Assuit Branch, Assiut 71524, Egypt; [Ene, Antoaneta] Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Fac Sci & Environm, INPOLDE Res Ctr, Dept Chem Phys & Environm, 47 Domneasca St, Galati 800008, Romania; [Issa, Shams A.

This technique consists of an increase in the temperature field of the tumor to achieve coagulative necrosis and immediate cell death. Therefore, for having a successful treatment, the physical problem requires to know several properties due to the high variability from individual to individual, or even for the same individual under different physiological conditions. This article presents a numerical simulation of hyperthermia therapy for cancer treatment using HIFU, as well as the estimation of parameters that influence the physical problem. Two mathematical models were considered to solve the forward problem. The acoustic model based on acoustic pressure performs a frequency-domain study, and the bioheat transfer model a time-dependent study. These models were solved using Comsol Multiphysics (R) software in a 2D-axisymmetric rectangular domain to determine the temperature field. Parameter estimation was coded in Matlab Mathworks (R) environment using a Bayesian approach. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo method by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm was implemented, and the simulated temperature measurements were considered. Results suggest that specific HIFU therapy can be performed for each patient by estimating appropriate parameters for cancer treatment and provides the possibility to define procedures before and during the treatment.","[de los Rios Cardenas, Laura; Bermeo Varon, Leonardo A.] Univ Santiago Cali, Bioengn, Cali, Colombia; [de Albuquerque Pereira, Wagner Coelho] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Biomed Engn Program COPPE, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Varon, LAB (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Cali, Bioengn, Cali, Colombia.",leonardo.bermeo00@usc.edu.co,"Varon, Leonardo A Bermeo/D-4454-2015","Varon, Leonardo A Bermeo/0000-0002-8078-716X; De Los Rios Cardenas, Laura/0000-0003-1207-4157","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico; Direccion General de Investigaciones Universidad Santiago de Cali [819-621120-1767, 6-2019]; Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; CAPES","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnol~ogico; Direcci~on General de Investigaciones Universidad Santiago de Cali, Grant/Award Numbers: 819-621120-1767, 6-2019; Fundac~ao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; CAPES",,77,0,0,10,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-7939,2040-7947,,INT J NUMER METH BIO,Int.

These dikes are classified into two subphases: (1) acidic dikes (porphyritic dacite, microgranite, granophyre, and alkaline granophyre dikes); and (2) basic dikes (basalt and dolerite dikes). They range from vertical or steeply inclined bodies, 0.5-15 m wide, pink to black color, and NE-SW to N-S directions. Acidic dikes with different mineralogical constituents have medium to high k-characters, originating from calc-alkaline magma and extruded in a volcanic arc environment. In contrast, basic dikes have medium k-characters, originating from tholeiitic magma and developing within a plate environment. Basic dikes are enriched with opaque minerals, where the basaltic dike contains iron oxides (magnetite and hematite), such as apatite in addition to copper minerals. Dolerite dike comprises magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pyrite.","[Awad, Hamdy A.] Southern Fed Univ, Inst Earth Sci, 40 Zorge St, Rostov Na Donu 344090, Russia; [Awad, Hamdy A.] Al Azhar Univ, Fac Sci, Geol Dept, Assuit Branch, Assiut 71524, Egypt; [Tekin, Huseyin Ozan m] Univ Sharjah, Coll Hlth Sci, Dept Med Diagnost Imaging, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates; [Tekin, Huseyin Ozan m] Istinye Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Comp Engn Dept, TR-34396 Istanbul, Turkey; [Kamar, Mohamed S.; El-Aassy, Ibrahim E.; El-Sayed, Abdu A.] Nucl Mat Author, POB 530 El Maadi, Cairo, Egypt; [Salem, Ibrahim A.] Tanta Univ, Fac Sci, Geol Dept, Tanta, Egypt; [Alzahrai, Abdullah M.] Taif Univ, Engn Coll, Dept Civil Engn, POB 11099, At Taif 21944, Saudi Arabia; [Lasheen, El Saeed R.] Al Azhar Univ, Fac Sci, Geol Dept, POB 11884, Cairo, Egypt","Awad, HA (corresponding author), Southern Fed Univ, Inst Earth Sci, 40 Zorge St, Rostov Na Donu 344090, Russia.;Awad, HA (corresponding author), Al Azhar Univ, Fac Sci, Geol Dept, Assuit Branch, Assiut 71524, Egypt.;Tekin, MHO (corresponding author), Univ Sharjah, Coll Hlth Sci, Dept Med Diagnost Imaging, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates.;Tekin, MHO (corresponding author), Istinye Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Comp Engn Dept, TR-34396 Istanbul, Turkey.",drkamar30@gmail.com; dr_ibr_salm@yahoo.com; Ibrahimelaasy4@gmail.com; Geologyabd6852@gmail.com; hamdiawaad@gmail.com; tekin765@gmail.com; amyalzahrni@tu.edu.sa; elsaeedlasheen@azhar.edu.eg,"Tekin, Huseyin Ozan/J-9611-2016","Tekin, Huseyin Ozan/0000-0002-0997-3488; Lasheen, El Saeed/0000-0002-7931-5421",Joint Executive Program between Egypt and Russian Federation,Hamdy A.

Enhanced electrical properties of TiO2 are ensured, especially by a careful selection of the bottom electrode material. Iridium dioxide (IrO2) is an excellent choice, as it favors the high-k rutile phase growth of TiO2. In this study, we introduce the fabrication of IrO2/TiO2/IrO2 capacitors and thoroughly characterize their electrical behavior. These capacitors show a dielectric constant for low temperature sputtered TiO2 of similar to 70. From leakage current measurements, a coupled capacitive-memristive behavior is determined, which is assumed due to the presence of a reduced TiO2-x layer at the IrO2/TiO2 interface observed from transmission electron microscopy analyses. The memristive effect most probably originates from trapping and detrapping of electric charges in oxygen vacancy defects, which themselves can be generated and annihilated through an applied electric field, subsequently changing the resistance of the capacitor. The electric degradation type is identified as a filament-forming mechanism. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the leakage current is measured, demonstrating that the temperature behavior is strongly influenced by the ambient atmosphere. The latter dependency leads to the hypothesis that the oxygen evolution reaction of water incorporated in the IrO2/TiO2 interface passivates vacancies, thus significantly impacting the vacancy density in TiO2 and, as a further consequence, the electrical performance.

When many users are connected to the grid, high-performance forecasting models are required, posing several problems associated with the availability of historical energy consumption data for each end-user and training, deploying and maintaining a model for each user. Moreover, introducing new end-users to an existing network poses problems relating to their forecasting model. Global models, trained on all available data, are emerging as the best solution in several contexts, because they show higher generalization performance, being able to leverage the patterns that are similar across different time series. In this work, the lodging/residential electricity 1-h-ahead load forecasting of multiple time series for smart grid applications is addressed using global models, suggesting the effectiveness of such an approach also in the energy context. Results obtained on a subset of the Great Energy Predictor III dataset with several global models are compared to results obtained with local models based on the same methods, showing that global models can perform similarly to the local ones, while presenting simpler deployment and maintainability. In this work, the forecasting of a new time series, representing a new end-user introduced in the pre-existing network, is also approached under specific assumptions, by using a global model trained using data related to the existing end-users.

The common approach for energy demand estimation is using only typical meso-scale weather data in building energy models (BEMs), which underestimates the impacts of extreme climate and microclimate variations. To quantify the impacts of such underestimation on assessing the future energy performance of buildings, this study simulates a high spatiotemporal resolution BEM for two representative residential buildings located in a 600 x 600 m2 urban area in Southeast Sweden while accounting for both climate change and microclimate. Future climate data are synthesized using 13 future climate scenarios over 2010-2099, divided into three 30-year periods, and microclimate data are generated considering the urban morphology of the area. It is revealed that microclimate can cause 17% rise in cooling degree-day (CDD) and 7% reduction in heating degree-day (HDD) on average compared to mesoclimate. Considering typical weather conditions, CDD increases by 45% and HDD decreases by 8% from one 30-year period to another. Differences can become much larger during extreme weather conditions. For example, CDD can increase by 500% in an extreme warm July compared to a typical one. Results also indicate that annual cooling demand becomes four and five times bigger than 2010-2039 in 2040-2069 and 2070-2099, respectively. The daily peak cooling load can increase up to 25% in an extreme warm day when accounting for microclimate. In the absence of cooling systems during extreme warm days, the indoor temperature stays above 26 degrees C continuously over a week and reaches above 29.2 degrees C.

It measures air temperature, humidity, globe temperature, brightness temperature, light intensity, and wind, and is capable of calculating thermal indices (e.g., physiologically equivalent temperature (PET)) on site. It visualizes its data on an integrated display and sends them continuously to a server, where web-based visualizations are available in real-time. Data from many MoBiMets deployed in real occupational settings were used to demonstrate their suitability for large-scale and continued monitoring of thermal comfort in various contexts (industrial, commercial, offices, agricultural). This article describes the design and the performance of the MoBiMet. Alternative methods to determine mean radiant temperature (T-mrt) using a light intensity sensor and a contactless infrared thermopile were tested next to a custom-made black globe thermometer. Performance was assessed by comparing the MoBiMet to an independent mid-cost thermal comfort sensor. It was demonstrated that networked MoBiMets can detect differences of thermal comfort at different workplaces within the same building, and between workplaces in different companies in the same city. The MoBiMets can capture spatial and temporal differences of thermal comfort over the diurnal cycle, as demonstrated in offices with different stories and with different solar irradiances in a single high-rise building. The strongest sustained heat stress was recorded at industrial workplaces with heavy machinery.","[Sulzer, Markus; Christen, Andreas; Matzarakis, Andreas] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Chair Environm Meteorol, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany; [Matzarakis, Andreas] German Meteorol Serv, Res Ctr Human Biometeorol, Stefan Meier Str 4, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany","Sulzer, M (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Chair Environm Meteorol, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",markus.sulzer@meteo.uni-freiburg.de; andreas.christen@meteo.uni-freiburg.de; andreas.matzarakis@dwd.de,"Christen, Andreas/I-6037-2012; Matzarakis, Andreas/AAO-2676-2021","Christen, Andreas/0000-0003-3864-1703; Matzarakis, Andreas/0000-0003-3076-555X; Sulzer, Markus/0000-0001-5588-2985",,,,72,1,1,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,MAR,2022.0,22.0,5,,,,,,,1828,10.3390/s22051828,,25,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,ZS5WH,WOS:000768535800001,35270974.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-07-14

However, the existing research has tended to overlook the Comprehensive nature of scientific higher-order thinking (S-HOT) and stopped short of defining its unique features. In response, this study presents a novel model for S-HOT that synthesises five competencies. To confirm the structure of SHOT, the study developed a new questionnaire to measure students' S-HOT. The study's participants included 1,153 students from 15 junior high schools in China. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the developed S-HOT survey had satisfactory validity and reliability. Structural equation modelling was used to confirm the cause-and-effect relationships between creative thinking, critical thinking, metacognition, science self-efficacy, and scientific reasoning in the S-HOT structure. The results showed that the average score of male students was significantly higher than that of female students in creative thinking. It was also revealed that there was a correlation between the five competencies: metacognition had a significant path to scientific reasoning, science self-efficacy had a significant path to critical and creative thinking, and scientific reasoning directly affected science self-efficacy.","[Sun, He; Xie, Yueguang] Northeast Normal Univ, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, JingYue Ave, Changchun 130117, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Lavonen, Jari] Univ Helsinki, Fac Educ Sci, Helsinki, Finland","Xie, YG (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, JingYue Ave, Changchun 130117, Jilin, Peoples R China.",xyg6367@126.com,,"Lavonen, Jari/0000-0003-2781-7953",National Social Science Fund of China [BCA190074],"Fundings The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is supported by The National Social Science Fund of China under grant number BCA190074",,92,0,0,5,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1871-1871,1878-0423,,THINK SKILLS CREAT,Think.

Signal waveforms of a magnetized metallic piece passing through a trench located below the superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) were measured. We found that the waveform depended on the direction of the magnetic dipole at the time of detection and could be roughly divided into six categories to explain all the experimental results. The maximum magnitude obtained for each sample was plotted against the equivalent spherical diameter of the sample.

The optimal electrical designs of the three types of 10 MW wind turbine generators are then created based on the developed design program. Second, the influences of the rated revolution on the basic performance parameters of the HTS generator are investigated, and the results are compared with those of the other two types of generators. It is found that the generator weight decreases with the increases of the rated revolution and the stator outer diameter, and the optimal rated revolution for a generator with a large stator outer diameter is determined to be 40 min(-1).

The quality of abundance estimation depends on the number of materials, size, the geometrical orientation of materials, the source of endmembers, and the inversion algorithm used. However, there is a lack of studies on one-to-one assessment of the retrieval of abundances under various scenarios of spectral material distributions, the spatial resolution of the imagery, and the potential of in-situ reflectance measurements as candidate endmembers. The unavailability of comprehensive benchmark data coupled with pixel-to-pixel ground truth data has impeded comprehensive assessment of the first principles of spectral unmixing from a verifiable experimental perspective. The objective of this research is assessing the dynamics of material abundance as a function of the source of endmembers, spatial resolution, number of materials, and the size of materials. Linear and its sparse-based spectral unmixing algorithms were implemented on the datasets acquired for the estimation of abundances, considering the different scenarios of material distributions, spatial resolution, and the source of endmembers. We validated the results using pixel-to-pixel ground truth maps prepared for the different cases of spectral unmixing. The results provide answers to some critical open challenges in spectral unmixing, such as, (i) for an unambiguous detection, the fractional distribution of material has to be at least 1% of the pixel, (ii) endmembers from the in-situ spectra based on the external spectral library can offer reasonably good abundance estimates (an error of up to 20% compared to the image-based endmembers), and (iii) geometric orientations of materials in the ground sampling distance influence the abundance estimations. The benchmark dataset generated in this work is a valuable resource for addressing intriguing questions in spectral unmixing using hyperspectral imagery from a multi-resolution perspective.","[Kumar, C.

Wake steering is one such method that provides control-based improvements in a quasi-static way, but this does little to fundamentally change the wake recovery process, and thus, it has limited potential. This study investigates use of another control paradigm known as dynamic wake control (DWC) to excite the mutual inductance instability between adjacent tip-vortex structures, thereby accelerating the breakdown of the structures. The current work carries this approach beyond the hypothetical by applying the excitation via turbine control vectors that already exist on all modern wind turbines: blade pitch and rotor speed control. The investigation leverages a free-vortex wake method (FVWM) that allows a thorough exploration of relevant frequencies and amplitudes of harmonic forcing for each control vector (as well as the phase difference between the vectors for a tandem configuration) while still capturing the essential tip-vortex dynamics. The FVWM output feeds into a Fourier stability analysis working to pinpoint candidate DWC strategies suggesting fastest wake recovery. Near-wake length reductions of > 80% are demonstrated, although without considering inflow turbulence. Analysis is provided to interpret these predictions considering the presence of turbulence in a real atmospheric inflow.","[Brown, Kenneth; Houck, Daniel; Maniaci, David; Westergaard, Carsten; Kelley, Christopher] Sandia Natl Labs, Wind Energy Technol Dept, Albuquerque, NM 87123 USA","Brown, K (corresponding author), Sandia Natl Labs, Wind Energy Technol Dept, Albuquerque, NM 87123 USA.",kbrown1@sandia.gov; drhouck@sandia.gov; dcmania@sandia.gov; cw@westergaardsolutions.com; clkell@sandia.gov,,,Wind Energy Technologies Office of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE); U.S. DOE [DE-NA-0003525],"The Wind Energy Technologies Office of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is gratefully acknowledged for their funding support.

The largest azimuth rotation per unit thickness is achieved in PAZO (33 degrees/mu m) and P1-2 (25 degrees/mu m).

This is particularly important for floating wind turbines, having natural frequencies in a frequency range where the wind loads are high and large turbulent structures exist. This study shows that turbulence modelling greatly impacts the response of a 15-MW floating wind turbine. The turbulence models recommended by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) are challenged by considering two additional models: Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and an approach using input from offshore wind measurements (TIMESR). The two standard models, the Kaimal spectrum with IEC coherence model (Kaimal) and the Mann spectral tensor model (Mann), differ in their coherence formulation. This results in higher standard deviations for the surge and pitch motions, and lower for the yaw motion, when applying Kaimal in comparison to Mann. For the specific floater of this study, more damage is obtained in the mooring lines when applying Kaimal. Applying the more realistic models, LES and TIMESR, increases the range of response further, concluding that the two standard turbulence models may lead to incorrect estimations of the response of a floating wind turbine. LES and TIMESR take atmospheric stability into account, which is proven to alter the response significantly.","[Nybo, Astrid; Gunnar Nielsen, Finn; Godvik, Marte] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Allegaten 70, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Nybo, Astrid; Gunnar Nielsen, Finn; Godvik, Marte] Univ Bergen, Bergen Offshore Wind Ctr BOW, Allegaten 70, N-5007 Bergen, Norway; [Godvik, Marte] Equinor, Stavanger, Norway","Nybo, A (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Allegaten 70, N-5007 Bergen, Norway.;Nybo, A (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Bergen Offshore Wind Ctr BOW, Allegaten 70, N-5007 Bergen, Norway.",astrid.nybo@uib.no,,"Nybo, Astrid/0000-0002-7438-7936",Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy,"The authors would like to thank Vegard Milde, an MSc student at the University of Bergen, for cooperation on the OpenFAST model of the spar floater.

This research used an embedded mixed-method design. The subjects selected were 28 out of 98 seventh graders at a boys' junior high school in Bangkok, Thailand, who were chosen by cluster random sampling technique. The instruments, which were validated by five experts, included a questionnaire, lesson plans, exit tickets, interview protocols, and tests of critical thinking skills in polynomials. The content validity was assessed via expert judgment, and reliability was assessed by item analysis. The quality and effectiveness of the instruments were acceptable. The research results showed the following: (1) most students at all performance levels prefer activities in which they can learn from participating in classroom activities, such as games, activities with real-life applications, and activities involving listening instead of reading and writing, and (2) critical thinking skills in high-achieving and fair-achieving students were at the fair level, while those of low-achieving students were poor. Analysis was the highest critical thinking subskill among high-achieving and low-achieving students, while interpretation was the highest subskill in among fair-achieving students. Open-ended questions and activities based on students' preferences appear to be practical for developing critical thinking skills among students of all achievement levels.","[Monrat, Natthanon; Phaksunchai, Mingkhuan; Chonchaiya, Ratchanikorn] King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Fac Sci, 126 Pracha Uthit Rd, Bangkok 10140, Thailand","Phaksunchai, M (corresponding author), King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Fac Sci, 126 Pracha Uthit Rd, Bangkok 10140, Thailand.",natthanon.mon@mail.kmutt.ac.th; mingkhuan.pha@mail.kmutt.ac.th; ratchanikorn.cho@mail.kmutt.ac.th,,,Petchra Pra Jom Klao Masters Degree Research Scholarship from King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi [10/2562],The authors would like to express their great appreciation to Mr. Nandana Indananda for the facilities that supported this research.

We review some of the limitations of top-down wind-farm models, partly in light of basic atmospheric boundary-layer findings which have been coined by the late Sergej Zilitinkevich. Essentially, for the applicability of such analytical models, the wind-farm turbine hub height should be small compared to the atmospheric boundary-layer height, and very small compared to the horizontal extension of the farm and the distance to the nearest surface inhomogeneities.

New model features can improve the ability of a machine learning model to classify a person's thermal preference. The spatial context of a building can provide information to models about the windows, walls, heating and cooling sources, air diffusers, and other factors that create micro-environments that influence thermal comfort. Due to spatial heterogeneity, it is impractical to position sensors at a high enough resolution to capture all conditions. This research aims to build upon an existing vector-based spatial model, called Build2Vec, for predicting spatial-temporal occupants' indoor environmental preferences. Build2Vec utilizes the spatial data from the Building Information Model (BIM) and indoor localization in a real-world setting. This framework uses longitudinal intensive thermal comfort subjective feedback from smart watch-based ecological momentary assessments (EMA). The aggregation of these data is combined into a graph network structure (i.e., objects and relations) and used as input for a classification model to predict occupant thermal preference. The results of a test implementation show 14%-28% accuracy improvement over a set of baselines that use conventional thermal preference prediction input variables.","[Abdelrahman, Mahmoud M.; Chong, Adrian; Miller, Clayton] Natl Univ Singapore NUS, Dept Built Environm, Singapore, Singapore","Miller, C (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore NUS, Dept Built Environm, Singapore, Singapore.",clayton@nus.edu.sg,"Miller, Clayton/I-8813-2019","Miller, Clayton/0000-0002-1186-4299; AbdelRahman, Mahmoud Mohamed/0000-0001-8027-6936","Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) [R296000210114, R296000214114]",Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) Tier 1 Grants provided support for the development and implementation of this research under the projects: Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) for Built En-vironment Research (R296000210114) and The Internet-of-Buildings (IoB) Platform - Visual Analytics for AI Technologies towards a Well and Green Built Environment (R296000214114) .,,57,3,3,2,2,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-1323,1873-684X,,BUILD ENVIRON,Build.

Conventional methods of the in-situ stress measurement are time- and cost-intensive. Therefore, the application of low-cost yet rapid methodologies for in-situ stress evaluation has been increasingly regarded by researchers. The Kaiser effect-based acoustic emission method is one of such novel approaches to the in-situ stress evaluation. Not only the point at which the Kaiser effect occurs, but also the mechanism of the Kaiser effect is of paramount importance. In this research, acoustic emission tests were conducted on phyllite rock samples under Brazilian tensile loading to collect a variety of acoustic data, including the amplitude, rise time, count, duration, and energy. Then, the Kaiser effect point was determined using the collected data on acoustic parameters, with its occurrence mechanism investigated. In addition, mathematical transformations were adopted to transform the acoustic signal from the time domain to the frequency domain, where the peak frequency was analyzed. The results of the RA/AF ratio analysis showed that the acoustic emission was sourced from tensile micro-cracks. Moreover, the high level of energy indicated a high intensity of crack formation at the Kaiser effect point. The large number of received hits showed that the count of generated cracks increases abruptly within the range of the Kaiser effect. In addition, the obtained high value of the peak frequency implied that the crack growth rate is high at the Kaiser effect point.","[Dinmohammadpour, Mohammadmahdi] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Min Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Nikkhah, Majid] Shahrood Univ Technol, Fac Min Petr & Geophys Engn, Shahrood, Iran; [Goshtasbi, Kamran] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Min Engn Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Ahangari, Kaveh] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Min Engn, Tehran, Iran","Nikkhah, M (corresponding author), Shahrood Univ Technol, Fac Min Petr & Geophys Engn, Shahrood, Iran.",m.nikkhah@shahroodut.ac.ir,,,,,,52,0,0,1,1,"UNIV ZAGREB, FAC MINING, GEOLOGY & PETROLEUM ENGINEERING",ZAGREB,"PIEROTTIJEVA 6, ZAGREB, 10000, CROATIA",0353-4529,1849-0409,,RUD-GEOL-NAFT ZB,Rud.-Geol.-Naft.

The purpose of this meta-analysis is to ascertain the overall effect of RME and to examine the moderator variables in order to explore the consequences.

The study examined 54 effect sizes from 38 individual studies conducted in the past two decades, involving 6140 participants. The estimation procedure was according to the random effects model, and statistical calculations were performed using the CMA program. According to the research findings, the study's overall effect size was 0.97. This suggests that implementing RME has a significant favourable influence on pupils' mathematical abilities. Moderator variables analysis shows that RME implementation would be more efficient when considering sample size, intervention length, learning mix, and education level. This finding contributes to the future implementation of RME to consider those variables that are shown to moderate the studies' effect sizes. Finally, comparisons of RME across countries and limitations of the study are discussed, providing vital information as a starting point for later studies and development of RME.","[Juandi, Dadang; Kusumah, Yaya Sukjaya] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Kota Bandung, Indonesia; [Tamur, Maximus] Univ Katolik Indonesia Santu Paulus Ruteng, Kabupaten Manggarai, Indonesia","Juandi, D (corresponding author), Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Kota Bandung, Indonesia.",dadang.juandi@upi.edu; yayaskusumah@yahoo.com; maximustamur@unikastpaulus.ac.id,"Tamur, Maximus/ABH-5560-2020","Tamur, Maximus/0000-0002-2185-8415",,,,59,0,0,1,1,"GATE ASSOC TEACHING & EDUCATION-GATE, SWITZERLAND",BASEL,"GATE ASSOC TEACHING & EDUCATION-GATE, SWITZERLAND, BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1694-609X,1308-1470,,INT J INSTR,Int.

To ideally offer an online learning environment that is accessible by all students to the greatest extent possible, this study employed the principles of the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework to analyse the design of online instructional resources for topics in first-year chemistry courses. Through application of UDL principles, students were provided with multiple means of representation of concepts, options for action and expression, and various avenues for engagement within the learning management system (LMS). This paper describes how the UDL framework was used to evaluate three separate independent Cases of tertiary first-year chemistry courses, including one university in the Philippines and two universities in Australia. Evaluation through surveys, focus groups, and individual interviews revealed students' perceptions of the usefulness of the UDL-based features. Students cited benefit from multiple forms of content delivery, animations, interactive simulations, and video recordings because they facilitated processing of information, provided alternative ways of presenting the information, allowed for varying methods for response, navigation, and flexibility, and allowed for self-evaluation of their progress. These results suggest that applying the principles of the UDL framework in instructional design of an online environment in first-year chemistry courses can support and further enhance students' learning irrespective of their individual contexts.","[Reyes, Charisse T.; Thompson, Christopher D.; Kyne, Sara H.] Monash Univ, Sch Chem, Fac Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Reyes, Charisse T.] Open Univ, Univ Philippines, Fac Educ, Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines; [Lawrie, Gwendolyn A.] Univ Queensland, Sch Chem & Mol Biosci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","Kyne, SH (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Chem, Fac Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",sara.kyne@monash.edu,"; Lawrie, Gwendolyn/B-9184-2014","Kyne, Sara H./0000-0002-6995-9311; Lawrie, Gwendolyn/0000-0001-9839-6231","One UP (University of the Philippines) Faculty Grant, Co-Funded Monash Graduate Scholarship; Monash Faculty of Science Dean's International Postgraduate Research Scholarship","The contributions made by participants from the first-year chemistry courses involved in this three-case study are gratefully acknowledged.

We find that in a cured sample, a moderate magnetic field leads mainly to in-place flake rotations that are fully reversed once the applied field is switched off. In contrast, in an initially non-cured sample the flakes perform both translation and rotations under the influence of a moderate applied field that lead to the formation of chain-like structures that remain such even if the field is switched off.","[Dobroserdova, Alla; Novak, Ekaterina; Kantorovich, Sofia] Ural Fed Univ, Inst Nat Sci & Math, Lenin Av 51, Ekaterinburg 620000, Russia; [Schuemann, Malte; Borin, Dmitry; Odenbach, Stefan] Tech Univ Dresden, Chair Magnetofluiddynam Measuring & Automat Techn, Inst Mechatron Engn, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Kantorovich, Sofia] Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, Kolingasse 14-16, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Kantorovich, Sofia] Univ Vienna, Res Platform MMM Math Magnetism Mat, Oskar Morgenstern Pl 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Dobroserdova, A (corresponding author), Ural Fed Univ, Inst Nat Sci & Math, Lenin Av 51, Ekaterinburg 620000, Russia.",alla.dobroserdova@urfu.ru,"Borin, Dmitry/D-4652-2009; Odenbach, Stefan/D-4542-2009; Kantorovich, Sofia/H-4586-2011; Novak, Ekaterina/K-9016-2013","Borin, Dmitry/0000-0003-3842-1487; Kantorovich, Sofia/0000-0001-5700-7009; Novak, Ekaterina/0000-0002-4034-6861","Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation [FEUZ-2020-0051]; RFBR-DFG [21-52-12013]; FWF [SAM P 33748]; DAAD: German Academic Exchange Service [91728503]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [Bo 3343/3-1, PAK907]; DFG [OD 18/21, SPP1681]","This research was supported by Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation, project no.

This may lead to cost-savings and, consequently, additional consumption with environmental impacts (rebound effects). In this study, a supervised machine-learning model (i.e. an application of random forest regression) is developed to quantify consumption rebound effects. In contrast to previous approaches, it is a versatile method, which allows to estimate any income-related rebound at household level considering specific household properties and the entire profile of consumption. Socio-economic properties (e.g. income, age group) of the households are used as the independent properties for the regressor to detect the dependent consumption expenses of the households. Thus, this method can be used as a bottom-up study for understanding rebounds and developing targeted measures to prevent or reduce rebound effects. To illustrate the application of the method, it is applied to the case of cooperative housing in Switzerland. In addition to environmental goals, the cooperative aims to provide affordable housing, and the reduced rent increases the disposable income of tenants. The results show that households tend to spend the 'extra' income on housing (e.g. for larger apartments) and travel. For the former, the cooperative already has a policy in place regulating the apartment area permitted per person, which delimits induced environmental impacts. For the latter, households with lower income particularly spend their extra-money on purchase and operation of vehicles, while high-erincome groups rather spend it on recreation and package holidays. Travel, housing, clothing and personal care products have highest emissions per Swiss Franc (similar to 0.3-0.6 kg CO2-eq/CHF). Thus, it is recommended to provide incentives for shifting these expenses to other consumption, to avoid jeopardizing environmental goals. The method was also used for a range of other applications e.g. rebounds due to energy-efficient devices to illustrate its versatility.","[Shinde, Rhythima; Froemelt, Andreas; Kim, Aleksandra; Hellweg, Stefanie] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn Ecol Syst Design, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, John von Neumann Weg 9, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Froemelt, Andreas] Singapore ETH Ctr CREATE, Future Cities Lab Global, Zurich Hub, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kim, Aleksandra] Paul Scherrer Inst, Technol Assessment Grp, Forschungsstr 111, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland","Shinde, R (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn Ecol Syst Design, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, John von Neumann Weg 9, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",shinde@ifu.baug.ethz.ch; froemelt@ifu.baug.ethz.ch; aleksandra.kim@psi.ch; stefanie.hellweg@ifu.baug.ethz.ch,"Hellweg, Stefanie/AAA-7756-2019; Froemelt, Andreas/F-3078-2015","Hellweg, Stefanie/0000-0001-6376-9878; Froemelt, Andreas/0000-0001-9388-7816; Shinde, Rhythima/0000-0003-3435-3202; , Aleksandra/0000-0001-7556-2233",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [407340_172445],"Rhythima Shinde and Aleksandra Kim were supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) Grant-407340_172445 within the framework of the National Research Program Sustainable Economy: resource-friendly, future-oriented, innovative (NRP73) .

The ability of FUS to stimulate the nervous system, in a noninvasive and spatiotemporally precise manner, has been demonstrated in animals and human subjects, but the underlying biomechanisms are not fully understood yet. The objective of the present study was to investigate the bioeffects involved in the generation of trains of action potentials (APs) by repetitive-pulse FUS stimuli in a simple invertebrate neural model. Methods The respective influences of different acoustic parameters on the neurostimulation success rate (NSR), defined as the rate of FUS stimuli capable of evoking at least one AP, were explored using the system of afferent nerves and giant fibers of Lumbricus terrestris as neural model. Each parameter was studied independently by administering random FUS sequences while keeping all but one FUS parameter constant. The NSR was evaluated as a function of (i) the spatial-average pulse-average intensity (I-sapa); (ii) the pulse duration (PD); (iii) the pulse repetition frequency (PRF); iv) the number of cycles per pulse (N-cycles); (v) two ultrasound frequencies, f(0) = 1.1 MHz and f(3) = 3.3 MHz, corresponding to the fundamental and third-harmonic resonant frequencies of the FUS transducer, respectively (spherical, radius of curvature: 50 mm); and (vi) levels of emerging stable cavitation and inertial cavitation. Results The NSR associated to 1.1 MHz repetitive-pulse FUS stimuli was found to increase as a function of increasing I-sapa, PD, PRF, and N-cycles. When evaluating each parameter at f = 1.1 MHz, it was observed that NSRs close to 100% were achieved when sufficiently elevating their respective values. When computing the NSR as a function of the spatial-average, temporal-average intensity (I-sata), defined as the product of PRF, PD, and I-sapa, a significant elevation of the NSR from 0% to close to 100% was measured by increasing I-sata from values approximate to 4 W/cm(2) to values higher than 12 W/cm(2). No clear and consistent trend was observed in trials aimed at exploring the effects of different levels of stable and inertial acoustic cavitation on the NSR. Finally, the feasibility of inducing neural responses with 3.3 MHz repetitive-pulse FUS stimuli was also demonstrated with NSRs reaching up to 60%, in the range of FUS parameters studied. Conclusion The time-averaged value of the radiation force per unit volume of tissue is proportional to the acoustic intensity. As a result, the observations from this study suggest that the neural structure responding to the stimulus is sensitive to the mean radiation force carried by the FUS sequence, regardless of the combination of FUS parameters giving rise to such force. The results from this study further revealed the existence of a minimal activation threshold with regard to I-sapa.","[Vion-Bailly, Jeremy; Suarez-Castellanos, Ivan M.; Chapelon, Jean-Yves; N'Djin, W.

Therefore, there is a need to describe this flexibility in a concise manner. For the characterization of building energy flexibility, flexibility factors can be used. The comparison of a selection of existing flexibility factors shows that they are not easy to use or understand for designers and users. A simplification is necessary. The aim of this study is to introduce a flexibility classification that is easy to understand and shows in an easy way if a building already uses the lowest energy cost level or if further improvement is possible. The classification expresses the annual energy costs in colored classes: green (class A) for lowest up to red (class D) for highest level. Basically, the flexibility classes can be derived for any metric of interest, in this paper examples are shown for energy costs and CO2eq emissions.

Until now, these nonlinear resonances have been investigated only experimentally or using numerical calculations. In our opinion, the development of a simplified theoretical model of the observed resonances, which would provide explicit compact analytic expressions describing the line shape of the resonance, would be extremely important for further evolution of the theory. In this study, we perform such theoretical analysis based on the three-level ? scheme of the atom. We investigate two regimes, viz., the regime of a low-intensity standing wave with close intensities of counterpropagating beams (I-1 approximate to I-2) and the regime of a probe wave, in which one of the beams has a noticeably lower intensity than that of the oppositely propagating beam (I-2 MUCH LESS-THAN I-1). The resulting analytic expressions make it possible to determine qualitative differences between these regimes and to separate explicitly the contributions from different nonlinear effects to the light field absorption, including the terms responsible for the formation of a high-contrast sub-Doppler peak. The expressions derived here are in qualitative agreement with experimental data obtained earlier.","[Mikhailov, A.

The research sample consisted of 59 master's students from the Teacher Training for Primary Education (TTPE) program. To determine the level of geometric thinking of TTPE students, the van Hiele geometric test was used. Two geometric multi-item tasks were proposed and the students' solutions to these tasks were quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. The main goal was to analyze students' misconceptions while solving tasks and to compare and reveal the connections between their solutions and their achieved level of geometric thinking. A statistical implicative analysis was used for a deeper analysis, namely the statistical software C.H.I.C. The research findings show that more than 40% of TTPE students in the research sample did not reach the required level of geometric thinking. The achieved level of the geometric thinking of students is also influenced by the type of high school education. We observed problems with understanding the concept of the triangle and square in TTPE students.

Most employees were forced to work from home. People suddenly had to share common living spaces with family members for longer periods of time and convert home spaces into workplaces. This inevitably had a subjective impact on the perception, satisfaction and preference of indoor environmental quality and work productivity. A web-based survey was designed and administered to Italian employees to determine how they perceived the indoor environmental quality of residential spaces when Working From Home (WFH) and to investigate the relationship between different aspects of users' satisfaction. A total of 330 valid questionnaires were collected and analysed. The article reports the results of the analyses conducted using a descriptive approach and predictive models to quantify comfort in living spaces when WFH, focusing on respondents' satisfaction. Most of them were satisfied with the indoor environmental conditions (89% as the sum of very satisfied and satisfied responses for thermal comfort, 74% for visual comfort, 68% for acoustic quality and 81% for indoor air quality), while the layout of the furniture negatively influenced the WFH experience: 45% of the participants expressed an unsatisfactory or neutral opinion. The results of the sentiment analysis confirmed this trend. Among the Indoor Environmental factors that affect productivity, visual comfort is the most relevant variable. As for the predictive approach using machine learning, the Support Vector Machine classifier performed best in predicting overall satisfaction.","[Salamone, Francesco; Barozzi, Benedetta; Bellazzi, Alice; Belussi, Lorenzo; Danza, Ludovico; Devitofrancesco, Anna; Ghellere, Matteo; Meroni, Italo; Scamoni, Fabio; Scrosati, Chiara] Natl Res Council Italy ITC CNR, Construct Technol Inst, Via Lombardia 49, I-20098 Milan, Italy","Salamone, F (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy ITC CNR, Construct Technol Inst, Via Lombardia 49, I-20098 Milan, Italy.",salamone@itc.cnr.it; barozzi@itc.cnr.it; bellazzi@itc.cnr.it; belussi@itc.cnr.it; danza@itc.cnr.it; devitofrancesco@itc.cnr.it; ghellere@itc.cnr.it; meroni@itc.cnr.it; scamoni@itc.cnr.it; scrosati@itc.cnr.it,"Salamone, Francesco/O-4213-2015; Danza, Ludovico/B-6954-2015; Scrosati, Chiara/J-8649-2016; belussi, lorenzo/C-7504-2017","Salamone, Francesco/0000-0003-3215-3979; Danza, Ludovico/0000-0003-3305-4008; Barozzi, Benedetta/0000-0001-7310-4343; BELLAZZI, ALICE/0000-0002-2861-8094; Scrosati, Chiara/0000-0003-3888-7826; Devitofrancesco, Anna/0000-0003-3491-5543; belussi, lorenzo/0000-0002-1341-0602",,,,47,2,2,10,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,DEC,2021.0,11.0,12,,,,,,,660,10.3390/buildings11120660,,31,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,XX0BR,WOS:000735973300001,,gold,,,2022-07-14

For the scope of aeroelastic analyses, the AL model is coupled with an in-house multibody dynamics code in which the blades are modeled as beams. The advantage from the introduction of CFD analysis in rotorcraft aeroelasticity is related to its capability to account in detail for the interaction of the rotor wake with the boundary layer developed on the surrounding bodies. This has proven to be of great importance in order to accurately estimate the aerodynamic forces and thus the corresponding structural loads and deflections of the blades. In wind turbine applications, a good example of the above is the rotor/ground interaction. In helicopter configurations, the interaction of MR with the ground or the fuselage and the interaction of tail rotor with the duct in fenestron configurations are typical examples. Furthermore, CFD aerodynamic analysis is an obvious modeling option in which the above mentioned asset can be combined with the consideration of the mutual interaction of the rotor with the ambient turbulence. A WT rotor operating inside the atmospheric boundary layer under turbulent free-stream flow is such a case. In the paper, AL results are compared against Blade Element Momentum (BEM) and Lifting Line (LL) model results in the case of the WT, whereas LL and measured data are considered in the helicopter cases. Blade loads and deflections are mainly compared as azimuthal variations. In the helicopter MR cases, where comparison is made against experimental data, harmonic analysis of structural loads is shown as well. Overall, AL proves to be as reliable as LL in the canonical cases addressed in this paper in terms of loads and deflections predictions. Therefore, it can be trusted in more complex flow conditions where viscous effects are pronounced.","[Spyropoulos, Nikos; Prospathopoulos, John M.; Riziotis, Vasilis A.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, GR-15780 Athens, Greece; [Papadakis, George] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Naval & Marine Engn, GR-15780 Athens, Greece","Spyropoulos, N; Riziotis, VA (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, GR-15780 Athens, Greece.",nspyro@fluid.mech.ntua.gr; papis@fluid.mech.ntua.gr; jprosp@fluid.mech.ntua.gr; vasilis@fluid.mech.ntua.gr,,"Prospathopoulos, John/0000-0003-3318-8807; Papadakis, George/0000-0002-2742-5258; Riziotis, Vasilis/0000-0003-0104-1608; Spyropoulos, Nikolaos/0000-0001-9236-8133",Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI) under the HFRI PhD Fellowship grant [797];  [pr005019_thin];  [pr010013_thin],The research work was supported by the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI) under the HFRI PhD Fellowship grant (Fellowship Number: 797).,,63,1,1,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

The result of this study shows that online coaching can equip teachers with the ability to design and implement the RADEC learning model. However, it has not been able to equip teachers with the ability to develop pupils' creativity optimally on the concept of separation mixture and electricity. This indicates that an improvement is needed for the next coaching, in which teachers show their comprehension in a form of microteaching before they teach in an online classroom platform.

Thus, as a food chemistry teacher, it has been my mission to continually search for and implement better ways to help my students learn chemistry. One strategy for improved learning, based on Johnstone's Triangle, that has been shown to be exceedingly effective, is to intentionally and explicitly provide students with opportunities to see and experience chemistry at the macroscopic level (things they can observe), so that they can make a more meaningful and lasting connection to the molecular level (things they cannot directly observe). Thus, the focus of this article is to share with you six demonstrations and one assignment that help make chemistry visible to students, providing them with a macromolecular manifestation of a molecular level property or event. Featured demonstrations are grouped into two categories: The Properties of Water Demonstrations (Water's #1 Superpower: Hydrogen Bonding) and The Phase Transitions of Water Demonstrations (Water's #2 Superpower: Shapeshifting).

Evidence suggests that within gliomas there is a small subpopulation of cells with the capacity for self-renewal, called glioma stem cells. These cells could be responsible for tumorigenesis, chemo and radioresistance, and finally for the recurrence of the tumor. Fluorescence-guided resection have improved the results of treatment against this disease, prolonging the survival of patients by a few months. Also, clinical trials have reported potential improvements in the therapeutic response after photodynamic therapy. Thus far, there are few published works that show the response of glioblastoma stem-like cells to photodynamic therapy. Here, we present a brief review exclusively commenting on the therapeutic approaches to eliminate glioblastoma stem cells and on the research publications about this topic of glioblastoma stem cells in relation to photodynamic therapy. It is our hope that this review will be useful to provide an overview about what is known to date on the topic and to promote the generation of new ideas for the eradication of glioblastoma stem cells by photodynamic treatment.","[Rodriguez Aguilar, Lechner] Univ La Habana, Havana, Cuba; [Laura Vilchez, Maria; Milla Sanabria, Laura N.] Univ Nacl Rio Cuarto UNRC, INBIAS, CONICET UNRC, Dept Biol Mol,Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis Quim & Nat, RA-5800 Cordoba, Argentina","Sanabria, LNM (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Rio Cuarto UNRC, INBIAS, CONICET UNRC, Dept Biol Mol,Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis Quim & Nat, RA-5800 Cordoba, Argentina.",lmilla@exa.unrc.edu.ar,,,,,,110,0,0,7,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1572-1000,1873-1597,,PHOTODIAGN PHOTODYN,Photodiagnosis Photodyn.

This evolution demands a better understanding of the ALD nucleation process on polymers, which has not been reported in a visual way. Herein, a visual study of ALD nucleation on polymers is presented, based on the different dry etching speeds between polymers (fast) and metal oxides (slow). An etching process removes the polyimide with the nucleating ALD acting as a mask, making the nucleation features visible through secondary electron microscopy analyses. The nucleation of both Al2O3 and HfO2 on polyimide was investigated. Both materials followed an island-coalescence nucleation. First, local islands formed, progressively coalescing into filaments, which connected and formed meshes. These meshes evolved into porous layers that eventually grew to a full layer, marking the end of the nucleation. Cross-sections were analyzed, observing no sub-surface growth. This approach was used to evaluate the influence of plasma-activating polyimide on the nucleation. Plasma-induced oxygen functionalities provided additional surface reactive sites for the ALD precursors to adsorb and start the nucleation. The presented nucleation study proved to be a straightforward and simple way to evaluate ALD nucleation on polymers.","[Astoreca, Laura; Schaubroeck, David; de Beeck, Maaike Op; De Smet, Herbert] IMEC, Ctr Microsyst Technol CMST, Technol Pk Zwijnaarde 126, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Astoreca, Laura; Schaubroeck, David; de Beeck, Maaike Op; De Smet, Herbert] Univ Ghent, Technol Pk Zwijnaarde 126, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Astoreca, Laura; Tabaei, Parinaz Saadat Esbah; Ghobeira, Rouba; Morent, Rino; De Geyter, Nathalie] Univ Ghent, Res Unit Plasma Technol RUPT, Dept Appl Phys, Fac Engn & Architecture, Sint Pietersnieuwstr 41,B4, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Astoreca, L (corresponding author), IMEC, Ctr Microsyst Technol CMST, Technol Pk Zwijnaarde 126, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.;Astoreca, L (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Technol Pk Zwijnaarde 126, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.;Astoreca, L (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Res Unit Plasma Technol RUPT, Dept Appl Phys, Fac Engn & Architecture, Sint Pietersnieuwstr 41,B4, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",laura.astorecaalvarez@ugent.be; David.Schaubroeck@UGent.be; ParinazSaadat.EsbahTabaei@Ugent.be; Rouba.Ghobeira@Ugent.be; Maaike.OpdeBeeck@imec.be; Rino.Morent@Ugent.be; herbert.desmet@ugent.be; Nathalie.DeGeyter@Ugent.be,"Astoreca, Laura/ABF-3199-2021; De Smet, Herbert/D-1221-2010; Esbah Tabaei, Parinaz Saadat/AFS-9077-2022; De Geyter, Nathalie/N-7201-2019","Astoreca, Laura/0000-0002-1668-1256; De Smet, Herbert/0000-0001-9640-8454; Esbah Tabaei, Parinaz Saadat/0000-0001-6419-2951; De Geyter, Nathalie/0000-0001-7883-5786; Schaubroeck, David/0000-0001-9576-3091",Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) [G086717N],FundingThis research study was supported by a research grant (G086717N) from the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO).,,104,0,0,6,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-6412,,COATINGS,Coatings,NOV,2021.0,11.0,11,,,,,,,1352,10.3390/coatings11111352,,20,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Coatings & Films; Physics, Applied",Materials Science; Physics,XG5RZ,WOS:000724811300001,,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-07-14

However, this may be challenging in mature wind energy markets, where many advantageous wind locations are already engaged by older wind farms, potentially generating suboptimal wind harvesting. This research developed a novel method to systematically analyze diverse factors to determine the level of maturity of wind markets and evaluate the adequacy of wind farm repowering at regional and individual levels. The approach was applied to wind markets in the United States (U.S.), in which several states were identified as having diverse levels of maturity. Results obtained from case studies in Texas indicated a consequential number of wind farms that have reached their twenty-year end-of-life term and earlier obsolescence levels. The proposed approach aided in determining wind farms that may benefit from total or partial repowering. The method indicated that total repowering of selected installations would significantly increase overall wind energy generation, considering that these older installations have access to some of the best wind speeds, infrastructure and areas to grow. The proposed method can be applied to different world wind markets.","[Haces-Fernandez, Francisco] Texas A&M Univ Kingsville, Coll Business Adm, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA","Haces-Fernandez, F (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ Kingsville, Coll Business Adm, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA.",Francisco.HacesFernandez@tamuk.edu,"Haces-Fernandez, Francisco/R-4649-2017","Haces-Fernandez, Francisco/0000-0001-8997-4095","College of Business Administration 2021-2022 Summer Research Grant at Texas A&M University, Kingsville","This research was funded by the College of Business Administration 2021-2022 Summer Research Grant at Texas A&M University, Kingsville.",,52,1,1,10,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,NOV,2021.0,14.0,22,,,,,,,7716,10.3390/en14227716,,19,Energy & Fuels,Energy & Fuels,XH9KH,WOS:000725744000001,,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-07-14

For narrow (1-4 mm horizontal extent) domains, we demonstrate active instabilities that are uniquely double-diffusive, or in other words that no instabilities develop when differential diffusion is not present. The novel double-diffusive instabilities are influenced by the boundaries, but demonstrate complex time-dependent evolution down to lateral extents of 1.25 mm. We quantify the energetics, the horizontal asymmetry, and the buoyancy flux due to the instability. We utilize these results to characterize the instability within regimes and point out that while coherent instabilities associated with larger gaps are well characterized by the ratio of diffusive effects to buoyancy forces (the time dependent Grashof number), for smaller gap widths, regime characterization is more difficult. Nevertheless, even at a gap of 1.25 mm, the instability remains robust, and thus it can be concluded that double diffusion can be employed to drive localized mixing in highly confined settings for which single constituent Rayleigh-Taylor does not manifest.","[Legare, Sierra; Grace, Andrew; Stastna, Marek] Univ Waterloo, Dept Appl Math, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Legare, S (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Appl Math, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",slegare@uwaterloo.ca,,"Legare, Sierra/0000-0003-2341-4305; Grace, Andrew/0000-0001-9616-025X; Stastna, Marek/0000-0003-1770-2044",NSERC Discovery Grant [RGPIN-311844-37157],This work was supported by NSERC Discovery Grant No. RGPIN-311844-37157.,,41,3,3,2,5,AIP Publishing,MELVILLE,"1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",1070-6631,1089-7666,,PHYS FLUIDS,Phys.

However, the knowledge regarding differences in polarimetric signatures of different tissue pathologies is very scattered, confounding the deduction of a global trend of the polarimetric variables for healthy and pathological tissues. The purpose of this study was to bridge this gap. We conducted a rigorous online survey to collect all published studies that report the two most common polarimetric variables (i.e., depolarization and retardance) for any type of tissue pathology. A total of 101 studies describing the polarimetric assessment of tissues were collected, wherein 253 (i.e., n(human) = 149, n(animal) = 104) different type of tissues were optically characterized. Most tissue samples (172/253) were investigated in ex vivo settings. The data showed 32 different types of tissues pathologies, where the most common pathology was cancer and its subtypes. The skin tissues were the most frequently explored tissues, followed by tissue samples from breast, colon, liver, and cervix. Although differences in polarimetric signatures of different tissue pathologies were summarized from the included studies, generalization of the results was hindered by the presentation of polarimetric data in a non-uniform format. The analyses presented in this study may provide an important reference for future polarimetric studies that conduct optical assessment of tissues at greater depth, particularly in the context of optical biopsy/digital staining.","[Ali, Zahra; Mahmood, Tariq; Shahzad, Ayesha] DHQ & Teaching Hosp, Sahiwal, Pakistan; [Iqbal, Muaz] Islamia Coll Peshawar, Dept Phys, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Iftikhar] Inst Radiotherapy & Nucl Med IRNUM, Peshawar, Pakistan","Ahmad, I (corresponding author), Inst Radiotherapy & Nucl Med IRNUM, Peshawar, Pakistan.",iahmadmp@gmail.com,,"Ahmad, Iftikhar/0000-0002-2377-5808",,,,120,0,0,5,9,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-8921,1435-604X,,LASER MED SCI,Lasers Med.

This report demonstrates tunable optimization of inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) at cryogenic temperature to fabricate vertically-aligned silicon nanowire array anodes with high verticality, controllable morphology, and good homogeneity. Three different materials [i.e., photoresist, chromium (Cr), and silicon dioxide (SiO2)] were employed as masks during the subsequent photolithography and cryogenic ICP-RIE processes to investigate their effects on the resulting nanowire structures. Silicon nanowire arrays with a high aspect ratio of up to 22 can be achieved by tuning several etching parameters [i.e., temperature, oxygen/sulfur hexafluoride (O-2/SF6) gas mixture ratio, chamber pressure, plasma density, and ion energy]. Higher compressive stress was revealed for longer Si wires by means of Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, an anisotropy of lattice stress was found at the top and sidewall of Si nanowire, indicating compressive and tensile stresses, respectively. From electrochemical characterization, half-cell battery integrating ICP-RIE-based silicon nanowire anode exhibits a capacity of 0.25 mAh cm(-2) with 16.67% capacity fading until 20 cycles, which has to be improved for application in future energy storage devices.","[Refino, Andam Deatama; Yulianto, Nursidik; Syamsu, Iqbal; Syring, Alina; Peiner, Erwin; Wasisto, Hutomo Suryo] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Semicond Technol IHT, Hans Sommer Str 66, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [Refino, Andam Deatama; Yulianto, Nursidik; Syamsu, Iqbal; Syring, Alina; Voss, Tobias; Peiner, Erwin; Wasisto, Hutomo Suryo] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Lab Emerging Nanometrol LENA, Langer Kamp 6, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [Refino, Andam Deatama] Inst Teknol Sumatera ITERA, Engn Phys Program, Way Huwi, Lampung Selatan 35365, Lampung, Indonesia; [Yulianto, Nursidik] Natl Res & Innovat Agcy BRIN, Res Ctr Phys, Jl Kawasan Puspiptek 441-442, South Tangerang 15314, Indonesia; [Syamsu, Iqbal] Natl Res & Innovat Agcy BRIN, Res Ctr Elect & Telecommun, Jl Sangkuriang Komplek LIPI Gedung 20, Bandung 40135, Indonesia; [Nugroho, Andika Pandu; Hawari, Naufal Hanif; Sumboja, Afriyanti] Inst Teknol Bandung, Fac Mech & Aerosp Engn, Mat Sci & Engn Res Grp, Jl Ganesha 10, Bandung 40132, Indonesia; [Kartini, Evvy] Natl Nucl Energy Agcy BATAN, Ctr Sci & Technol Adv Mat, South Tangerang 15314, Indonesia; [Iskandar, Ferry] Inst Teknol Bandung, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Dept Phys, Jl Ganesha 10, Bandung 40132, Indonesia; [Wasisto, Hutomo Suryo] PT Nanosense Instrument Indonesia, Umbulharjo 55167, Yogyakarta, Indonesia","Refino, AD; Wasisto, HS (corresponding author), Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Semicond Technol IHT, Hans Sommer Str 66, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany.;Refino, AD; Wasisto, HS (corresponding author), Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Lab Emerging Nanometrol LENA, Langer Kamp 6, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany.;Refino, AD (corresponding author), Inst Teknol Sumatera ITERA, Engn Phys Program, Way Huwi, Lampung Selatan 35365, Lampung, Indonesia.;Wasisto, HS (corresponding author), PT Nanosense Instrument Indonesia, Umbulharjo 55167, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.",andam.refino@tu-braunschweig.de; h.wasisto@nanosense-id.com,"Wasisto, Hutomo Suryo/ABF-9543-2020; Iskandar, Ferry/D-4881-2017; Iskandar, Ferry/A-6696-2009","Wasisto, Hutomo Suryo/0000-0002-4522-3625; Iskandar, Ferry/0000-0002-0464-0035","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) under the Southeast Asia-Europe Joint Funding Scheme (SEA-EU JFS) for Research and Innovation; Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia (RISTEKDIKTI) [T/912/D3.2/KD.02.01/2019, 34/RISET-Pro/FGS/III/2019]; Indonesian-German Centre for Nano and Quantum Technologies (IG-Nano); EMPIR programme [19ENG05]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [GrK1952/1]; strategic research initiative Quantum-and Nanometrology (QUANOMET)","This work was conducted within a project of SiNanoBatt funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) under the Southeast Asia-Europe Joint Funding Scheme (SEA-EU JFS) for Research and Innovation.

With extensive applications of machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool to achieve optimal strategies, which constructively leads to the result that parameter optimization can be performed by RL. In this paper, we provide the concept of simplified RL formally and show the corresponding properties. In order to implement simplified RL for flow control, a high-order numerical approach is coupled with simplified RL to develop a new framework for parameter optimization and determination. In order to validate the performance of the framework, flows past a rotary oscillating circular cylinder at low Reynolds number Re = 200 (defined as R e = U infinity D / nu, where U infinity is the free-stream velocity and nu is the kinematic viscosity) are investigated by varying the parameters of rotary amplitude and frequency individually or simultaneously. By numerical investigations, a satisfactory drag reduction effect is achieved, which demonstrates the capability of the framework to perform parameter optimization in terms of open-loop control.","[Lai, Pengyu; Wang, Rui; Xu, Hui] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Aeronaut & Astronaut, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wei] Marine & Res Inst China, Sci & Technol Water Jet Prop Lab, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Xu, H (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Aeronaut & Astronaut, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",dr.hxu@sjtu.edu.cn,"; Xu, Hui/E-1549-2011","Lai, Pengyu/0000-0002-1748-7017; Xu, Hui/0000-0001-8448-4425",National Natural Science Foundation of China [91852106]; National Numerical Wind Tunnel Project [NNW2019ZT4-B09],ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to acknowledge support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 91852106) and National Numerical Wind Tunnel Project (Grant No. NNW2019ZT4-B09).

The focus is on monochromatic ripples of frequency in the range 0.1-10 kHz. A capillary wave apparatus has been constructed that combines several recent advances on the technique. It is based on the profilometry of waves decaying with distance, with a high-speed video camera detecting the light refracted by the surface. A code to process the images has been developed, which executes a regression analysis to determine the characteristics of the wave. High precision and accuracy have been achieved: standard deviation from the mean of +/- 0.5% for the wavelength and +/- 7% for the decay length; mean deviations from the theoretical values +/- 0.2% for the wavelength and +/- 5% for the decay length. An analytic approximation for the dispersion relation has been used to determine the Gibbs elasticity of a surfactant monolayer from the data for decay length vs frequency. The elasticity of an octanol monolayer has been determined with precision of +/- 1 mN/m, in excellent agreement with the theoretical value. Surface tension can be measured from the wavelength data with precision of +/- 0.3 mN/m. It has been demonstrated that the effect of the surface elasticity on the wavelength is significant, and accurate wavelength data can actually be used to determine the elasticity if the surface tension is known.","[Slavchov, Radomir, I; Peychev, Boyan; Ismail, A.

A large number of metal nanoparticles (NPs) are extensively exploited for biomedical applications. Metal NPs, in particular platinum NPs (PtNPs), possess remarkable properties that make them a potential candidate as a diagnostic or therapeutic agent. Due to potential technological interest over the last decade, PtNPs have attracted much attention in the field of anticancer research. PtNPs, when conjugated with many functionalizing agents such as polymers, ligands, drugs, peptides, and surfactants, exhibit improved targeting and reduced cytotoxic effects in various cancers. The PtNPs conjugated with folic acid, graphene oxide, and iron NPs are gained more attention due to their stability, large surface area, and reduced toxicity. To achieve this goal, PtNPs are co-loaded with drugs or other modalities that offer an opportunity for multimodal activity in the frame of treating cancer types focusing on breast, blood, lung, ovarian, skin, liver, etc. However, a review of PtNPs' function in diagnosis and treatment is still lacking.

In addition to HIFU frequency, peak rarefactional pressure (p(-)), and pulse duration, the threshold for cavitation-induced bioeffects has recently been correlated with asymmetric distortion caused by nonlinear propagation, diffraction and formation of shocks in the focal waveform, and therefore with the transducer F-number. To connect previously observed bioeffects with bubble dynamics and their attendant physical mechanisms, the dependence of inertial cavitation behavior on shock formation was investigated in transparent agarose gel phantoms using high-speed photography and passive cavitation detection (PCD). Agarose phantoms with concentrations ranging from 1.5% to 5% were exposed to 1-ms pulses using three transducers of the same aperture but different focal distances (F-numbers of 0.77, 1.02, and 1.52). Pulses had central frequencies of 1, 1.5, or 1.9 MHz and a range of p(-) at the focus varying within 1-18 MPa. Three distinct categories of bubble behavior were observed as the acoustic power increased: stationary near-spherical oscillation of individual bubbles, proliferation of multiple bubbles along the pHIFU beam axis, and fanned-out proliferation toward the transducer. Proliferating bubbles were only observed under strongly nonlinear or shock-forming conditions regardless of frequency, and only where the bubbles reached a certain threshold size range. In stiffer gels with higher agarose concentrations, the same pattern of cavitation behavior was observed, but the dimensions of proliferating clouds were smaller. These observations suggest mechanisms that may be involved in bubble proliferation: enhanced growth of bubbles under shock-forming conditions, subsequent shock scattering from the gel-bubble interface, causing an increase in the repetitive tension created by the acoustic wave, and the appearance of a new growing bubble in the proximal direction. Different behaviors corresponded to specific spectral characteristics in the PCD signals: broadband noise in all cases, narrow peaks of backscattered harmonics in the case of stationary bubbles, and broadened, shifted harmonic peaks in the case of proliferating bubbles. The shift in harmonic peaks can be interpreted as a Doppler shift from targets moving at speeds of up to 2 m/s, which correspond to the observed bubble proliferation speeds.","[Bawiec, Christopher R.; Khokhlova, Tatiana D.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Div Gastroenterol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Rosnitskiy, Pavel B.; Sapozhnikov, Oleg A.; Khokhlova, Vera A.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Phys Fac, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Peek, Alex T.; Kreider, Wayne; Sapozhnikov, Oleg A.; Khokhlova, Vera A.] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Ctr Ind & Med Ultrasound, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Maxwell, Adam D.] Univ Washington, Dept Urol, Sch Med, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ter Haar, Gail R.] Inst Canc Res, Div Radiotherapy & Imaging, Sutton SM2 5PT, Surrey, England","Khokhlova, TD (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Med, Div Gastroenterol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",tdk7@uw.edu,"Kreider, Wayne/M-5953-2015; Khokhlova, Vera A/A-2813-2012; Rosnitskiy, Pavel/O-9858-2015","Kreider, Wayne/0000-0002-8403-4835; Khokhlova, Vera A/0000-0002-2585-8228; Rosnitskiy, Pavel/0000-0001-6423-3506; ter Haar, Gail/0000-0001-8909-0775","National Institutes of Health [R01 R01EB023910, K01DK104854, R01EB7643, P01DK043881]; Russian Science Foundation [RSF 20-12-00145]","This work was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health under Grant R01 R01EB023910, Grant K01DK104854, Grant R01EB7643, and under Grant P01DK043881 and in part by Russian Science Foundation under Grant RSF 20-12-00145.",,28,2,2,8,12,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0885-3010,1525-8955,,IEEE T ULTRASON FERR,IEEE Trans.

This paper investigates the effects of antecedents on behavioral intention in m-commerce and the role of consumer satisfaction in the buyer decision process. In our investigation, we used the modified technology acceptance model (TAM). The research was conducted through a survey based on a self-administered questionnaire, with the data being analyzed by structural equation modeling and cross-tabulation. Following the investigation, we found that perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEU) positively influence behavioral intention. Consumer satisfaction also plays a significantly positive role in m-commerce actual use, influencing future behavioral intention. The results also showed that generational and gender differences strongly affect behavioral intention, with younger generations and male respondents being more inclined to use m-commerce.","[Varzaru, Anca Antoaneta] Univ Craiova, Dept Econ Accounting & Int Business, Craiova 200585, Romania; [Bocean, Claudiu George; Budica-Iacob, Adrian-Florin] Univ Craiova, Dept Management Mkt & Business Adm, Craiova 200585, Romania; [Rotea, Claudia Cristina] Univ Craiova, Fac Mech, Craiova 200585, Romania","Bocean, CG (corresponding author), Univ Craiova, Dept Management Mkt & Business Adm, Craiova 200585, Romania.",anca.varzaru@edu.ucv.ro; claudiu.bocean@edu.ucv.ro; cristina.rotea@edu.ucv.ro; adrian.budica@edu.ucv.ro,"Bocean, Claudiu George/AAG-9932-2020","Rotea, Claudia-Cristina/0000-0002-8914-5630; Bocean, Claudiu George/0000-0001-9714-1333; Varzaru, Anca Antoaneta/0000-0001-6045-204X",,,,90,6,6,9,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9292,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,SEP,2021.0,10.0,18,,,,,,,2231,10.3390/electronics10182231,,16,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,UV4KL,WOS:000699449400001,,gold,,,2022-07-14

The world economy has declined due to purchasing power for individuals who have been forced to stay at home and cannot perform work. These restrictions to prevent the spread of SARS-Cov-2 have led to an increase in electronic commerce and mobile commerce as tools for procuring goods and services. In this paper, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of mobile commerce as an essential electronic commerce component, establishing the main drivers of mobile commerce and the intensity of their influences. The research focuses on mobile commerce in the United States (U.S.). It covers the period 2010-2020, the last year of this period capturing the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on electronic commerce (e-commerce) and mobile commerce (m-commerce). In the macroeconomic analysis of competitiveness, we established the main drivers of m-commerce, using artificial neural networks and the mediation effects found between the variables that describe m-commerce, e-commerce, and total sales, using structural equation modeling. The research results indicate an increase in the share of e-commerce in total sales and a predominance of the m-commerce share in e-commerce on the background of traffic restrictions and social distance rules imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Stakeholders in the m-commerce area should consider the following enhancing drivers: increasing internet speed, expanding 5G and Wi-Fi networks, and increasing accessibility and trust in mobile devices and applications.","[Varzaru, Anca Antoaneta] Univ Craiova, Dept Econ Accounting & Int Business, Craiova 200585, Romania; [Bocean, Claudiu George] Univ Craiova, Dept Management Mkt & Business Adm, Craiova 200585, Romania","Varzaru, AA (corresponding author), Univ Craiova, Dept Econ Accounting & Int Business, Craiova 200585, Romania.",anca.varzaru@edu.ucv.ro; bocean.claudiu@ucv.ro,"Bocean, Claudiu George/AAG-9932-2020","Bocean, Claudiu George/0000-0001-9714-1333; Varzaru, Anca Antoaneta/0000-0001-6045-204X",,,,66,5,5,13,32,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0718-1876,,,J THEOR APPL EL COMM,J.

For this purpose, I argue, students need to be supported in considering many connections, to arrive at coherent trajectories. Based on complexity thinking and curriculum design with digital resources, I propose the concept of connectivity as a crucial principle for creating coherent curriculum trajectories. If students are to become the co-designers of their own curriculum, they need a frame that raises their awareness about the many connections to be made and that supports their capability for actually realizing them. Drawing strongly on my own work and related work by others, I analyse and illustrate the connections made by students, teachers and curriculum designers in their design of mathematics tasks, lessons and learning trajectories with digital resources. Results show that connections can be made at several levels, namely, at a social level, at a material level, at programme level, and at a didactical level. Leaning on systems thinking, connections can be systematically considered, which is likely to help students to enhance the coherence of their designs. I contend that a student-designed 'connected curriculum trajectory' is likely to become the focus of future research activities in innovative learning environments: this endeavor would connect aspects of curriculum, mathematical content, learning strategies of students, and the use of new technologies.","[Pepin, Birgit] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven Sch Educ, Eindhoven, Netherlands","Pepin, B (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven Sch Educ, Eindhoven, Netherlands.",b.e.u.pepin@tue.nl,,,,,,52,1,1,3,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-9690,1863-9704,,ZDM-MATH EDUC,ZDM-Math.

As the investigation of a rotating turbine can be challenging, both experimentally and numerically, static actuator discs can substitute rotating turbines. To investigate the similarity of the turbulence in the wakes and how turbulent inflow alters the result, an experimental wind tunnel study is presented that compares hot-wire measurements in the central wakes of an actuator disc and a model wind turbine (diameter-based Reynolds number Re z 300000). Two turbulent inflows are investigated, an intermittent, i.e. gusty, atmospheric-like inflow generated by an active grid, and a non-intermittent inflow generated by a regular grid. The data is investigated using one-point and higher-order two-point statistics. We find that the wakes of both models have similar properties for all investigated quantities within the far wake. The turbulence in the central wake is in-dependent of the inflow conditions, and both models filter larger scale intermittency in the far wake with regard to the inflow. Also, we find that the turbine generates its own kind of turbulence that dominates the ambient turbulence and has strong features of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is one of the new technologies rapidly and increasingly grabbing the attention of businesses. RPA tools allow mimicking human tasks by providing a virtual workforce, or digital workers in the form of software bots, for automating manual, high-volume, repetitive, and routine tasks. The goal is to allow human workers to delegate their tedious routine tasks to a software bot, thus allowing them to focus on more difficult tasks. RPA tools are simple and very powerful, according to cost-saving and other performance metrics. However, the main challenge of RPA implementation is to effectively determine the business tasks suitable for automation.

These methods are based on the simple pendulum method and drop weight method under a controlled environment with an automatic measurement system. Both cases are evaluated under different varying input quantities, and uncertainty evaluations are performed using the Monte Carlo method. From the results obtained for the simple pendulum case, it is found that as the length of the pendulum's string increases, the uncertainty in g-measurement decreases significantly. Similarly, for the drop weight system, the uncertainty in the measurement of g decreases up to two order with the increase in drop height of one order. Also, it is found that the drop weight system is more promising for a precise g-measurement over the simple pendulum case.","[Zafer, A.; Saha, S.; Yaday, S.; Jaiswal, S. K.; Aswal, D.

Uterine artery embolization (UAE) can achieve good results for CSP too. To investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of HIFU and UAE in the treatment of cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP), we conducted this research. Methods: Multiple databases were used to search for relevant studies and articles related to HIFU, UAE, and CSP. The selected literature were retrospectively evaluated using Review Manager 5.2. In addition, forest plots, sensitivity analysis, and bias analysis were conducted for the included literature. Results: Finally, 8 related studies met the inclusion criteria. There were no significant differences in postoperative adverse reactions and hospitalization time between the HIFU group and the UAE group. However, the normalization time of serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (B-HCG) in the HIFU group was higher than that in the UAE group [MD =1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.09, 2.22, P=0.03, I-2=93%], and the hospitalization cost in the HIFU group was significantly lower than that in the UAE group (MD =-8.81, 95% CI, -12.64, -4.97, P<0.00001, I-2=99%). Discussion: Our results show that HIFU and UAE have the same curative effect in the treatment of CSP, but HIFU has lower cost and fewer complications. These results supported that compared with UAE, HIFU is a better choice for CSP patients with long gestational age, large gestational sac diameter and high HCG level.","[Mi, Wei] Hubei Polytech Univ, Huangshi Matern & Childrens Hlth Hosp, Womens & Childrens Hosp, Dept Ultrasound,Edong Healthcare Grp, Huangshi, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Pei, Pei] Hubei Polytech Univ, Huangshi Cent Hosp, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Neurol,Edong Healthcare Grp, Huangshi, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Yuan] Hubei Polytech Univ, Edong Healthcare Grp, Huangshi Cent Hosp, Dept Ultrason,Imaging Div,Affiliated Hosp, 293 Hosp St, Huangshi 435000, Hubei, Peoples R China","Zheng, Y (corresponding author), Hubei Polytech Univ, Edong Healthcare Grp, Huangshi Cent Hosp, Dept Ultrason,Imaging Div,Affiliated Hosp, 293 Hosp St, Huangshi 435000, Hubei, Peoples R China.",yuanzheng98765@sina.com,,,,,,38,0,0,4,4,AME PUBL CO,SHATIN,"FLAT-RM C 16F, KINGS WING PLAZA 1, NO 3 KWAN ST, SHATIN, HONG KONG 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",2224-5820,2224-5839,,ANN PALLIAT MED,Ann.

First, two classes with similar levels are selected for the controlled trial. In the experimental research, the main research methods are questionnaires and experimental methodology. The definition of deep learning and computer modeling and simulation technology is briefly introduced. Moreover, the virtual classroom training mode formed by the combination of the two is introduced and applied to physical training. The survey results analysis of the students participating in the questionnaire reveals that due to the limitation of school and family resources, many students only know about the virtual classroom, but they have not used it. Most of the students are willing to accept the new physical training mode. In the use of virtual classroom in physical training, students hold that virtual classroom can improve the speed of proficiency in training content, and mobilize the learning interest in physical training content. Meanwhile, they hope that the virtual physical training content with computer modeling and simulation can develop in a more diversified way. Virtual simulation teaching can solve the limitation of venues and training equipment in traditional physical training, mobilize students' interest in classroom learning, and promote the reform and innovation of physical training.","[Zhang, Xiaojun] Xian Polytech Univ, Xian 710048, Peoples R China","Zhang, XJ (corresponding author), Xian Polytech Univ, Xian 710048, Peoples R China.",395323805@qq.com,,,,,,26,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INDIA,NEW DELHI,"7TH FLOOR, VIJAYA BUILDING, 17, BARAKHAMBA ROAD, NEW DELHI, 110 001, INDIA",0975-6809,0976-4348,,INT J SYST ASSUR ENG,Int.

Samples (5 mm diameter; 2, 3 and 4 mm thickness) were made of Universal Composite (UC), Bulk fill Composite (BC) and Flowable Composite (FC). Light curing of specimens was performed with 600, 1000 and 1500 mW/cm(2) light intensity and an irradiation time of 20, 40 and 60 s. Vickers microhardness on the top and bottom surfaces of samples was measured. Optimization was carried out via regression analysis using QStatLab software. Photopolymerization process parameters were calculated using a specially designed MatLab software-based algorithm. For all composites, regression models for hardness on top and bottom surfaces of composite layer were established. Layer thickness as well as hardness on top and bottom surfaces of each composite was calculated for 21 curing modes varying with light intensity and irradiation time. It was established that photopolymerization guidelines only of FC manufacturer guarantee the required hardness, while recommended regimes for UC and BC did not satisfy this requirement. Tables, containing recommended light curing regimes, were developed for three composite types, guaranteeing high hardness of composite restoration. They were designed to facilitate work of dentists in dental offices.","[Dikova, Tsanka; Georgiev, Georgi; Panov, Vladimir] Med Univ Varna, Fac Med Dent, 84 Tsar Osvoboditel Blvd, Varna 9000, Bulgaria; [Maximov, Jordan; Todorov, Vladimir] Tech Univ Gabrovo, Fac Mech Engn, 4 Hadji Dimitar Str, Gabrovo 5300, Bulgaria","Dikova, T (corresponding author), Med Univ Varna, Fac Med Dent, 84 Tsar Osvoboditel Blvd, Varna 9000, Bulgaria.",tsanka.dikova@mu-varna.bg; maximov@tugab.bg; v_p_todorov@abv.bg; Georgi.p.georgiev@mu-varna.bg; vladimir.panov@mu-varna.bg,"Dikova, Tsanka/W-4269-2019","Dikova, Tsanka/0000-0003-0266-9333; Georgiev, Georgi/0000-0002-4526-2819",,,,43,14,15,2,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9717,,PROCESSES,Processes,MAY,2021.0,9.0,5,,,,,,,779,10.3390/pr9050779,,14,"Engineering, Chemical",Engineering,SH9VV,WOS:000654478800001,,gold,,,2022-07-14

Careful manipulation of light exposure patterns can help reduce these negative effects but is challenging in conditions of rapidly rotating shiftwork and due to individual differences. As chronotype is related to shiftwork tolerance, we explored patterns of sleep, sleepiness, and light exposure during the first day of nightshift work between earlier and later chronotypes, based on data from an observational field study among rapidly rotating hospital nurses. Due to the limited sample size, only descriptive analyses and visual inspection were conducted. In line with findings of lower shiftwork tolerance, earlier chronotypes (N=6) seemed to be sleepier during work and sleep less than later types (N=7). Differences were also observed in light exposure patterns, revealing potential for light exposure interventions, and suggesting a contribution to shiftwork tolerance. For future intervention studies in aiming to identify a light exposure strategy, our findings highlight the importance of investigating light exposure relative to the individual circadian phase.","[Aarts, Marielle P.

This condition has the potential to result in the loss of our mental health. This is known by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an infodemic which is an excessive amount of information, both true and false, which makes it very difficult for people to find reliable news about the coronavirus, and has increased the spread of fake news, conspiracy theories, worldwide panic and confusion. WHO and all the governments of each country in the world have also carried out various efforts to break the chain of spreading fake news. But the spread of fake news around the world is faster than there is any control over it. Therefore, we need an awareness of each individual in order to equip themselves with the knowledge and skills in identifying fake news. Physics as a branch of science discipline cannot be separated from this fake news. One example of fake news about physics related to Covid-19 is the statement that the thermo gun used to measure body temperature is dangerous to human health because of its laser beam radiation. One alternative way that can be used to evaluate the truth of the news is by assessing the strength of the news argumentation. Toulmin's argument pattern has been widely applied to analyze the quality of an argument, which can be applied in evaluating the truth of a received news content. This paper aims to provide an alternative in identifying the infodemic in the Covid-19 Pandemic era in evaluating the correctness of information by applying the Toulmin Argument Pattern. This argumentation pattern distinguishes three fundamental components and three additional components of a coherent argumentative discourse. The main framework of this pattern in analyzing arguments consists of three main components: claim, data, and warrant. Where data provides the basis for determining claims, warrant acts as a logical reasoning bridge that connects data and claims. Three additional components can be added to construct a more complex pattern for analyzing arguments: backings, qualifiers, and rebuttals. Where backing is the part that provides additional evidence to strengthen the warrant, Qualifiers indicate the strength provided by the warrant in relating data to claims, while rebuttals indicate circumstances where the warrant in this condition is no longer valid so that the claim can be rejected.","[Admoko, S.; Suprapto, N.; Suliyanah; Deta, U.

The neoplastic lesions were developed under the influence of social stress and chemical stress using nitrosamines during a 9-month period of application. A significant fluorescence signal in the region of 670 - 720 nm was observed from the neoplastic lesions, which was absent in the normal mucosa. This signal is related to the fluorescence of phthalocyanines accumulated in the tumor area. The autofluorescence background covered the region of 450 - 650 nm with a maximum at 480 - 520 nm and originated mainly from protein cross-links and co-enzymes - NADH and flavins. Endogenous porphyrins fluorescence was also observed in the lesions with a maximum at 630 - 640 nm. Visually, the presence of accumulation sites of Pcs in the form of bright pink patches was observed after excitation at 405 nm, as opposed to a healthy tissue, which remained blue-violet due to the autofluorescence signal. This allows one to use the Pcs fluorescence discrimination not only in a spectroscopic mode of detection, but for imaging of the lesions investigated, which is preferable in clinical applications during endoscopic observations in humans.","[Agranovich, I; Khorovodov, Al; Kanevsky, M.; Semyachkina-Glushkovskaya, O.; Borisova, E.] Saratov NG Chernyshevskii State Univ, 83 Astrahanskaya Str, Saratov 410012, Russia; [Genova, Ts; Gisbrecht, Al; Borisova, E.] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Elect, 72 Tsarigradsko Chaussee, Sofia 1784, Bulgaria; [Angelov, I; Mantareva, V] Bulgarian Acad Sci BAS, Inst Organ Chem, Ctr Phytochem, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria; [Navolokin, N.] Saratov State Med Univ, Bolshaya Sadovaya Ulitsa 137, Saratov 410010, Russia","Agranovich, I (corresponding author), Saratov NG Chernyshevskii State Univ, 83 Astrahanskaya Str, Saratov 410012, Russia.",ilana.agranovich@yandex.ru,"Agranovich, Ilana/AAA-4329-2022; Genova, Tsanislava/L-3876-2016","Agranovich, Ilana/0000-0002-7903-3897; Mantareva, Vanya/0000-0002-7841-0910",Russian Science Foundation [18-15-00139],This work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation project #18-15-00139 Optical technologies for early diagnostics of stomach cancer.,,16,0,1,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1859.0,,,,,,,,12038,10.1088/1742-6596/1859/1/012038,,5,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Quantum Science & Technology; Optics; Physics, Applied",Engineering; Physics; Optics,BS2DU,WOS:000700377600038,,gold,,,2022-07-14

One of those efforts is mapping the fault location by using the gravity method that is sensitive to subsurface rock density changes. In this study, we used GGMplus gravity data then processed with derivative analysis (First Horizontal Derivative and Second Vertical Derivative) to determine the location and type of fault. By performing the slices, we found that this fault is oblique with strike-slip dominant tends to reverse fault. The azimuth discovered through fault position traces that the value is 47.5 degrees. Then, we use 3D inversion modeling to obtain a subsurface structure model. The average density is 2.3 g/cm(3). The model shows a distribution of limestone and sandstone sedimentary rocks reaches a 4 km depth. The clay sediments follow the river flow. In the southern part, there are andesite and granite igneous rocks.

The bubble has an equilibrium cylindrical shape and is bounded axially by two parallel solid surfaces. Dynamics of contact lines is taken into account by an effective boundary condition: velocity of the contact line is assumed to be proportional to contact angle deviation from the equilibrium value. The equilibrium contact angle is right. Different Hocking parameters determine individual damping rates, but dissipation in the integral system is determined by their total contribution. The frequency of the volume (breathing) harmonic of free oscillations can vanish in a certain interval of the values of the Hocking parameter for homogeneous plate surface.

The residential sector accounts for about 50% of total electricity consumption with approximately 70% of which is used for air-conditioning (AC) loads. This research investigates the role of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems to displace cooling loads, hence reducing residential electricity demand. Daily and annual electrical demands were monitored in a villa in Jeddah, and a range of PV systems were modelled to determine their ability to support AC and other household loads. Seasonal performance data of such systems were compared to monitored load variations to understand variability and yields. The monitored electrical demand of the villa was in the range 66-167 kWh/day which was used to estimate the required PV systems' capacities. The results indicate that PV systems in the range 2-10 kWp present significant shortfall to support the full demand. However, a 15kWp system was found to meet the daytime total loads. These results indicate that appropriately sized rooftop PV-systems can shave-off peak air-conditioning loads. The paper discusses the importance of utilising building integrated PV in such applications in SA, and highlights the need for dissemination at scale through country wide policy framework.","[Alam, M.; Bahaj, A.

The scattering problem is treated in a classic way by applying the T-matrix formalism and the resulting field is expressed on the basis of the different vibration modes of the particle. Compared to the case of a homogeneous plane incident wave, additional azimuthal scattered modes are excited and their contribution provokes a symmetry breaking of the field. Importantly, if a mode is preferentially excited by choosing the corresponding reduced frequency, the scattered radiation exhibits a spiral structure. The scattered field has a rotating phase around the scatterer which comes from the formation of spiral scattered waves and this effect is accentuated by increasing the evanescence degree of the incident wave. These results could have important implications for the contactless manipulation of objects with acoustic radiation forces and torques.","[Alhaitz, Ludovic; Baresch, Diego; Brunet, Thomas; Aristegui, Christophe; Poncelet, Olivier] Univ Bordeaux, INRAE, ENSAM, Bordeaux INP,UMR 5295 I2M, F-33405 Talence, France","Alhaitz, L (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, INRAE, ENSAM, Bordeaux INP,UMR 5295 I2M, F-33405 Talence, France.",ludovic.alhaitz@u-bordeaux.fr,"Brunet, Thomas/O-3658-2015",,,,,21,0,0,3,3,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1761.0,,,,,,,,12003,10.1088/1742-6596/1761/1/012003,,10,"Acoustics; Physics, Applied",Acoustics; Physics,BR9PQ,WOS:000679396100003,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-07-14

In contrast to a conventional floating offshore wind turbine, it has no moorings. Instead, the propellers are used to keep the wind turbine stationary. It may also be equipped with an on-board energy storage system (e.g. batteries, hydrogen, etc.) to avoid grid-connection. This concept is well suited for deployment in the far-offshore, where grid-connection and installation operations are challenging. As the propellers which are used to control the position of the wind turbine require power supply, the aim of this study is to investigate whether and in what conditions there can be a positive net power production. To this end, we have developed a velocity and power prediction program (VPPP) to estimate the power consumed by the propellers and the power generated by the wind turbine, as a function of wind conditions, and design parameters (e.g. diameter of the wind turbine and characteristics of the propellers rotors). The VPPP is based on Newton's first law of motion. The forces applied on the system are: the wind turbine thrust, the mean wave drift, and the propellers thrust. Inspired by an existing floating offshore wind concept, an example design has been developed. The diameter of the wind turbine's rotor is 78 m. Its rated power is 2 MW. The wind turbine is mounted on a 40 m square barge. The diameter of the propellers' rotor is 6 m. Using the VPPP, the power performance of this example design has been investigated as function of wind conditions. The maximum generated power is 0.89 MW. It is obtained for a true wind speed of 13.4 m/s. If deployed in the Northern Atlantic Ocean, this design could achieve a capacity factor of 15%, which is low in comparison to the 70% capacity factor which would be achieved by a moored floating offshore wind turbine if deployed at the same location.","[Alwan, R.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Math Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Babarit, A.; Gilloteaux, J.

However, precursor simulations can only handle gradually changing flow conditions, and are not capable of modelling highly transient and statistically non-stationary flows, e.g. frontal passages or large gusts. Such flows frequently occur in nature, and can influence the operation and potentially design of wind turbines. It is generally not possible to impose non-stationary features through inlet boundary conditions, if the imposed flow violates the most fundamental assumption of micro-scale flow simulations, namely conservation of mass. This work presents a method for modelling highly transient wind speed ramps by extending and adapting the method of applying body forces to achieve specific flow scenarios, where the wind speed ramps are embedded as constrained turbulent boxes. Several scenarios with significant increases in the streamwise wind speed are simulated. Analyses of the transient wake dynamics, as the wind speed ramps propagate through large wind farms are performed to show how well the momentum is maintained throughout the numerical domain and the influence and operation of turbines during the ramp passages.","[Andersen, S.

In this context, Building Information Modeling (BIM) emerges as a robust repository and data management tool to store, query, and assess long sequences of SHM data. Different sensors have been used to collect SHM data and digital sensors have been created in the BIM environment to mimic the behaviour of the physical ones on site.

Modification of the topography of the silicon carbide substrates could substantially improve the bioactivity properties of this material, which, after proper laser parameters optimization, could make its biomedical application even more successful.","[Angelova, L.; Daskalova, A.; Stanev, G.] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Elect, 72 Tsarigradsko Chaussee Blvd, Sofia 1784, Bulgaria; [Petit, F.] Belgian Ceram Res Ctr, Mons, Belgium; [Trifonov, A.; Buchvarov, I] St Kliment Ohridski Univ Sofia, Fac Phys, 5 James Bourchier Blvd, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Kandeva, M.] Tech Univ Sofia, Fac Ind Engn, Tribol Ctr, 8 Kl Ohridski Blvd, Sofia 1000, Bulgaria; [Kandeva, M.] South Ural State Univ, 76 Prospekt Lenina, Chelyabinsk, Russia","Angelova, L (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Elect, 72 Tsarigradsko Chaussee Blvd, Sofia 1784, Bulgaria.",liliya_angelova@ie.bas.bg,"Buchvarov, Ivan/AAM-6829-2021","Buchvarov, Ivan/0000-0002-7856-4741; Trifonov, Anton/0000-0002-1640-4849",Bulgarian National Science Funde [KP-06-H 38/5]; National Scientific Program [577/17.08.2018],"The work was partially supported under project KP-06-H 38/5 (2019-2022) Functionalization of 3D printed fibrous scaffolds via femtosecond laser patterning with the Bulgarian National Science Funde, and National Scientific Program Young scientists and post-doctorants CMR No. 577/17.08.2018 (2020), Preparation and design of porous polymer-based bio-interfaces and cell matrices by laser-induced microstructuring.",,6,0,0,14,26,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1859.0,,,,,,,,12015,10.1088/1742-6596/1859/1/012015,,6,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Quantum Science & Technology; Optics; Physics, Applied",Engineering; Physics; Optics,BS2DU,WOS:000700377600015,,gold,,,2022-07-14

The biopolymer-based scaffolds still need additional modification in order to impart complete biological cellular functioning and communication. In this study, a femtosecond laser-based method for surface modification was applied to improving the morphological properties of chitosan-based ZnO magnetron sputtered blends and chitosan matrices of different molecular weight, thus achieving different levels of morphological structures for creation of enhanced antibacterial cell surface environment. The microstructured scaffolds were investigated by SEM, EDX and FTIR. Wettability measurements were performed in order to determine the hydrophilicity of the treated surfaces. Changes in the water contact angle (WCA) values were monitored in the range from 120 degrees to 70 degrees by introducing diverse laser patterning conditions. Modifying the topography/morphology of the sputtered biopolymer blends can essentially improve their bioactivity properties; moreover, creating hierarchical porosity will affect its antibacterial features, which will enable their successful applications in tissue engineering.","[Angelova, L.; Daskalova, A.] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Elect, 72 Tsarigradsko Chaussee Blvd, Sofia 1784, Bulgaria; [Kalinkevich, A.; Kalinkevich, O.; Karpenko, A.] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Inst Appl Phys, Sumy, Ukraine; [Petrov, L.; Trifonov, A.; Buchvarov, I] St Kliment Ohridski Univ Sofia, Fac Phys, 5 James Bourchier Blvd, Sofia, Bulgaria","Angelova, L (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Elect, 72 Tsarigradsko Chaussee Blvd, Sofia 1784, Bulgaria.",liliya_angelova@ie.bas.bg,"Buchvarov, Ivan/AAM-6829-2021","Buchvarov, Ivan/0000-0002-7856-4741; Trifonov, Anton/0000-0002-1640-4849",project Functionalization of 3D printed fibrous scaffolds via femtosecond laser patterning [KP-06-H 38/5]; project NASU-BAS Synthesis of calcium phosphate and chitosan composites followed by femtosecond laser treatment for bioactivity improvement of bone scaffolds,The authors acknowledge the support of project KP-06-H 38/5 (2019-2022) Functionalization of 3D printed fibrous scaffolds via femtosecond laser patterning and project NASU-BAS Synthesis of calcium phosphate and chitosan composites followed by femtosecond laser treatment for bioactivity improvement of bone scaffolds 2019-2021.,,16,0,0,3,5,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1859.0,,,,,,,,12004,10.1088/1742-6596/1859/1/012004,,7,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Quantum Science & Technology; Optics; Physics, Applied",Engineering; Physics; Optics,BS2DU,WOS:000700377600004,,gold,,,2022-07-14

Besides, it caused a tsunami. This event occurred in the northern part of the Cendrawasih Bay, where the New Guinea Thrust segment had a relatively low average slip velocity. To obtain a finite fault, waveforms from a tele-station located 30-90 degrees are used. The far-field body wave equation is used and inverted by the Kikuchi-Kanamori algorithm. In addition to obtaining source parameters, this study also aims to determine the value of the rupture velocity that occurs during coseismic events. From this research was found that the rupture velocity (v(r)) was 2.5 km/s, which occurred at a depth of 13.7 km. The largest value of vector slip is 2.31 m, with an average slip value of 0.922 m. The dimension area of the fault has a size of 272 km x 110 km. The seismic moment obtained is 1.5 x 10(21) Nm, which is equivalent to Mw 8.1.

The method used was a qualitative method with data triangulation. This study involved 52 students in the 9th grade at one of Junior High Schools in West Bandung Regency and a teacher as a participant. The learning obstacle found in this study were an ontogenic obstacle, epistemological obstacle, and didactical obstacle. The ontogenic obstacle found was that students had difficulty in determining the names and elements of the prism, in which the difficulty was caused due to forgetfulness, doubt, and misconception of the prism surface area. The epistemological obstacle found was that students tended to memorize the definitions and formulas of the concept of the prism surface area, so they did not understand the concept as a whole. The didactical obstacle found was that the learning process was procedural and did not consider the difficulties and misunderstandings experienced by students while learning, as well as the lack of experience to construct geometric shape models, such as prisms.","[Aziiza, Y.

In this regard, the teaching of statistics is a fundamental aspect of the mathematics curriculum at any educational level. Therefore, this study presents a systematic literature review of 36 articles that examine statistical literacy skills among students. Specifically, this study focused on identifying teaching methods that influence the development of statistical literacy among students. It was found that four dominant factors influence the development of statistical literacy among students: the learning environment, students' attitude, teaching method, and students' basic knowledge. Some studies have focused on students' demographic factors, including their age, gender, and grade level; however, there are no conclusive findings on their role in influencing the development of statistical literacy. The study also revealed the three most common teaching methods in statistical literacy studies were teacher-centered teaching methods, student-centered teaching methods, and materials-based teaching. Out of these methods, materials-based teaching was the most commonly used to develop statistical literacy among students. Based on the findings, implications for teaching and learning statistics were discussed.","[Aziz, A.

The Tracker was applied to 10 institutions and the results show their ratings as a function of each sub-criteria and as an overarching rating.

These stimuli cause an unpleasant sensation lasting from seconds to minutes after provocation. Many alternative treatment methods have been introduced. One of the options is the use of low-level laser therapy, whose effect is based on the increase of the excitability threshold of the free nerve endings causing an analgesic effect, as well as on the stimulation of pulp mesenchymal cells to differentiate into odontoblasts and produce reparative dentin. To investigate the efficacy of low-level laser therapy in treating dentin hypersensitivity, we selected a group of patients complaining of sensitivity at the cervical area of teeth provoked by stimuli such as air, touch and cold spray. The patients were with good oral hygiene and with intact teeth or small non-carious cervical lesions. They confirmed the absence of serious systematic and psychological diseases; some of them smoked electronic cigarettes, which may aggravate the pain. The patients were submitted to six sessions of treatment of dentin hypersensitivity with intervals from 48 to 72 hours, as indicated by the manufacturer of the low-intensity laser device. The painful sensation was measured before each of the six sessions and immediately after the treatment. The results were evaluated by using a four-point scale. The answers assessment showed good results - there was a decrease of the pain sensation from 3-4 level to 1-2 level. Yet, we have to interpret this carefully, because pain evaluation is subjective and some of the smokers have quit smoking electronic cigarettes during the treatment. As a method of curing dentin hypersensitivity, the low-level laser therapy shows a good treatment efficacy, but needs further continuous follow-up.","[Balcheva, G.; Balcheva, M.; Panov, V; Madjova, C.] Med Univ Varna, Fac Dent Med, Dept Conservat Dent & Oral Pathol, 55 Marin Drinov Str, Varna 9000, Bulgaria","Balcheva, G (corresponding author), Med Univ Varna, Fac Dent Med, Dept Conservat Dent & Oral Pathol, 55 Marin Drinov Str, Varna 9000, Bulgaria.",dr.balcheva@gmail.com,,,Medical University of Varna [17016],"The study was supported and financed by the Medical University of Varna, Project No. 17016.",,21,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1859.0,,,,,,,,12035,10.1088/1742-6596/1859/1/012035,,4,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Quantum Science & Technology; Optics; Physics, Applied",Engineering; Physics; Optics,BS2DU,WOS:000700377600035,,gold,,,2022-07-14

A variety of therapeutic approaches have been applied - cognitive-behavioral therapy, different drugs and supplements, acupuncture, lasers - none of them has achieved a definitive solution of the problem. This leads to anxiety, altered pain perception, and, therefore, reduced quality of life of the affected patients. The aim of this study is to present low-level laser therapy as a pain control option in patients with burning mouth syndrome. We reveal the potential of a diode laser to reduce the unpleasant burning sensation. We also apply laser therapy on patients with primary burning mouth syndrome. The affected sites on the oral mucosa in the selected cases are various - tongue, lower lip, upper lip, palate, cheeks. They are irradiated 10 times (two or three times a week) by an infrared laser (lambda = 904 nm) and a red laser (lambda = 658 nm). The probe is kept in contact with the tissue and the mucosal surface is scanned during the irradiation. The burning intensity is evaluated through a visual analogue scale before and after the treatment. The low-level laser illumination decreases significantly and for a longer period the burning sensation. The low-level laser therapy is a valuable alternative for BMS treatment and can be combined with other treatment methods.","[Balcheva, M.; Balcheva, G.; Panov, V; Madjova, C.] Med Univ Varna, Fac Dent Med, Dept Conservat Dent & Oral Pathol, 55 Marin Drinov Str, Varna 9000, Bulgaria","Balcheva, M (corresponding author), Med Univ Varna, Fac Dent Med, Dept Conservat Dent & Oral Pathol, 55 Marin Drinov Str, Varna 9000, Bulgaria.",dr_balcheva@abv.bg,,,Medical University -Varna [17016],"The study was supported and financed by the Medical University -Varna, Project No 17016.",,17,0,0,2,2,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1859.0,,,,,,,,12036,10.1088/1742-6596/1859/1/012036,,5,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Quantum Science & Technology; Optics; Physics, Applied",Engineering; Physics; Optics,BS2DU,WOS:000700377600036,,gold,,,2022-07-14

The scaling rules potentially offer a shortcut for early design, showing how to tune the interior temperature and rate of buoyancy ventilation by adjusting the thickness and surface area of an internal thermal mass. A pair of test chambers (H similar to 1m), comparing wood and concrete internal thermal masses, were located in Alabama, USA and Montreal, Canada, and left outside in sun- and-wind-sheltered environments for consecutive months. The thermal mass thicknesses were optimized so the chambers would maintain similar interior temperatures and airflow rates.

For instance, the test chambers in Alabama were both designed to damp the maximum exterior temperature by a factor 1-1/Ai approximate to 0.7 and produce a maximum ventilation flow rate of Q approximate to 0.37 l/s.

The results of this deformation study include estimating the position of the hypocenter, the pressure source, and the magma supply volume, so that the volume of material released during the eruption can be estimated. With the Mogi Model approach to analysis the Tiltmeter data on the eruption of Merapi Volcano in 2016, the estimated hypocentre is at a depth of about 1,100 to 2,440 m and the depth of the pressure source is about 2,345 m below the peak of Merapi with a magma supply volume of 21.81 million m 3 . With the same model approach from GPS data on the 2010 eruption, the results show that the hypocentre is at a depth of about 1,100 to 2,500 m below the peak of Merapi The source of magma pressure is at 2,200 m below the peak of Merapi and the volume of magma supply before the eruption is 15 million m 3 .

This leads to reduced sensitivity and specificity due to the non-specific reactions with the molecules of the embedding matrix. Immobilization without embedding matrix (the so-called direct immobilization) guarantees the specificity of the biosensor and increases the sensitivity and accuracy. The main challenge in implementing this strategy is to preserve the bioactivity of the ligand.

Mathematical modeling of loading the horizontal borehole walls with a NX-borehole jack in a direction of principal components sigma(1) or sigma(3) of the natural stress field was performed for conditions of the unperturbed salt rock mass of the Verkhnekamskoe potassium salt deposit. As a result of the numerical calculation of stresses, it was determined that recovery of radial component sigma(r) in compression regions of the rock volume around the borehole occurs when the jack's pressure reaches the initial value of the principal stress. At the same time, the concentration of tangential component sigma(theta) in these regions is retained. The rock salt specimens were tested under modes similar to the stress states of the rocks in the around-borehole volume to study the Kaiser effect under these conditions using a triaxial compression vessel. It was found that in the second loading cycle, the recovery of the initial values of axial component sigma(axial) of the specimen stress field, unloaded after the first cycle, stimulates acoustic emission. This regularity is true for the case when there is no increase in confining pressure sigma(conf) on the specimen between the cycles. In the conditions with an increase in confining pressure sigma(conf) between the first and second cycles, the Kaiser effect is found at higher values of sigma(axial) component than the initial ones. It is shown that the nature of the effect depends on a type of a specimen's initial stress state and is caused by the growth resumption of longitudinal microcracks, if sigma(axial) > sigma(conf) in the first loading cycle, or by a closure of lateral microcracks when sigma(axial) < sigma(conf) in the first loading cycle.","[Beltyukov, N.

However, the technique can only rarely provide accurate estimates in vivo, as it requires that the light fluence at the voxels of interest is constant with wavelength. One way to extend the set of cases where accurate information related to sO(2) can be acquired with the technique is by taking the difference in sO(2) estimates between vessels. Assuming images are perfectly reconstructed, the intervascular difference in sO(2) estimates is accurate if the error in the estimates due to the wavelength dependence of the fluence is identical for both. An in silico study was performed to uncover what kinds of conditions may give rise to accurate sO(2) differences for a vessel pair. Basic criteria were formulated in simple tissue models consisting of a pair of vessels immersed in two-layer skin models. To assess whether these criteria might still be valid in more realistic imaging scenarios, the sO(2) difference was estimated for vessels in more complex tissue models.","[Bench, C.; Cox, B.] UCL, Dept Med Phys & Biomed Engn, London WC1E 6BT, England","Bench, C (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Med Phys & Biomed Engn, London WC1E 6BT, England.",ciaran.bench.17@ucl.ac.uk,,"Cox, Ben/0000-0001-7296-4093","BBSRC London Interdisciplinary Doctoral Programme, LIDo","The authors would like to thank Paul Beard and UCL's Photoacoustic Imaging Group for useful discussions.

Use of HTS in space and integration into small satellites requires careful consideration of the solar power availability and thermal management to maintain a cryogenic environment. This paper uses a modelling approach to investigate the power and thermal implications for an HTS magnet and cryocooler inside a 3U CubeSat which is tumbling uncontrollably in a 500 km circular orbit. We show that, under the assumptions of the model, attitude control is necessary to reach and maintain a cryogenic environment for the HTS magnet. As CubeSats are power starved due to their limited surface area for solar panels, even a slight net angular velocity approximately halves the power availability for the cryocooler to counteract the significant number of radiation sources in a low-Earth orbit. As such, this paper highlights the need for attitude control to achieve HTS in space. Additionally, we investigate scenarios which could cause a satellite to tumble, and discuss the possibility of using the interaction between the HTS magnet and Earth's magnetic field to de-tumble a satellite which has lost its attitude control.","[Berry, Thomas; Olatunji, Jamal R.; Acheson, Chris] Victoria Univ Wellington, Robinson Res Inst, Wellington, New Zealand","Berry, T (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Robinson Res Inst, Wellington, New Zealand.",thomas.berry@vuw.ac.nz; jamal.olatunji@vuw.ac.nz; chris.acheson@vuw.ac.nz,,"Olatunji, Jamal/0000-0002-2203-8873","New Zealand Ministryof Business, Innovation and Employment [RTVU1815]","Funded by the New Zealand Ministryof Business, Innovation and Employment under contract RTVU1815.",,38,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-9532-5,,,,2021.0,,,,,,,157,162,,10.1109/TENCON54134.2021.9707304,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BT1OC,WOS:000799485900029,,,,,2022-07-14

However, the damping factor of the EDS system is not enough. Once the oscillation of the bogie occurs by the external disturbance, it does not converge immediately. The additional damper system is needed, so the damper coil system is installed. By the semi-active damper system, the levitation stability is improved. This paper discusses about superconducting Maglev system as application of the EDS system. Superconducting Maglev has been the magnetic levitation system developed by Central Japan Railway Company and Railway Technical Research Institute. The operation speed of the train is v = 120[m/sec]. At low speed range such as v = 60-80[m/sec], the damping factor is smaller than that of the normal operation v = 120[m/sec], and it is difficult to keep the stable levitation. In this paper, running simulation when the bogie passes large displacement at low speed is undertaken, and the improved switching method for the semi-active damper system at low speed and large displacement is discussed. From the results, to increase the period that the damper coil works.

The magnetic dressing phenomenon occurs when spins precessing in a static field (holding field) are subjected to an additional strong alternating field. It is usually studied when such extra field is homogeneous and oscillates in one direction. We study the dynamics of spins under dressing condition in two unusual configurations. In the first instance, an inhomogeneous dressing field produces a space-dependent dressing phenomenon, which helps to operate the magnetometer in a strongly inhomogeneous static field. In the second instance, besides the usual configuration with a static and a strong orthogonal oscillating magnetic fields, we add a secondary oscillating field, which is perpendicular to both. The system shows novel and interesting features that are accurately explained and modelled theoretically. Possible applications of these novel features are briefly discussed.","[Bevilacqua, G.; Biancalana, V] Univ Siena, Dept Informat Engn & Math DIISM, Via Roma 56, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Dancheva, Y.] Univ Siena, Dept Phys Sci Earth & Environm DSFTA, Via Roma 56, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Dancheva, Y.] Aerosp Tecnol Rapolano T SI, Rapolano Terme, SI, Italy; [Vigilante, A.] UCL, Dept Phys & Astron, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England","Biancalana, V (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dept Informat Engn & Math DIISM, Via Roma 56, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",biancalana@unisi.it,"Giuseppe, Bevilacqua/F-8674-2011","Giuseppe, Bevilacqua/0000-0002-7298-6185",,,,18,0,0,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1859.0,,,,,,,,12018,10.1088/1742-6596/1859/1/012018,,8,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Quantum Science & Technology; Optics; Physics, Applied",Engineering; Physics; Optics,BS2DU,WOS:000700377600018,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-07-14

The processes of gene regulation determine the properties of these fields. Since the number of nucleotides usually is not large, a deterministic description of the field dynamics is insufficient. In this work, we consider a special kind of protein field, the dynamic behavior of which is described by the non-Markov process. Generally, the dynamics of complex organic compounds is time-dependent and spatially extended, and it may depend on all the previous evolution of the system. We consider a time-delayed repressilator as a model system. We study this system numerically using a modified Gillespie algorithm. New dynamic phenomena, which are visible only within a stochastic description, are reported. We show that synchronization in a gene expression occurs much faster due to the non-linear interaction of noise and delay. It results in almost regular oscillations even below the neutral curve derived within the deterministic analysis. We apply a hybrid approach to study the spatial dynamics of the repressilator proteins. This approach includes a deterministic calculation of the diffusion fluxes between cells and the stochastic simulation of gene regulation processes. We found that the combined action of time-delay, noise, and spatial signaling can lead to pattern formation even when the deterministic description predicts the absolute stability of the system.","[Bratsun, D.

In our experiments, optical transitions within the cesium D1 line are involved and a probe beam transmission is analyzed. The first spectroscopy method is based on the configuration with two-frequency counter propagating beams, which are linearly polarized in orthogonal directions. This configuration provides observation of high-contrast natural-linewidth resonances superimposed on broad Doppler profiles when the laser frequency is scanned. These resonances have good prospects for developing a miniature optical frequency reference. The second scheme involves two-frequency counter propagating beams with equal circular polarizations and provides observation of subnatural-linewidth resonances when the Raman frequency detuning is scanned. We use these resonances for stabilizing the microwave frequency of a local oscillator (approximate to 4.6 GHz). Frequency stability of around 6 x 10(-12) is achieved at 1-s averaging using a 5-mm length cell. This result makes the technique attractive for developing a miniature frequency standard in thr microwave range. The third configuration exploits single-frequency counter-propagating beams with linear orthogonal polarizations. The ultrahigh-contrast subnatural-linewidth resonances can be observed when the longitudinal magnetic field is scanned around zero. The possible application is discussed of these resonances in vector atomic magnetometry.","[Brazhnikov, D., V; Ignatovich, S. M.; Mesenzova, I. S.; Mikhailov, A. M.; Skvortsov, M. N.; Goncharov, A.

In addition, on some graphs that we use, we get rac(G) equal to rc(G), rainbow connection number. Instead, on the others, the value of rac(G) cannot reach the rc(G).","[Budi, H.

Petrochemical tank bottoms are particularly subject to corrosion. Today, the monitoring of corrosion in storage tanks is probably one of the most challenging applications of GWT because of the size and the complexity of such medium. This article deals with the main physical issues of this application, in particular, the prediction of the elastic field propagating in the tank wall and bottom, and the prediction of guided wave scattering by joints. Drawing on current research work, a representative numerical configuration is defined. The global diffusive effect and the local diffraction effect of the lap joints are studied. The methodology have led us to focus on the low ultrasound frequency range: from 10 to 50 kHz. A quantitative evaluation of the scattering by lap joint is carried out by means of simulations and experiments on elementary reduced scale joints. Dynamic range computations make it possible to get prior knowledge about the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required to get information about the tank bottom, for a given configuration, leading to a SNR-resolution trade-off. The method can be extended to larger tanks. The results confirm that the use of GWT technology for long-range active testing and imaging of storage tanks is promising.","[Cailly, William; Walaszek, Henri; Brzuchacz, Sebastien; Zhang, Fan] CETIM, Tech Ctr Mech Ind, Senlis, France; [Cailly, William; Lasaygues, Philippe] Aix Marseille Univ, LMA, Cent Marseille, CNRS, Marseille, France","Cailly, W (corresponding author), CETIM, Tech Ctr Mech Ind, Senlis, France.;Cailly, W (corresponding author), Aix Marseille Univ, LMA, Cent Marseille, CNRS, Marseille, France.",cailly@lma.cnrs-mrs.fr,,,National Association of Research and Technology (ANRT) [2017/07/90]; Technical Centre for Mechanical Industry (CETIM),"This work was funded by the National Association of Research and Technology (ANRT), project No. 2017/07/90, and the Technical Centre for Mechanical Industry (CETIM).",,13,0,0,0,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1761.0,,,,,,,,12008,10.1088/1742-6596/1761/1/012008,,22,"Acoustics; Physics, Applied",Acoustics; Physics,BR9PQ,WOS:000679396100008,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2022-07-14

The present paper aims to provide the wake structure produced by such a rotor for wind turbine and helicopter regimes. We use a filamentary approach, such that vortices are assumed to roll-up quickly to form thin vortex filaments of finite but small size and compute the induced velocity using a cut-off method. The structure of the wake is analyzed in the near- and far-fields separately. It is found to have a dual nature and to be well-described by a twisted vortex pair locally aligned along with a larger helical structure. The linear stability of the far-wake with respect to long-wave displacements is also analyzed. Two kinds of instability modes are obtained associated with a pairing between successive turns of the large helical structure and a pairing between successive turns of the vortex pair.","[Castillo-Castellanos, A.; Le Dizes, S.] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRPHE, Cent Marseille, 49 Rue Frederic Joliot Curie,BP146, F-13384 Marseille, France; [Duran Venegas, E.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Escuela Politecn Super, Dept Bioingn & Ingn Aerosp, Avda Univ, Leganes 3028911, Spain","Castillo-Castellanos, A (corresponding author), Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRPHE, Cent Marseille, 49 Rue Frederic Joliot Curie,BP146, F-13384 Marseille, France.",andres-alonso.castillo-castellanos@univ-amu.fr,,"Le Dizes, Stephane/0000-0001-6540-0433; Duran Venegas, Eduardo/0000-0002-4212-3004",Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-17-CE06-0018]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [391677260],"This work is part of the French-German project TWIN-HELIX, supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (grant no.

The WCPM method with negative feedback control has previously shown that it could help increase the trapped magnetic flux density, compared to conventional passive pulsed flux magnetization, if the magnetic field penetrates the bulk centre substantially using a flux jump. The flux jump sometimes greatly changes the magnetic and thermal state of the bulk, which limits the maximum trapped magnetic field. The active control method of the applied magnetic field helps to overcome this limit if the control conditions are appropriate. While searching for the ideal control conditions of the WCPM, the magnetization characteristics have been investigated. We found that the flux jump, which assists the flux in penetrating the centre of the bulk, can be slowed down thanks to the negative-feedback WCPM. This operation helped to decrease the heat generated by the moving flux inside the bulk and reduced the temperature rise, which contributed to the increase of the trapped magnetic flux density.","[Caunes, A.

In this paper, the practice of modeling this effect after linear superposition of single turbine inductions, calculated with three of the most recent analytic models, is compared to Large-Eddy-Simulations of idealized wind farms. We compare the models across two different farms, composed of 9 and 49 turbines, with two different heights of the atmospheric boundary layer, 300 and 500 m. The results show that the differences between the analytical models are negligible while they substantially differ from the LES results. The linear superposition of induction consistently underestimates the upstream velocity deficit with an error that increases as the wind farm size grows and the ABL height decreases. Also when calculating the power output at the turbines of the farm, the analytical models considered do not agree well with the LES. These comparisons reveal that the farm interactions with the atmospheric boundary layer may highly outclass the turbine induction in determining the extent of the global blockage effect. Therefore, we present a first dimensional approach to the problem based on LES, aimed at simplifying its characterization.","[Centurelli, G.; Schroeder, M.; Lukassen, L.

All estimated parameters were analyzed by apply The Maximum Curvature (MAXC) method. This method is a fast and straightforward way to estimating Mc and consists in determining the point of the maximum curvature by calculating the maximum value of the first derivative of the Frequency-Magnitude distribution (FMD) curve. In practice, this matches the magnitude bin with the highest occurrence frequency of events in the cumulative and non-cumulative of FMD. The value of the magnitude of completeness, which was evaluated on the frequency-magnitude distribution, was found range from Mc 3.4 to 4.0. Then, b-value (0.73 to 0.82 +/- 0.02) and a-value 5.560 to 6.312 was obtained for the area Wongsorejo and the Montong faults in East Java and which is characterized by more heterogeneous crustal structure. The areas that have low b-value indicated as the area with a high seismic moment release and high stress accumulation. Low b-value areas are located mainly along the Java Trench. Seismicity of East Java is a result of the combined impacts of complex tectonic features. Understanding and clarifying the mechanisms of these tectonic features in relation to Mc, b-value and a-value can help us to better assess seismic risk in subduction zones.","[Chasanah, U.] Univ Muhammadiyah Lamongan, Prodi S1 Fis Fak Sains & Teknol, Kabupaten Lamongan, Jawa Timur, Indonesia; [Handoyo, E.] Univ Muhammadiyah Lamongan, Prodi S1 Tekn Komputer Fak Sains & Teknol, Kabupaten Lamongan, Jawa Timur, Indonesia","Chasanah, U (corresponding author), Univ Muhammadiyah Lamongan, Prodi S1 Fis Fak Sains & Teknol, Kabupaten Lamongan, Jawa Timur, Indonesia.",chasanah.us23@umla.ac.id,,,,,,16,0,0,1,2,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1805.0,,,,,,,,12009,10.1088/1742-6596/1805/1/012009,,9,"Physics, Multidisciplinary",Physics,BR6XL,WOS:000664519500009,,gold,,,2022-07-14

Due to its limited collateral effects, this minimally invasive therapy is, in its field of application, an alternative to surgical treatments and is rapidly expanding in terms of both clinical research and industrial development. In this context, the use of simulation is a crucial element to reduce both the development time and prototype costs, as well as the number of preclinical and clinical experiments. To this aim, CEA-LIST has been developing the simulation platform, CIVA HealthCare in partnership with INSERM for several years, which uses optimized and validated modules for the simulation of a whole HIFU therapy protocol. However, multi-parametric studies for treatment optimisation (probe design, protocol definition, etc.), sensitivity analysis, and tissue characterisation are very time-consuming, since they involve many simulations. We propose an alternative solution of replacing the computationally expensive direct solver with a surrogate model built from a database of simulation results. The procedure breaks down into two stages First, the database is adaptively constructed to maximise the fidelity of the associated interpolator computed from the pairs (Input/Output) of the database. Then in the second step, the interpolator, also called surrogate model or metamodel, enables the generation of results in near real time for configurations covered by the range of the database. This procedure and its related tools have been implemented in CIVA-HealthCare. To highlight the potential offered by such intensive HIFU simulation based on surrogate models strategy, two applications are presented: The first concerns real-time pressure field computation, and the second is based on thermal simulations and deals with sensitivity analyses according to uncertainties in tissues parameters.

A comparison of the deformation behavior of human dentin with the several polymer based dental composites under compression and bending was performed. It was shown that the deformation behavior of some highly filled composites was close to human dentin in the elastic regime whereas they cannot be deformed plastically under compression. Low filled composites possess higher plasticity, but a lower Young's modulus than dentin under compression. Mechanical properties of a highly filled composite (similar to 60%, by volume) with smaller size of fillers are closer to the properties of human dentin under bending whereas other tested dental materials have a lower Young's modulus and flexural strength in comparison with dentin. Therefore, we concluded that it was impossible to achieve complete combination of the mechanical properties of human dentin such as high elasticity and plasticity at high strength by means of varying the amount and size of solid filler in polymer matrix. Self-similar hierarchical mechanics model can be used for describing of the deformation behavior of human dentin in elastic regime and one level is sufficient for these calculations.","[Cheboksartseva, M.

It is assumed that the use of such particles in the production of coatings by cold gas-dynamic spraying will increase the deposition efficiency and the weight fraction of boron carbide in the coating. An increase in the concentration of carbide particles in the processed powder mixture, under all other conditions being equal, leads to a decrease in the average volume size of the particles. It is noted that in this case, the boron carbide particles behave as a surfactant.

In this work, photoluminescent materials are investigated as possible light sources to be implemented in urban lighting systems, focusing on the free-cost and renewable luminous gain they provide after being exposed to a proper radiation. In particular, commercially available photoluminescent powders are evaluated by means of spectroradiometric techniques and using a specifically designed experimental setup. Measurements are repeated for different intensities and wavebands of irradiation to identify the most promising pigment-lamp combination in terms of (i) luminous intensity and (ii) photoluminescence duration. Results show that the shorter the distance between the emission spectra of the exciting source and the photoluminescent powder, the better the performance of the latter. Therefore, the choice of both afterglow and exciting source cannot be independent from the final system's application and the required end-use lighting level.","[Chiatti, C.; Fabiani, C.; Pisello, A.

One major challenge deals with the implementation of high self-consumption (SC) schemes for the energy produced on site, essential to carry on a wider implementation of photovoltaic systems. The present paper addresses the effect of different sizing strategies on the SC levels of 3 systems installed on traditional and nZEB houses, with a peak power between 3.12 kWp and 5.98 kWp. The systems have been monitored recording the various energy flows involved. Different optimization strategies have been tested with the purpose of minimizing the interaction with the grid, according to SC and self-sufficiency (SS) indexes. The aim is to provide design guidelines for the correct sizing in a bottom-up approach. Results underlined the fundamental role of storage technologies. Approximately 6 Wp/m(2) assure an optimal energy employment without storage, with SS index below 35%: the integration of small storage, 3-7 kWh/kWp leads to SS and SC index above 60% and 88% respectively.","[Cillari, Giacomo; Fantozzi, Fabio; Franco, Alessandro] Univ Pisa, Dept Energy Syst Terr & Construct Engn, I-56126 Pisa, Italy","Cillari, G (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Energy Syst Terr & Construct Engn, I-56126 Pisa, Italy.",giacomo.cillari@phd.unipi.it,,"Fantozzi, Fabio/0000-0002-3213-1764",,,,11,0,0,3,3,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12088,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012088,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100088,,gold,,,2022-07-14

To exclude the uncertainties related to the blade loads computation, the loads of a corresponding blade-resolving simulation are imposed. Three force projection functions are applied, which all radially scale with the local chord length: an isotropic Gauss force distribution, an anisotropic Gauss distribution with distinct projection widths in the chord and thickness directions, and a Gauss-Gumbel projection function which creates an airfoil-like force distribution in the chord direction. Comparisons with corresponding blade-resolving simulations and experimental results show a good agreement of the tip vortex core size, position and circulation. Comparison of the mid-wake instantaneous streamwise velocity with blade-resolving simulations shows a thinner vortex sheet and stronger effects of the trailed vortices in the actuator line simulation. Although the bound vortex shape scales with the projection function, no significant difference was observed in the resulting tip vortices and near-wake flow field between the three projection functions used. It is attributed to the similar projection width in the tip vortex region for all cases considered. With the chosen grid refinement in the tip vortex area and a smearing width that scales with the chord length, tip vortices that compare with high-resolution experiments and high-fidelity blade-resolving simulation could be generated with the actuator line approach.","[Cormier, Marion; Weihing, Pascal; Lutz, Thorsten] Univ Stuttgart, Fac Aerosp Engn & Geodesy, Inst Aerodynam & Gas Dynam, Pfaffenwaldring 21, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany","Cormier, M (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Fac Aerosp Engn & Geodesy, Inst Aerodynam & Gas Dynam, Pfaffenwaldring 21, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",cormier@iag.uni-stuttgart.de; lutz@iag.uni-stuttgart.de,,,,,,21,0,0,4,5,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1934.0,,,,,,,,12013,10.1088/1742-6596/1934/1/012013,,10,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Mechanical; Mechanics; Physics, Fluids & Plasmas",Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Mechanics; Physics,BS3JN,WOS:000712011500013,,gold,,,2022-07-14

For that purpose, dynamic simulation can reduce the performance gap between simulated and actual performance, however, multiple issues are involved. In the EU Directives, the nZEB framework addresses the operational consumption, which traditionally was the main portion in the building life cycle. However, where nZEB is concerned, the running energy is strongly reduced and embedded energy and disposal assume a higher contribution to the energy life cycle cost. It is worthy to note that LC-ZEBs (Life Cycle Zero Energy Buildings) have been conceptualized more than 10 years ago and the LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) approach is now integrated into the most advanced CVEs (Calculation Virtual Environments) to enable a broader evaluation of building energy during the lifespan.

A tool for simulating them is under development to help designing optimal MPT for a given application. It requires the prior accurate modelling of transduction phenomena involved in such patches and of the GW fields they generate. A MPT is made of a thin magnetostrictive strip under a static magnetic field, glued to the waveguide under examination and excited by an alternative current circulating in a coil. In the strip where they take place, transduction phenomena are similar to those generated by an electro-magnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) in a ferromagnetic medium. They involve magnetostrictive strain, magnetization force and surface traction and Lorentz force (Clausse et al. 2017 J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 797 102004), which can be transformed into equivalent surface stresses at the outer surface of the strip. A matrix model is developed to propagate the equivalent stresses from this outer surface to that of the waveguide. Once equivalent stress distributions are computed at this latter surface, a model (Barras et al. 2020 Ultrasonics 103 1060782) is used to predict the MPT radiation into the waveguide. Overall, the chaining of these models constitutes a semi-analytical multi-physics model for GW radiation by MPT of high computing efficiency.","[Cousin, G.; Lhemery, A.] Univ Paris Saclay, CEA LIST, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Cousin, G.; Grondel, S.] UPHF, F-59313 Valenciennes, France","Lhemery, A (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, CEA LIST, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France.",alain.lhemery@cea.fr,,,,,,13,0,0,1,3,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1761.0,,,,,,,,12005,10.1088/1742-6596/1761/1/012005,,18,"Acoustics; Physics, Applied",Acoustics; Physics,BR9PQ,WOS:000679396100005,,gold,,,2022-07-14

However, many types of research have proven the usefulness of the scale models to evaluate daylighting system performances in buildings. Several scales of a physical model have been used varying between (1:50) and real scale (1:1), and no comparative study has been done to evaluate the effect of the model size in daylighting assessment. The objective of this investigation is to make a comparison between two different scales of a physical model: the first one is a model with a scale of (1:12) while the second is with the scale of (1: 4), aiming to study the scale effects on daylight perception with models equipped with a daylighting system under very high exterior illuminance levels. The methodology of this study consists in collecting simultaneously the measurement of the exterior and interior illuminance level (lux) and subjective evaluations from a questionnaire survey with the two scale models (1:4 and 1:12) under real sky conditions. A correlation between collected data has been explored. Comparing the measurement results, it is obvious that the quantity of light that penetrates the test models (1:4 and 1:12) was the same. The results are with a range of +/- 1.6%. Moreover, survey results show that the participants' perceptions regarding satisfaction, light distribution and glare questions differ with the scale of the physical 3D model. The subjects felt more satisfied with the luminous atmosphere with the physical model of (1:4) compared with the model of (1:12).","[Daich, Safa; Saadi, Mohamed Yacine] Biskra Univ, Dept Architecture, LACOMOFA Lab, Biskra, Algeria; [Piga, Barbara E.

Particular attention is given to selecting a momentum conserving wake summation method, because of its critical role in coupling the influence of individual wakes. Results are presented to illustrate the influence that wake summation methods have on equilibrium velocity and power production in a row of turbines, for different inter-turbine spacing and inflow velocities.

BEEP works with building industry, policy makers, and building owners to catalyse adoption of EETC building design and technologies. India wants to avoid or reduce the use of air conditioning by improving natural ventilation at night, which requires numerical simulations to compute the flow around the buildings. However, the simulations of fluid flows are time consuming and are not used at the beginning of a project when the locations of the buildings are set. To improve the situation, a freely distributable environment based on the OpenFOAM toolbox has been developed providing two levels of resolution: an approximate level computing the flow in few minutes and a RANS level of simulation. The user inputs are limited to the geometry and the velocity direction and magnitude. The mesh and the numerical set up are automated.

The calculations are fulfilled on the base of interfacial hydrodynamics equations by using mathematical package Comsol Multiphysics. It is shown that the effect of a radial flow symmetry breakdown appears as a result of convective instability, so that the initial poloidal rotation of the liquid transforms into the azimuthal plane. The system of inclined steady volumetric vortices is formed under the film of surfactant. The inclination angle of the plane of rotation in dependence on the intensity of radial thermocapillary flow is studied. It is shown that the azimuthal vorticity can be regulated by the power of point-heat source and by free surface area. The increase of heating intensity leads to the growth of the azimuthal vorticity. Thus, the initially radially symmetric toroidal flow is divided into two parts with the origination of vortices in the azimuthal plane under the film.","[Demin, V.

Using our theoretical approach for analysis of IWS, simulations and test experiments, we show that such optimized splitters ensure a smooth splitting in an increased linear variation range of the transmission T (from similar to 80 - 95% to 5%) and reflection (R = 1 - T), in combination with a large working range (linear splitting by sliding to more than similar to 15 - 20 mm). The low slope of the transmission variation permits one to split beams of diameter 3 - 5 mm; focusing the beam increases this range to more than similar to 15 mm. The control is performed by sliding the splitter in its plane (dimensions similar to 5x2x0.1 cm(3)) thus conserving the direction of the formed beams. No specific polarization is required and the use is possible of high-power laser beams. A suitable practical realization is the use of a mask technology for sequential deposition of necessary layers in integrated circuits.","[Deneva, M.; Nenchev, M.] Tech Univ Sofia, Quantum & Optoelect Lab, R&D Div, Plovdiv Branch, 25 Tsanko Dyustabanov Str, Plovdiv 4000, Bulgaria","Deneva, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Sofia, Quantum & Optoelect Lab, R&D Div, Plovdiv Branch, 25 Tsanko Dyustabanov Str, Plovdiv 4000, Bulgaria.",deneva@tu-plovdiv.bg,"Deneva, Margarita/AAE-5002-2022",,Bulgarian National Science Fund [DN 17/7],The work is supported by Bulgarian National Science Fund under project/ DN 17/7 (2017).,,7,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1859.0,,,,,,,,12020,10.1088/1742-6596/1859/1/012020,,6,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Quantum Science & Technology; Optics; Physics, Applied",Engineering; Physics; Optics,BS2DU,WOS:000700377600020,,gold,,,2022-07-14

To elucidate the influence of these unaccounted factors as well as that of initial deformation of the droplet, we experimentally studied the evolution of the shape of large-diameter droplets in the solution with density stratification. The droplet behaviour was studied in the case when it took the form of a spheroid flattened vertically under the action of gravity. The interferometer was used to visualize the distribution of solution concentration near the drop. The dependence of the ratio of the vertical to horizontal diameter of the droplet on time and the average concentration gradient in the surrounding medium was determined.","[Denisova, M.

Relative frequency and rate of change of blind use were analysed in terms of window orientation, occupancy level, and the time of the day. Logistic regression and data mining techniques were used to identify potentially useful and understandable occupant behaviour patterns and reveal the main triggers behind blind adjustments. The well-designed automation system together with the inner glare protection formed the base of very low user-shade interactions. A mean of 0.184 manual blind adjustments per day per office. Eight regression sub-models were developed and all were incapable of predicting user-shade lowering and raising events. Alternatively, two user profiles were mined based on 20 rules gained from clustering analysis: user (beta) was representing the passive user, and user (mu) the medium user.

From this phenomenon, researchers conducted research that aims to determine the attention or awareness of physics students on the earthquake phenomenon on 5-7 July 2020, to find out students 'knowledge about the Earthquake Disaster and to find out physics students' understanding of the Causes of Earthquakes on 5-7 July 2020. This research used the questionnaire method and interview. The respondents in this research were 62 physics students at the State University of Surabaya. The results showed that the dominant response was 61.3% or as many as 38 physics students knew about the earthquake but paid less attention. Meanwhile, physics students 'understanding of the Earthquake Disaster was included in the intelligible category, and physics students' understanding of the Causes of the Earthquake on July 7, 2020, obtained the most dominant results, 29% answered that it was caused by the subduction activity of the Indo-Austrian plate.

In this work, we show that it is possible to learn control policies on simple black-box linear room temperature models, thereby alleviating the heavy engineering usually required to build accurate surrogates. We develop a black-box pipeline, where historical data is taken as input to produce room temperature control policies. The trained DRL agents are capable of beating industrial rule-based controllers both in terms of energy consumption and comfort satisfaction, using novel penalties to introduce expert knowledge, i.e. to incentivize agents to follow expected behaviors, in the reward function. Moreover, one of the best agents was deployed on a real building for one week and was able to save energy while maintaining adequate comfort levels, indicating that low-complexity models might be enough to learn control policies that perform well on real buildings.","[Di Natale, L.; Svetozarevic, B.; Heer, P.] Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol Empa, Urban Energy Syst Lab, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Di Natale, L.; Jones, C.

This study aims to determine the difficulties faced by Indonesian mathematics and science teachers in implementing STEM in recent five years. Based on seven main articles compared in this study, the difficulties faced by teachers in implementing STEM or STEAM are varied depending on its main focus (mathematics or science). The most common obstacle faced by mathematics teachers are finding real-life contexts of abstract topic in mathematics. While, the main difficulty experienced by science teachers are insufficient comprehension toward STEM and the limitation of time. Moreover, both mathematics and science teachers shared common difficulties as follows: low understanding about STEM, the lack of facilities and limited time provided in learning schedule. Therefore, to overcome teachers' difficulties mentioned before, several solutions are offered depends on the needs such as increasing teachers' comprehension toward STEM, completing school facilities and adjusting curriculum targets under the implementation of STEM.","[Diana, N.; Yohannes] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Sekolah Pascasarjana, Program Studi Pendidikan Matemat, Jl Dr Setiabudi 229, Bandung 40154, Indonesia; [Turmudi] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Dept Pendidikan Matemat, Sekolah Pascasarjana, Jl Dr Setiabudi 229, Bandung 40154, Indonesia","Diana, N (corresponding author), Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Sekolah Pascasarjana, Program Studi Pendidikan Matemat, Jl Dr Setiabudi 229, Bandung 40154, Indonesia.",nanadiana@upi.edu,,"Yohannes, Yohannes/0000-0001-7094-5024; Diana, Nana/0000-0002-2675-7445",LPDP (Lembaga Pengelola Dana PendidikanIndonesia Endowment Fund for Education),The author would like to express gratitude to UPI (Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia-Indonesia University of Education) for academic support and to LPDP (Lembaga Pengelola Dana PendidikanIndonesia Endowment Fund for Education) for financial support in this study.,,41,0,0,6,11,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1806.0,,,,,,,,12219,10.1088/1742-6596/1806/1/012219,,7,"Education, Scientific Disciplines",Education & Educational Research,BR6UL,WOS:000664182600218,,gold,,,2022-07-14

This method represents an evolution of the classical state-space substructuring method (classical SSS). Likewise the well-known Lagrange Multiplier Frequency Based Substructuring (LM FBS) method, the LM-SSS is achieved by using a dual assembly formulation, which means that the full set of degrees of freedom (DOFs) is retained. The equilibrium and compatibility conditions are established by directly considering the connecting forces. The LM-SSS method has demonstrated to be simple to understand and to implement in a computational environment. Furthermore, since the formulation uses a mapping matrix to enforce the coupling conditions, several substructures can be coupled at same time. Similar to classical SSS, this method is not able to directly compute a minimal-order coupled state-space model. However, two post-processing procedures are presented in order to compute a minimal realization of the obtained coupled state-space models by using these techniques. By coupling numerical data is found that when dealing with state-space models estimated from noise-free data the same solutions are obtained by using the classical SSS or the LM-SSS. However, by comparing both methods is clear that the LM-SSS may have advantages over the classical method when dealing with state-space models estimated from experimental data, since it requires the inversion of only one matrix, thus reducing the instability of the associated numerical problems.","[Dias, R.

For this analysis, a pair of real scale WTs located on a site with moderately complex terrain and heterogeneous forest is simulated using Large Eddy Simulation (LES). This simulation is compared with met mast and power output measurements of two WTs in Ryningsnas, Sweden, considering near neutral stratification in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Three validation steps are followed; first, the undisturbed wind profile is compared with met mast data and another similar LES code. Then, the wake for each WT wake impacting on the met mast at different directions is addressed. A feature of this pair of WTs is that these have different hub heights, but the same rated power and rotor diameter, which helps provide insight into how the tip clearance over the forest affects the operation and wake characteristics. Finally, power output deficits when the WTs are operating in each others wakes are compared to observed power deficits. For these simulations SOWFA, the OpenFOAM project for wind farms simulation in ABL, is used. In this code, three new additions are made; the forest model, the mesh modification for complex terrain and the representation of the WT using an actuator disc model with local force adaptation for wind farm flows. The simulation results show a good performance on quantitatively and qualitatively capturing the velocity in the wake, but for TKE the simulation underestimates the magnitude, and fails to match the measured structure of the wake for one of two WTs. The power deficit on the impacted WTs is well captured, despite the complexity related to turbines with different hub heights. This study makes one of the first steps on validating LES simulations for wind farms in forest.","[Diaz, Gonzalo P.

Optical amplification could enhance the performance of these on-chip LDVs, but the intrinsic noise of optical amplifiers could be detrimental for the limit of detection (LOD) of the displacement of the LDV. Recent developments in heterogeneous integration of semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) on the silicon-on-insulator platform allow for compact and relatively cheap development of on-chip LDVs with SOAs. In this paper, we study the influence of an SOA on the LOD of an on-chip homodyne laser doppler vibrometer. We describe the influence of the shot noise and SOA-noise on the LOD of the vibrometer. SOA intrinsic phase noise depends on the optical power in the SOA, causing the position of the SOA to have a large influence on the performance. From the analysis, it is shown that SOAs can improve the performance of an homodyne LDV when there are large losses in the measurement arm. These losses occur due to the coupling of light from the chip towards the target and back into the on-chip waveguides.","[Dieussaert, Emiel; Li, Yanlu; Morthier, Geert; Baets, Roel] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium; [Dieussaert, Emiel; Li, Yanlu; Morthier, Geert; Baets, Roel] IMEC, Photon Res Grp, Dept Informat Technol, Ghent, Belgium; [Dieussaert, Emiel; Li, Yanlu; Morthier, Geert; Baets, Roel] Univ Ghent, Ctr Nano & Biophoton, Ghent, Belgium","Dieussaert, E (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.;Dieussaert, E (corresponding author), IMEC, Photon Res Grp, Dept Informat Technol, Ghent, Belgium.;Dieussaert, E (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Ctr Nano & Biophoton, Ghent, Belgium.",Emiel.Dieussaert@UGent.be,"Dieussaert, Emiel/ABF-8825-2021","Dieussaert, Emiel/0000-0003-2732-7751",,,,10,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2041.0,,,,,,,,12005,10.1088/1742-6596/2041/1/012005,,8,"Mechanics; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing; Optics; Physics, Applied",Mechanics; Materials Science; Optics; Physics,BS4XT,WOS:000723958200005,,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-07-14

The surfaces of disk-shaped samples were treated by a commercial picosecond laser with a power of 0.2 W, 0.5 W and 1 W and a number of pulses between 1,000 and 20,000. The samples' surface was investigated by SEM and a non-contact 3D surface profiler. The technological parameters were optimized by regression analysis using the QStatLab software. It was found that after laser treatment with the lowest values of the above parameters only the surface roughness changed in the case of cp-Ti, while its Ti6Al4V counterpart had a melted zone with a 5.5- mu m depth. Raising the values of the regime parameters mainly led to an increased cavity depth on the cp-Ti surface, while those on Ti6Al4V increased in all dimensions. The surface roughness of both materials was higher after the laser treatment and grew bigger as the laser power and the number of pulses were increased. The optimal technological parameters for treatment of cp-Ti and Ti6Al4V were found. The results obtained can be used for picosecond laser texturing of titanium surfaces using linear or dimple types of patterns.","[Dikova, T.

The optimal de-rating level of each individual turbine is determined by using accurate and computationally efficient surrogate models, mapping the dependency between the choice of de-rating strategy for a given turbine and the load and power outputs of downwind turbines. A case study based on the Lillgrund offshore wind farm shows that for specific wind directions with strong wake interactions, it may be possible to achieve a net gain in power output in the order of 5% at specific mean wind speeds. Alternatively, maintaining nominal power output but optimizing the load distribution could lead to substantial fatigue load reductions.","[Dimitrov, Nikolay; Natarajan, Anand] DTU Wind Energy, Roskilde, Denmark","Dimitrov, N (corresponding author), DTU Wind Energy, Roskilde, Denmark.",nkdi@dtu.dk,"Dimitrov, Nikolay/B-7278-2015; Natarajan, Anand/C-5517-2011","Dimitrov, Nikolay/0000-0003-1325-4512; Natarajan, Anand/0000-0001-6850-0798",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [727680],This work is part of the TotalControl project funded by European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 727680.

The flux modulation machine is an unconventional topology where the inductor is composed by a large static superconducting coil and rotating superconducting bulks acting as magnetic field shields. This topology allows controlling the inductor excitation while being brushless.

Three wind speed scenarios are considered: below, at, and above rated operation. The inflow is generated with the Mann model and the wake and loads are simulated with FAST.Farm. As the upstream rotor tilt goes from 0 degrees to 6 degrees, we find that the mean wake is displaced upward by more than 0.2 rotor diameters (D) by a downstream distance of 7 D. The vertical velocities increase by up to 35 cm/s in the center of the wake. As a result, the downstream rotor is partially waked and experiences a rotated velocity vector. With a higher upstream rotor tilt, the velocities and moments on the downstream turbine increase their mean axial value and their lateral and vertical standard deviation. These changes affect the blade and tower loading and the floater motion primarily in the out-of-plane direction: the damage-equivalent loads for the tower pitch moment and blade-root moment increase by up to 10% because of higher variability at the first mode for the tower and at one blade passing frequency for the blade root. Lesser effects are observed for the roll moments and for floater sway and heave. When the joint effect of rotor tilt and platform motion is considered, the load response on the downstream system is amplified primarily for tower pitch and blade out-of-plane moment.","[Doubrawa, P.; Sirnivas, S.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab NREL, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Godvik, M.] Equinor, Sandsliveien 90, Bergen, Norway","Doubrawa, P (corresponding author), Natl Renewable Energy Lab NREL, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",paula.doubrawa@nrel.gov,,,National Renewable Energy Laboratory; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC36-08GO28308]; U.S. Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Wind Energy Technologies Office,"This work was authored [in part] by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, operated by Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC, for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

A design is thereby evaluated through its reliability by taking uncertainties into account. The influence of uncertainties emerging specifically within the fatigue limit state can be essential on a structure's reliability. For that reason, this study investigates two different sources for uncertainties within probabilistic fatigue design. The influence of a reduced approach, where the random behavior of a structural failure is only represented through an uncertain critical Miner sum, is compared to an approach, where also the S-N curve is subjected to uncertainties. For this, an offshore wind turbine with monopile support structure is investigated. The reliability analysis is performed through crude Monte Carlo simulations which utilize a Gaussian Process regression model in order to determine the wind turbine's structural response. The results show that both sources of uncertainties, the critical Miner sum and the S-N curve, contribute differently to the overall reliability. Uncertainties of the critical Miner sum have a rather small influence, whereas the implementation of an uncertain S-N curve leads to a noticeable increase of the reliability.","[Drexler, Sebastian; Muskulus, Michael] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Trondheim, Norway","Drexler, S (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Trondheim, Norway.",sebastian.drexler@ntnu.no,,,,,,29,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2018.0,,,,,,,,12014,10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/012014,,12,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Mechanical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BS3LW,WOS:000713005900014,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-07-14

This type of models are nevertheless still uncommon, drastically limiting options to perform these comparisons accurately. To address this challenge, an open-source tool to model district heating networks is presented here and successfully applied to two case studies in western Switzerland.

Due to its non-contact, high accuracy, and resolution, the laser Doppler method has become one of the most commonly used vibration measurement techniques. However, one of the main problems in high-temperature vibration measurement is that the surface of the measured objects is oxidized, thus resulting in a decrease of interference signal intensity and signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, the aforementioned may even cause measurement failure. In this paper, an all-fiber laser Doppler velocity measurement device using a fiber optic circulator is established. Its vibration measurement performance is experimentally validated at high temperatures. The results demonstrate that this device can achieve vibration measurement within the temperature range of 300 degrees C-1200 degrees C with a maximum vibration speed of 1 m/s and maximum vibration acceleration of 378.4 m/s(2). Relative deviation with Polytec vibrometer's velocity results is within 1.95%.

Furthermore, the methodology is transferred to a component-specific level, namely generator windings, in order to evaluate the general suitability for non-mechanical load exposures.

The rotor consists of a single untwisted rectangular blade and is tested with various pitch angles at different rotation speeds and free stream velocities. Flapwise blade deformations are measured using image processing, and flow fields are obtained by Particle Image Velocimetry. The blade exhibits extreme downstream and upstream bending at high negative and positive pitch angles, respectively. In addition, for negative pitch angles, unsteady flapwise fluctuations are observed, accompanied by large-scale recirculation zones. These zones are formed and shed periodically behind the rotor, resembling the dynamics of the Vortex Ring State known for helicopters in steep descent. The induced axial velocity near the blade tip changes direction from upstream to downstream, in accordance with the bending direction, reaching values that exceed twice the free-stream velocity in extreme bending conditions. The blade deformation has a strong dependence on the tip speed ratio for low pitch angles, and a more pronounced dependence on the tip Reynolds number for high pitch angles. Results for a two-bladed rotor are also shown and compared to the behaviour observed for a single blade.","[Eldemerdash, A.

A significant challenge in acquiring all this information is in managing the volume of data captured (in excess of 1TB a day). This paper presents results from an investigation into an approach to adapt the way the data is acquired and stored, whilst not inherently biasing the process. The approach combines a range of traditional techniques, as well as a simplified implementation of the already well established sparse sampling technique. This approach is applied to the collection of data from a windfarm export cable over a period of 876 hours.

The research outcomes show that the building's form, height, density, and orientation change consistently the pedestrian comfort around the buildings. The findings suggest that the integrated analysis of different building morphologies, massing, orientation, and their influences on the surrounding microclimate, thermal, and wind comfort are important.","[Eslamirad, Nasim; De Luca, Francesco; Lylykangas, Kimmo Sakari] Tallinn Univ Technol, City Ctr Excellence Finest Twins, Tallinn, Estonia","Eslamirad, N (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ Technol, City Ctr Excellence Finest Twins, Tallinn, Estonia.",nasim.eslamirad@taltech.ee,,,European Commission through the H2020 project Finest Twins [856602],This work has been supported by the European Commission through the H2020 project Finest Twins (grant No. 856602).,,21,1,1,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12053,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012053,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100053,,gold,,,2022-07-14

It is shown that the relative double-scattering component of the LIDAR return may be approximately considered as a sum of the independent relative contributions of each of the atmospheric components. Then, using appropriate models, the contribution of each component of interest is evaluated as a function of the altitude, taking into account the scattering properties of the medium under consideration, the angular divergence and the wavelength of the sensing laser beam, and the angle of view of the receiving optical system.

In order to unveil the dependence of the radiant field on the features of the urban fabrics, this study analyses the space distribution of the Mean Radiant Temperature (TMRT) and the radiant field in various urban tissues of the city of Catania (Italy) in a typical Mediterranean climate. The study is based on simulations through the Solar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry model (SOLWEIG) implemented in UMEP. Results show that the worst conditions occur in areas with moderately deep urban canyons, abundant impervious surfaces and lack of vegetation: here, the TMRT can easily reach 78 degrees C while in more than 80% of the area it exceeds 60 degrees C. By modelling the time trends of the shortwave and longwave radiant heat fluxes perceived by a pedestrian, it has been possible to observe that the highest contribution to the outdoor radiant field comes from the downward solar irradiance. However, the downward and upward longwave radiant flux closely follows: this suggests the importance of providing shading rather than using highly reflective surfaces that can exacerbate heat stress by means of the increased reflected shortwave radiation.","[Evola, G.; Marletta, L.; Urso, A.] Univ Catania, Dept Elect Elect & Comp Engn DIEEI, Viale A Doria 6, I-95125 Catania, Italy; [Costanzo, V; Nocera, F.; Detommaso, M.] Univ Catania, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture DICAr, Via S Sofia 64, I-95123 Catania, Italy","Evola, G (corresponding author), Univ Catania, Dept Elect Elect & Comp Engn DIEEI, Viale A Doria 6, I-95125 Catania, Italy.",,,,,,,17,0,0,4,4,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12046,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012046,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100046,,gold,,,2022-07-14

The process of bubble formation and drift was recorded using a highspeed camera in the plane of the cuvette illuminated by a laser knife. It is shown that the addition of a surfactant to an aqueous solution of NaCl salt leads to a partial inhibition of the coalescence of the observed bubbles and a change in the degassing mode of the liquid in the presence of ultrasonic treatment. The maximum activity of cavitation processes and the formation of vapor-gas bubbles was observed in the presence of salt and a low concentration of SDS. Thus, the presence of a surfactant in an aqueous solution of 0.1 M NaCl salt leads to a change in the growth dynamics of the bubble ensemble, since small bubbles are not able to float to the surface, due to the prevalence of viscous and vibrational forces over buoyancy force.","[Fattalov, O.; Lyubimova, T.; Rybkin, K.; Kozlov, M.; Kuchinskiy, M.] Inst Continuous Media Mech UB RAS, 1 Koroleva Str, Perm 614013, Russia; [Fattalov, O.; Lyubimova, T.; Rybkin, K.; Kozlov, M.; Kuchinskiy, M.] Perm State Univ, 15 Bukireva St, Perm 614990, Russia","Fattalov, O (corresponding author), Inst Continuous Media Mech UB RAS, 1 Koroleva Str, Perm 614013, Russia.;Fattalov, O (corresponding author), Perm State Univ, 15 Bukireva St, Perm 614990, Russia.",fattalov@mail.ru,"Lyubimova, Tatyana/AHE-2311-2022; Fattalov, Oscar/AGF-9716-2022","Fattalov, Oscar/0000-0002-5027-833X",Russian Science Foundation [20-69-46066],This work is supported by the Russian Science Foundation under grant 20-69-46066.,,37,0,0,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1945.0,,,,,,,,12004,10.1088/1742-6596/1945/1/012004,,7,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Mechanics",Materials Science; Mechanics,BS4HU,WOS:000719382600004,,gold,,,2022-07-14

The boiler engine in the PLTU is a closed vessel that can convert water into steam at high temperature and high pressure by utilizing heat from coal combustion. Steam flows out of the boiler engine into the steam turbine. In this turbine, there is a conversion of kinetic energy from steam into mechanical energy to drive the turbine blades. The rotation of the turbine shaft is coupled with the generator to produce electrical energy from the conversion of the magnetic field coil in the generator. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficiency of a boiler engine and to find out the best method for calculating the efficiency of a boiler engine. There are two methods used to calculate the efficiency of boiler machine, namely the direct method and the indirect method or losses method. In the direct method uses a comparison between the output (steam) and heat input (fuel) for efficiency evaluation. Meanwhile, the indirect method is done by reducing the heat generated when burning coal with losses that occur during and after the combustion process. Based on the data analyzed to determine the efficiency of the boiler machine by direct method, it can be seen that the efficiency is 87.20%.

Propagation of CME at interplanetary space is detected by solar wind parameters by speed and magnetic field. Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) has orientation to determine the shift of solar wind particle. IMF orientation can be classified by IMF cone angle and IMF clock angle. Both can be used as an indicator of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. This study aims to determine the flow of solar wind to the magnetosphere.

These insulating glass units (IGU) include a thin silver coating acting as an infrared mirror which reduces the thermal losses that occur through radiation, but at the same time reflects the microwaves for mobile communication. To address this drawback, a specific laser treatment is performed on the silver coating which strongly improves the transmission of microwaves through the window. In this study, the attenuation of microwaves signal was analyzed inside the SolAce unit in the NEST research building at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) in Dubendorf. Two configurations (with and without laser-treated glazing) were carried out by interchanging two hinged windows. The results showed a significant improvement in signal strength in the configuration with laser-treated IGUs. A transmission loss contour plot of the SolAce unit showed a highly directional propagation of the wave which suggests that more than two windows should be treated to achieve better mobile communication in the entire unit. The novel patterned coating is thus especially valuable in the building sector to increase the microwave signal for mobile communication. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation and testing of laser-treated coating for energy-eficient glazing in the building sector.","[Fleury, Jeremy; Burnier, Luc; Delaporte, Heloise; Schuler, Andreas] EPFL Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab LESO PB, Nanotechnol Solar Energy Convers Grp, Lausanne, Switzerland","Fleury, J (corresponding author), EPFL Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab LESO PB, Nanotechnol Solar Energy Convers Grp, Lausanne, Switzerland.",jeremy.fleury@epfl.ch,,"Fleury, Jeremy/0000-0002-2684-2770",Federal Office of Transport (FOT); Federal Office of Energy (SFOE); Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research on Future Energy Efficient Buildings & Districts (SCCER FEEBD),"The authors would like to express their very great appreciation to Prof. Jean-Louis Scartezzini, Pietro Florio and Ali Motamed at EPFL, as well as Peter Richner, Enrico Marchesi and Bjorn Niesen at EMPA for the constructive suggestions during the planning and organization of the measurement campaign at the NEST in Dubendorf; Carine Genoud at Swisscom for providing the measurement equipment for this research work; Bernard Cuttat, Luc Houlmann and Nicolas Noirjean at AGC, as well as Jacques Tschopp at tz menuiserie SA for the coordination and production of the laser-treated windows.

The optimization started with the end user to reduce first hot water consumption. Energy-efficient showerheads and faucets reduced hot water consumption by 10 to 25%, notably from 65.2 [l/p.day] to 48 [l/p.day] for the period of September to October 2019. A multi-criteria selection of showerheads involved end users considering other qualitative aspects like rinsing efficiency, overall feel of use, noise, and material robustness. Strict control of pipe and storing tank insulation reduced storage and distribution losses. Day and night storage temperature setpoints, water recirculation time, switching off this process after 11.00 p.m., temperature differential of start and stop loading setpoints, creating long loading cycles, ensure that the pipes are not always hot. Reducing Legionella cycles at 60 degrees to once a day avoided the need for continuous high temperatures. The combination of all these soft measures in the Swiss case study resulted in a reduction of energy consumption for hot water of 20-30%. This is equivalent to the installation of expensive solar panels for hot water. A detailed two- year monitoring of the building's hot water consumption shows the contribution of each optimization measure. The encouraging results show that without perfect control of the entire process, it is impossible to avoid a performance gap between planned and actual energy consumption.","[Flourentzou, Flourentzos; Pereira, Joshua] ESTIA SA, EPFL Innovat Pk, Lausanne, Switzerland","Flourentzou, F (corresponding author), ESTIA SA, EPFL Innovat Pk, Lausanne, Switzerland.",flourentzou@estia.ch; pereira@estia.ch,,,European Union [768576],This research/work has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation program under Grant Agreement No 768576 and project name RECO2ST.,,5,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12144,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012144,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100144,,gold,,,2022-07-14

A two-stage stochastic programming approach is used to simultaneously minimize the total annual cost and the CO2 footprint due to the electricity generation sources. The first-stage (design) variables correspond to the sizing of the devices, while the second-stage (operation) variables correspond to the scheduling of the installed system that is affected by uncertainties. The demand of a fleet of fuel cell vehicles is synthesized by means of a Poisson distribution and different scenarios are generated by random sampling. We formulate our problem as a large-scale mixed-integer linear program and we rely on a two-level approximation scheme to keep the problem computationally tractable. A solely deterministic setting which does not take into account uncertainties leads to underestimated device sizes, resulting in a significant fraction of demand remaining unserved with a consequent loss in revenue. The multi-objective optimization produces a convex Pareto front, showing that a reduction in carbon footprint comes with increasing costs and thus diminishing profit.","[Fochesato, Marta; Lygeros, John] Automat Control Lab, Phys Str 3, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Heer, Philipp] Urban Energy Syst Lab, Uberlandstr 129, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland","Fochesato, M (corresponding author), Automat Control Lab, Phys Str 3, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",mfochesato@control.ee.ethz.ch; philipp.heer@empa.ch; jlygeros@control.ee.ethz.ch,,"Heer, Philipp/0000-0003-2999-5753",Swiss Federal Office of Energy,This work is part of the Renewable Energy Management and Real-Time Control Platform (ReMaP) project supported by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy.,,9,0,0,2,2,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12034,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012034,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100034,,"gold, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2022-07-14

The study is limited to hydrodynamic loads from waves only, i.e. without current. For small seastates, the results indicate that the second order potential flow predictions of the surge QTFs agree quite well with the wave drift coefficients identified empirically from the model test data. For moderate and high seastates, second order predictions underestimate the surge wave drift coefficients for all compared diagonals of the QTFs. The discrepancies between predictions and empirical coefficients are not small, especially at the lower frequency range (below around 0.10 Hz) where the potential flow wave drift forces tend to zero.","[Fonseca, Nuno; Thys, Maxime; Berthelsen, Petter Andreas] SINTEF Ocean, Marintekn Senter, Tyholt Otto Nielsens Vei 10, N-7052 Trondheim, Norway","Fonseca, N (corresponding author), SINTEF Ocean, Marintekn Senter, Tyholt Otto Nielsens Vei 10, N-7052 Trondheim, Norway.",nuno.fonseca@sintef.no,,"Fonseca, Nuno/0000-0002-2040-7444",Research Council of Norway through the ENERGIX programme [294573]; Equinor; MacGregor; Inocean; APL Norway; RWE Renewables,"The research leading to these results has received funding from the Research Council of Norway through the ENERGIX programme (grant 294573) and industry partners Equinor, MacGregor, Inocean, APL Norway and RWE Renewables.",,21,0,0,0,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2018.0,,,,,,,,12017,10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/012017,,11,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Mechanical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BS3LW,WOS:000713005900017,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-07-14

Here, blockage describes the combined induction fields of all wind turbines inside a farm. Unlike the term might suggest, blockage not only reduces flow speeds, but also increases them; for instance along the outer edges of wind farms. Evaluating the overall impact on AEP of these gains and losses necessitates accurate wind farm induction models. Whilst engineering wake models are tuned to predict wind farm performance, existing induction zone models are all derived for accurately predicting the near field induction not the far field value important for wind farm simulations. This paper presents the induction models implemented in the wind farm simulation tool PyWake, as well as results from novel analytical models and compares their far field predictions to RANS-AD simulations of different turbines. We demonstrate that when including blockage in AEP simulations, the downstream speed-ups need to be included to avoid an unrealistic bias toward AEP loss and that wake expansion significantly impacts induction at rated thrust levels.","[Forsting, A.

We perform large-eddy simulations (LES) with actuator line modeling of a turbine operating in a moderately stable boundary layer in the presence of LLJs. We find that the turbine tip and root vortices break down quickly when the LLJ is above the turbine rotor swept area. In contrast, the wake recovery is slow, and the vortices are stable when the LLJ is in the middle or even below the rotor swept area. The LLJ shear causes significant azimuthal variation in the external aerodynamic blade loading, increasing fatigue loading on the turbines. We observe that both tangential and axial forces on the blades are highest when the blade directly interacts with the LLJ. Azimuthal variation in the tangential forces on the blades is the highest when the LLJ is above the rotor swept area, i.e. when the turbine operates in the positive shear region of LLJ, with the blade tip interacting with the LLJ.","[Gadde, Srinidhi N.] Univ Twente, JM Burgers Ctr Fluid Dynam, Max Planck Ctr Twente Complex Fluid Dynam, Phys Fluids Grp, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; Univ Twente, MESA Res Inst, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands","Gadde, SN (corresponding author), Univ Twente, JM Burgers Ctr Fluid Dynam, Max Planck Ctr Twente Complex Fluid Dynam, Phys Fluids Grp, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",s.nagaradagadde@utwente.nl; r.j.a.m.stevens@utwente.nl,"Stevens, Richard JAM/A-5427-2009","Stevens, Richard JAM/0000-0001-6976-5704; Liu, Luoqin/0000-0002-6020-3702",PRACE [2020225335],"This work is part of the Shell-NWO/FOM-initiative Computational sciences for energy research of Shell and Chemical Sciences, Earth and Live Sciences, Physical Sciences, FOM, and STW.

The stone model was scanned by an extraoral digital scanner and a digital copy of the prosthetic field was created. The digital copy was used to create a digital prototype of the future metal substructure for the metal-ceramic crown. Using the same data, the metal substructure was formed once by milling technology, and once by 3D-printing technology. The internal surface of both samples was measured. The stone model preparation surface was also measured. All data were compared to the digital prototype. According to the standard technology, a dental technician applied ceramic material, by hand as usual, in layers and the constructions were sintered. After the thermal procedure, once again the substructure's internal surface was measured and compared with the previous data. The constructions were finished by glazing by the dental technician applying the last layer ceramic and sintering it. The construction's internal surface was again measured and the data obtained were compared with the previous data. Conclusion about the influence of the temperature changes caused by the sintering process on the metal substructures was made using the data acquired by all the measurements made between the different stages. The difference in the internal fit of the constructions made by the milling and the 3D-printing technology will not affect to crown's ergonomics. The quality of the internal fit for the construction made by milling technology is better than this made by 3D-printing technology. Unnoticeable changes in the internal surface were found after the temperature changes caused by the process of sintering for both types of constructions. Both types of technologies could be used to produce high quality accurate metal substructures for the needs of the fixed prosthetic dental medicine.

Results showed that the investigated strategies presented lower temperatures than the external conditions and the control module. The alternative that combined indirect evaporative cooling with thermal mass, solar protection, and night radiative cooling was the most promising, with a temperature reduction of 4.2 K, relative to the mean exterior temperature, and a decrease of 8.3 K of its maximum temperature relative to the maximum exterior temperature. An additional strategy was implemented in this alternative using a phase change material, that further reduced its temperature by 6.3 K, relative to the mean exterior temperature and a reduction of 11.5 K of its maximum temperature compared to the maximum exterior temperature. It is expected that these findings are applicable in actual buildings in warm-humid regions to reduce energy consumption for air conditioning, whilst improving hygrothermal comfort and health of occupants.","[Garcia Chavez, Jose Roberto; Carrillo Salas, Anais] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Garcia Pardo, Karina A.] Univ Seville, Escuela Tec Super Arquitectura Sevilla, Seville, Spain","Chavez, JRG (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Metropolitana, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",joserobertogsol@gmail.com; doc.anasalas@gmail.com; gkarinap9@gmail.com,,,,,,5,0,0,4,4,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12098,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012098,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100098,,gold,,,2022-07-14

In particular, the performance of measurement systems using two or more cameras to estimate the displacement of 3D markers placed on the surface of a plate are analyzed by simulation. The projection of the markers on the image plane of each camera is calculated assuming a perfectly calibrated system, in which the errors in the 3D reconstruction of the marker positions are substantially determined by the intrinsic pixellation intrinsic to the measurement process. The acoustic pressure in space is finally calculated, starting from the position of the markers, by means of the Rayleigh integral. The accuracy of the estimate is evaluated by varying the geometry of the cameras setup, their resolution and their number. The results presented show that the estimation of the acoustic radiation is substantially more accurate than the accuracy with which the vibration is estimated. The effect is due to the smoothing operation intrinsically linked to the Rayleigh integration procedure. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of optical systems with multiple, relatively low-cost low-resolution cameras for the measurement of the acoustic pressure field generated by flexural vibrations of distributed structures.","[Gardonio, P.; Rinaldo, R.; Del Sal, R.; Dal Bo, L.; Turco, E.; Fusiello, A.] Univ Udine, DPIA, Via Sci 206, I-33100 Udine, Italy","Gardonio, P (corresponding author), Univ Udine, DPIA, Via Sci 206, I-33100 Udine, Italy.",paolo.gardonio@uniud.it,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2041.0,,,,,,,,12013,10.1088/1742-6596/2041/1/012013,,10,"Mechanics; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing; Optics; Physics, Applied",Mechanics; Materials Science; Optics; Physics,BS4XT,WOS:000723958200013,,gold,,,2022-07-14

Calculations have shown that the rate of material deformation in the working part of the blade specimen can differ significantly from that calculated by the movement of tensile testing machine grips. This is due to the unevenness of the cross-section of blade sample: in the middle (working part) it is constant, and at the ends its area increases. As a result, inhomogeneous stress fields arise in the material, which leads to a variable deformation rate of the specimen working part, even in case when grips move at a constant speed. This effect is not significant at small deformations and a low strain rate and can be ignored in principle. However, in the case of large extensions high speeds, it can seriously distort the test results. According to the authors, the way out of this situation is that, in experiments with viscoelastic polymers, it is better to use annular specimens with the same cross-section along the entire length, rather than blade ones. As shown by computer calculations, in this case, this problem almost completely ceases to exist.","[Garishin, Oleg K.; Sokolov, Alexander K.] Inst Continuous Media Mech UB RAS, Perm, Russia; [Pelevin, Alexander G.] Perm State Univ, Perm, Russia","Garishin, OK (corresponding author), Inst Continuous Media Mech UB RAS, Perm, Russia.",gar@icmm.ru,,,RFBR [AAAA-A20-120022590044-7];  [19-08-00725],"The work was carried out within the framework of the state budget financing of I.MM UB RAS on the topic with registration number: AAAA-A20-120022590044-7, as well as with financial support of RFBR Grant 19-08-00725.",,26,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1945.0,,,,,,,,12006,10.1088/1742-6596/1945/1/012006,,7,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Mechanics",Materials Science; Mechanics,BS4HU,WOS:000719382600006,,gold,,,2022-07-14

This transfer is evidenced by the registration of a narrow magneto-optical resonance in the fluorescence. It should also be noted that even after multiple cascade transitions, the resonance observed on the infrared lines has a much better signal/noise ratio compared to that on the excited second resonance line.

New metrics have been developed to quantify the NIF effects of light. In order to incorporate these in lighting design practice, simulation tools are required that are able to process information about the spectral distribution of light sources and materials. However, most of the tools currently used for daylight and electric light simulations simplify the spectrum into RGB (Red, Green, Blue) colour values. This paper presents an overview of the currently used programs for simulating the NIF effects of light in building design and discusses the possibility of using existing spectral rendering software as an alternative. A review of literature shows that mostly Radiance or Radiance-based programs have been used so far, but new user-friendly tools could employ existing spectral rendering tools. As the NIF effects of light gain greater importance in lighting design, new simulation workflows are needed. This paper aims to support the development of future workflows by presenting the current state-of-the-art.","[Gkaintatzi-Masouti, M.; van Duijnhoven, J.; Aarts, M. P.

The data obtained by 6 inclinometers located at different height were used to determine the inclination of the headframe and distortion of its shape. Analysis of long-term observation data revealed the existence of deformation processes having different time scales (long-term, seasonal and daily). A correlation between changes in the tilt angle of the structure and ambient temperature was established. Long-term monitoring of tilt angle showed that the displacements of the structure were within the permissible limiting values.

The anthropogenic climate change results in a steady increase of hot days, tropical nights and heavy rainfall, affecting the quality of human comfort, especially in urban areas not only in hot regions of the world but also in Central Europe. Vertical greening systems are often a first-choice mitigation strategy to improve the deteriorating situation. By combining the use of natural resources like rainwater and solar radiation, the greening evaporates water and provides natural cooling. This paper deals with the efficiency and feasibility of vertical greening systems towards a relief in heat stress by simulating different constructions under local circumstances of three climate zones, focusing on the night-time. To carry out the simulations with microclimate simulation tool ENVI-met, an urban apartment complex was designed and provided with different kinds of vertical greening to investigate the various positive effects resulting from the green facade. As a shading device, the greened walls showed a significant decrease of wall surface temperatures of up to 18K. However, restricted transpiration fluxes obstruct exploiting the full potential of evaporative cooling, especially during night-time.","[Goergen, Fabian; Rossi-Schwarzenbeck, Monica] Leipzig Univ Appl Sci HTWK Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany","Gorgen, F (corresponding author), Leipzig Univ Appl Sci HTWK Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.",fabian.goergen@htwk-leipzig.de; monica.rossi@htwk-leipzig.de,,"Gorgen, Fabian/0000-0001-8270-5845; Rossi, Monica/0000-0002-8729-1554",,,,11,0,0,3,3,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12056,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012056,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100056,,gold,,,2022-07-14

A reference 10MW wind turbine is studied, mounted on a commercial enhanced spar buoy, referred to as the WIND-bos platform. The focus is put on the hydrodynamic modeling. In particular, the Morison equation is used, accounting for a fixed set of coefficients. Those coefficients are initially estimated based on the literature, and subsequently calibrated through the comparison with experimental results on a scaled geometry. This allows to assess the modeling capabilities of the Morison approach, together with its challenges and limitations. Larger discrepancies between the numerical model and the experiments were assumed to be related to the geometrical particularities of the floating platform. In particular, the studied structure accounts for both large and slender members, potentially limiting the applicability of the method. It is shown that the deviations could be attributed to the frequency-variation of parameters such as the added mass, the radiation damping and viscous damping. Therefore, it is concluded that the agreement between the numerical model and the experiments could be improved by re-calibrating the coefficients for each of the studied sea states.","[Gonzalez, Guido Grassi; Urban, Albert Meseguer; Horcas, Sergio Gonzalez; Roqueta, Laura Volta, I] Tech Univ Denmark DTU, Dept Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Blanco, Sergio Hernandez] BlueNewables, C El Vizconde 7, St Cruz De Tenerife 38670, Spain","Horcas, SG (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark DTU, Dept Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",sgho@dtu.dk,"Horcas, Sergio Gonzalez/AAT-1294-2021","Horcas, Sergio Gonzalez/0000-0002-4034-3118",European Commission through the MARINET project (Marine Renewables Infrastructure Network for Emerging Energy Technologies),The experimental tests results used in this work were funded by the European Commission through the MARINET project (Marine Renewables Infrastructure Network for Emerging Energy Technologies).,,20,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2018.0,,,,,,,,12019,10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/012019,,11,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Mechanical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BS3LW,WOS:000713005900019,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-07-14

The present study proposes simplified procedures to enable the application of complex hydrodynamic modelling software (SWMM), by non-expert users (such as planners and designers), in the preliminary phases of an urban space project according to a water-sensitive urban design approach. In the paper, Italian multi-level regulations aimed at controlling the impacts of excessive rainfall in urban areas are taken into account as well as the integration of circular water management systems with evaporative cooling strategies. The proposed procedure is focused on two aspects: 1- to simplify the steps needed to convert the existing climatic data to provide a numerical sequence, to insert into the software; 2- to define a set of pre-compiled and multi-purposed solutions toolkits for the design of urban spaces that can be imported into the software through an external database.","[Guimaraes, M.

However, this approach does not consider the physical aspects of the occurrence of local areas of plastic deformation, which ultimately means the impossibility of predicting the fracture, and, consequently, the resource of the structure. This is especially evident in the conditions of cyclic loading, when the material can fail at stresses well below the traditional fatigue limit. In the current work, an approach is proposed that allows to save traditional methods of design and resource forecasting by expanding the scale of modeling. The paper introduces the concept of inherent stress concentration in any structurally heterogeneous medium as its inherent attribute. A universal algorithm for determining this characteristic is presented.","[Gulin, V. V.; Nikitin, A.

For eight dwellings, heat pump electricity use per heating degree day was found to decrease by 10% and narrow baseline peaks were suppressed during the control phase. Daily mean grid electricity import and heat pump electricity use in the peak period (4pm - 7pm) were measured as 4.0 kWh and 1.4 kWh during the control phase as compared to 3.8kWh and 1.3 kWh for the baseline phase.

This flexibility potential can be expressed in flexibility factors. The usefulness of four factors is investigated based on load control for the heat pump of a small apartment building according to electricity prices (high/low tariffs, spot market prices), CO2eq emissions share in the grid and a restricted operation period during daytime. The calculation methodology of the presented flexibility factors GSC, RIP, FF and FI is very different. RIP and FF are preferable because they have defined valid ranges which makes them easier to understand. Current electricity prices force the heat pump operation mainly into the night. The optimization of CO2eq emissions encourages operation mainly during the day. The optimization goals costs or CO2eq emissions thus lead to opposing heat pump operation times and can currently therefore not both be met simultaneously.","[Hall, Monika; Geissler, Achim] Univ Appl Sci & Arts Northwestern Switzerland, Inst Sustainabil & Energy Construct, Hofackerstr 30, CH-4132 Muttenz, Switzerland","Hall, M (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci & Arts Northwestern Switzerland, Inst Sustainabil & Energy Construct, Hofackerstr 30, CH-4132 Muttenz, Switzerland.",monika.hall@fhnw.ch,,,Swiss Federal Office of Energy SFOE [BFE SI/501240],The work described in this paper was funded by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy SFOE under contract number BFE SI/501240 as a contribution to IEA Annex 67 Energy Flexible Buildings.,,12,1,1,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12036,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012036,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100036,,gold,,,2022-07-14

However, energy retrofit was found to be under-researched in the Egyptian context. This paper presents a pilot study that aims to identify cost optimal retrofit strategies for one of the soon to be vacated buildings, the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS). Using DesignBuilder, an energy modelling study was implemented to estimate the existing performance of the building, assess the projected performance after a change of use (to an office building), and evaluate the cost optimality and the savings associated with the application of retrofit measures. The study found that the feasibility of implementing retrofit can be significantly offset by the discount rates in Egypt. As such, maintaining economic stability and considering non-economic incentives can be key drivers to increasing the energy retrofit uptake in Egypt.","[Hamada, A.; Raslan, R.; Mumovic, D.] UCL, Inst Environm Design & Engn, London, England","Hamada, A (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Environm Design & Engn, London, England.",amr.hamada.19@ucl.ac.uk,,"Raslan, Rokia/0000-0003-3157-4843; Mumovic, Dejan/0000-0002-4914-9004",,,,16,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12160,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012160,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100160,,gold,,,2022-07-14

Abstract mathematical concepts are not always well received by kindergarten students. Therefore, to support optimal child development, appropriate stimulants are needed. Some kindergarten students experience still have difficulties in summing numbers abstractly. There are also those who have difficulty in the counting process, both outlining and adding up. In addition, there are also students who are less able to write the large number of objects into numerical symbols. Given the various difficulties that can be experienced by kindergarten students in learning the concepts of addition and subtraction, one way that can be used to introduce the concepts of addition and subtraction in kindergarten students is by using the Iceberg approach. Iceberg is known as an iceberg phenomenon. The process of forming icebergs in the sea always starts from the bottom beneath the surface of the sea and so on finally forms the tip of the iceberg that appears above sea level. The base of the iceberg is wider than its peak, thus the construction of the iceberg becomes sturdy and stable. Introducing a mathematical concept based on the Iceberg approach means that in the iceberg model there are four levels of activity, namely: 1) mathematical orientation of the environment, 2) Model of teaching aids, 3) making of foundations (Building stone), and 4) formal mathematics. With this step it is hoped that kindergarten students who are still in the preoperational stage can more easily understand abstract mathematical concepts because the concept begins with the introduction of concrete objects around students. The purpose of this study is to developing mathematics activity books based on the Iceberg theory to introduce the concepts of addition and subtraction for kindergarten.","[Handayani, A.

To address this, and to respond to increasing homebuyers' interest in renewable energy, this study looks to demonstrate how relatively minor design changes could affect the potential for solar generation and create 'solar ready' homes without compromising on the aesthetic of the roof morphologies in styles expected by homebuyers. It looked at six different roof morphological forms ranging from small to large houses, a common suburban house archetype in Canada. The roof configurations were remodelled to remove 'fake dormers', minimise ridges and valleys, etc. This process helped maximize the south, south-east, south-west, east and west facing surfaces.

Predominantly, the GCs are used to connect the foundation piles with the jacket support structure. Additionally, it can be applied for monopile substructures. A challenging and scientifically still marginally analysed detail of grouted connections is the influence of early age movement (EAM), also known as early age cycling (EAC) on the final load bearing behaviour of the connection. After grouting and until the end of the curing of the material, the offshore structure is partially supported by fluid grout material for several hours. During this time waves and current affect the soft connections. This leads to relative movement during the curing of GCs, which is known as EAM. Previous investigations showed grout material damage due to vertical EAM. These results form the basis of the current offshore guideline limits. According to DNVGL-OS-J101 from 2014, it must be ensured that during the curing process the vertical EAM does not exceed 1 mm. Since 2016 the limit value also applies for the lateral EAM according to DNVGL. However, the influence of lateral EAM on the load bearing behaviour is barely experimentally nor numerically investigated. Thus, the authors are involved in a comprehensive research project (GREAM) addressing this topic. This paper focusses on Finite Element Analysis of different support structures under varying boundary conditions and sea states to analyse the amplitude of lateral EAM of grouted connections.","[Henneberg, Joshua; Schaumann, Peter] Inst Steel Construct Forwind, Appelstr 9A, D-30167 Hannover, Germany","Henneberg, J (corresponding author), Inst Steel Construct Forwind, Appelstr 9A, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",henneberg@stahl.uni-hannover.de,,"Schaumann, Peter/0000-0001-8543-960X",German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) [0324257]; BMWi; DNV GL; Siemens Gamesa; Wilke & Schiele Consulting GmbH; BAM and Pagel Spezial-Beton GmbH Co.

The subjects of the research were 72 students in grade 11. The cognitive load was measured in three aspects; intrinsic cognitive load (ICL), extraneous cognitive load (ECL), and germane cognitive load (GCL). The data were analysed descriptively to show differences in the component of cognitive loads and tested for multivariate correlation-regression to show relations between the components of cognitive load. ICL and GCL were measured inversely proportional with score of students science process skill, due to well performed science process skill and knowledge construction skill are results from low ICL and GCL respectively. Whereas ECL was measured proportionally with students' metal effort because students bear low mental effort in thinking when the ECL is low. After the implementation of VIPSTA experiment worksheet, students obtained increment for science processing skill and knowledge construction skill and decrease for mental effort which indicated low ICL, GCL, and ECL. Meaning that the use of VIPSTA experiment worksheet enables a decrease in students' cognitive load. Furthermore, the data analysis showed that the decrease of GCL was heavily influenced by the decrease of ICL and ECL indicating that VIPSTA experiment worksheet was able provide meaningful laboratory activity by facilitating knowledge construction through lower load in processing information and performing procedure while conducting experiment.","[Hindriana, A.

These techniques essentially replace the blade geometry with applied body forces, which reduce the resolved length scales significantly and hence the required grid resolution. This work is a verification of the coupling between the flow solver EllipSys3D and the aeroelastic tool Flex5, through a quantitative comparison of coupled actuator line, coupled actuator disc, and standalone Flex5. Steady state performance predictions, instantaneous reaction to turbulence and damage equivalent load analyses all show a very good agreement between the three methods. Differences can be explained primarily by the higher fidelity modelling of the coupled simulations; this is particularly in regard to the influence of blade flexibility, as the actuators deflect and interact with the modelled flow. Additionally, some overpredictions of loading at the blade tip and root below rated velocity for the actuator methods can be attributed to the Gaussian smearing used to apply the body forces.","[Hodgson, E.

The 1D momentum theory emerges from an inviscid, steady and irrotational analysis of the streamtube surrounding a wind turbine while the wake aerodynamics under yaw is modified. In this work, the mean flow streamtube around a single DTU 10MW wind turbine, under yaw misalignement and turbulent inflow is investigated with Large-Eddy Simulation combined to the Actuator Line method. The simulations are performed on a highly resolved grid counting billions of elements. The streamtube construction from the mean flow is based on the transport of accurate conservative level set functions. Integration of local flow quantities within the streamtube presents similarities when the streamtube expansion occurs past the turbine until the velocity deficit starts to recover. Mean kinetic energy and momentum budget are then presented to explain the yawed wake recovery and deflection process. Background turbulence plays a key role in the recovery process while the deflection of the wake is impacted by pressure forces on the streamtube. From these budgets, four wake regions showing similar flow dynamics are defined and correlated to local flow structures.","[Houtin-Mongrolle, F.; Benard, P.; Lartigue, G.; Moureau, V] Normandie Univ, INSA Rouen, UNIROUEN, CNRS,CORIA, F-76000 Rouen, France","Houtin-Mongrolle, F (corresponding author), Normandie Univ, INSA Rouen, UNIROUEN, CNRS,CORIA, F-76000 Rouen, France.",felix.houtin-mongrolle@coria.fr,"Mongrolle, Félix Houtin/ABF-4305-2020; MOUREAU, Vincent/E-5544-2013","Mongrolle, Félix Houtin/0000-0001-9849-1829; MOUREAU, Vincent/0000-0003-4574-7709","PRACE project untitled Wind Turbines Multi Physics [2020225444]; GENCI, France [A0082A11335]; CRIANN, France [2012006]","This work was granted access to HPC resources from TGCC, France through the PRACE project untitled Wind Turbines Multi Physics under the allocation 2020225444 and through GENCI, France under allocation A0082A11335 and from CRIANN, France, under the allocation 2012006.",,21,1,1,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1934.0,,,,,,,,12011,10.1088/1742-6596/1934/1/012011,,10,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Mechanical; Mechanics; Physics, Fluids & Plasmas",Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Mechanics; Physics,BS3JN,WOS:000712011500011,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-07-14

The relative difference between the results calculated with the 0/0 approach and the time-dependent approach were larger for the building with the wooden structure. A more detailed analysis identified biogenic carbon as the source that was most responsible for this difference in results. For this reason, biogenic carbon should be treated separately and must be calculated with the time-dependent approach.

The results show that the internal thermal mass of the studied buildings influences their thermal performance and future potential energy demand for heating and cooling. Buildings with insulation positioned on the outside, with high thermal mass and high thermal time constant showed the best thermal performance for different climatic zones, whereas buildings without thermal insulation or with insulation from the inside showed the worst thermal performance.

Many potential energy resources can be converted into electrical energy. One of the potential energy resources is the flow of water that can be used for micro-hydropower plants for remote areas. This paper presents the results of research on micro-hydro power plants using Archimedes screw turbines. This power generation system has several advantages, namely low maintenance costs, does not damage the water ecosystem, does not require extensive land. The purpose of this research is to study the characteristics of the Archimedes micro-hydro power plant on variations in water discharge. These characteristics include mechanical characteristics such as the maximum torque and rpm and electrical characteristics such as voltage, current and electric power. The determination of characteristics is carried out on the prototype of the micro hydropower plant Archimedes screw turbine with the specifications of the turbine screw having 2 blades, the turbine elevation angle of 30 degrees, 2.5: 1 gearbox ratio using four variations of water discharge, namely 1.18 1/s, 2.33 1/s, 2.55 1/s, and 2.64 1/s. The determination results of the micro hydropower plant Archimedes screw turbine characteristics show that an increase in water flow will cause an increase in mechanical characteristics such as large torque and rpm and electrical characteristics such as voltage, current and electric power. However, the increase in the magnitude of these characteristics is not directly proportional to the increase in water discharge.","[Indarto, B.; Ramazhoni, D. A.; Bustomi, M.

The study was performed on a non-magnetic sphere in a cylindrical container filled with the magnetic fluid and magnetized by a uniform magnetic field. The symmetry of the experimental setup allowed the simplification of the problem: 2D axisymmetric numerical simulation corresponded to the 1D experimental measurements. The magnetic ponderomotive force turned out to be non-monotonic: it has two extrema and one or three zero values depending on the geometrical parameters of the container and magnitude of the applied field intensity. It was shown that wall effects are crucial for this problem, because the ponderomotive force in the vicinity of the container's bottom (or top) may change its sign (direction). This behaviour can be described only in the framework of the inductive approach, which takes into account all demagnetizing fields generated by the ferrofluid container. On the contrary, the simplified non-inductive approach is unable to explain the magnetic force behaviour, especially the wall effects.","[Ivanov, A. S.; Khokhryakova, C.

However, it also alters the spectrum and distribution of light entering through the facade, which influences certain visual attributes associated with a space. This user assessment study evaluates some of these attributes including the colour perception of the elements inside and outside the room, the uniformity of daylight distribution, the clarity of the view through the glazing and the perception of glare when the sun is in the field of view. Results indicate a visual transmittance (tv) of 0.6% is sufficient to control glare when the sun is in the peripheral field of view (FOV) while tv, n-n of 0.14% is required to control glare when the sun is close to the central FOV.

In this study, advanced techniques for feature identification are explored to correlate objective metrics to subjective perception retrieved from jury tests. The data set referes to the interior noise of a regional propeller aircraft. Artificial Neural Network and two regression models (i.e. linear and quadratic regression models) have been chosen to predict subjective metrics according to the objective data. To obtain the optimized model parameters for the regression models, a Genetic Algorithm has been used as optimization strategy. In each modelling, 85 percent of sound sample data have been utilized to perform the model and remaining 15 percent have been reserved for testing the models.

In this regard, three urban neighbourhoods are generated based on a novel urban morphology parameterization method and assessed in two extreme low and high wind conditions. Results showed that wind speed (up to 75%) and air temperature (up to 28%) at the microscale can get amplified or dampened in extreme conditions. A negative correlation was observed between wind speed and air temperature variations indicating a great potential to reduce outdoor air temperature through heat removal in urban canyons. The findings of the study are categorized based on the morphological parameters to present a series of design-based strategies for the newly-built urban neighbourhoods.","[Javanroodi, K.; Scartezzini, Jl] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Nik, V.

Prospecting the (urban) anthropogenic mine represents an essential step towards circular construction and requires a robust methodology for data collection and interpretation. This paper presents a comparative analysis of survey methods, evaluated by parameters of time, accuracy, equipment, and labor to determine the ability of each tool in providing the necessary data to activate the existing built environment as a material resource. Chosen methods span from on-site manual and analog surveys to off-site digital technologies on a variety of case study scales.

It was found that over the range of wave conditions considered, the turbine nacelle motion did not exceed the motion limits for technician working considered in this analysis. Further analysis found that the turbine nacelle motion increased with increasing significant wave height and was also significantly influenced by peak wave period. The impact of differing wave characteristics is also investigated through the use of different wave energy spectra and also found to have an impact on turbine nacelle motion.","[Jenkins, Brian; Prothero, Arran; Collu, Maurizio; Carroll, James; McMillan, David] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [McDonald, Alasdair] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Jenkins, B (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",brian.jenkins@strath.ac.uk,,,EPSRC through the Wind and Marine Energy Systems Centre for Doctoral Training [EP/L016680/1],The authors would like to acknowledge EPSRC for funding this work through the Wind and Marine Energy Systems Centre for Doctoral Training under the grant number EP/L016680/1.,,14,1,1,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2018.0,,,,,,,,12023,10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/012023,,10,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Mechanical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BS3LW,WOS:000713005900023,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2022-07-14

The wake properties depend on many parameters such as the stratification, Coriolis force, large-scale forcing and orography. To simulate this interdependence, the actuator line method (ALM) has been implemented in the atmospheric code Meso-NH, which is an LES research code developed by the French weather services. This implementation has already been validated for the blade force distribution on the NewMexico case (uniform inflow in a wind tunnel) and for the interaction with the atmosphere on the Horns Rev photo case. The work presented here aims at completing the validation in a realistic atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), with a focus on velocity deficit and wake meandering. It is based on the international SWiFT benchmark which compares the results of many numerical models with LiDAR measurements in the wake of a single turbine for three cases of atmospheric stability: neutral, unstable and stable. The good results show the capacity of Meso-NH/ALM to generate realistic wakes in a representative ABL.","[Jezequel, E.; Cathelain, M.; Blondel, F.] IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1-4 Ave Bois Preau, Rueil Malmaison, France; [Jezequel, E.; Masson, V] Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, Toulouse, France","Jezequel, E (corresponding author), IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1-4 Ave Bois Preau, Rueil Malmaison, France.;Jezequel, E (corresponding author), Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, Toulouse, France.",erwan.jezequel@ifpen.fr,,"Jezequel, Erwan/0000-0001-5024-364X; Blondel, Frederic/0000-0002-3252-2781",,,,18,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1934.0,,,,,,,,12003,10.1088/1742-6596/1934/1/012003,,10,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Mechanical; Mechanics; Physics, Fluids & Plasmas",Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Mechanics; Physics,BS3JN,WOS:000712011500003,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-07-14

Laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) is a non-contact and non-destructive vibration detector suitable for acquire broadband signals remotely and continuously. The significant signal issue is speckle noise mainly by LDV scanning from moving platforms (LDVom). This paper presents a novel approach based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition for eliminating speckle noise. The instantaneous frequency in intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) corresponds to the instantaneous vibration that is acquired by LDVom, and the signal is continuous in a sole IMF. In numerical simulations, the EEMD-based approach can effectively reveal the true vibration despite intensive noise. The correlation coefficient remains over 0.9 when the initial signal-to-noise ratio decreases to -15 db. In experiments, the 500 Hz vibration is almost revealed by EEMD regardless of the noise intensity and the vibration strength. Therefore, our approach is applicable in eliminating speckle noise.","[Jin, Yang; Li, Zili] Delft Univ Technol, Railway Engn, Delft, Netherlands","Li, ZL (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Railway Engn, Delft, Netherlands.",Z.Li@tudelft.nl,,,,,,14,0,0,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2041.0,,,,,,,,12007,10.1088/1742-6596/2041/1/012007,,6,"Mechanics; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing; Optics; Physics, Applied",Mechanics; Materials Science; Optics; Physics,BS4XT,WOS:000723958200007,,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-07-14

Therefore, this study aims to use symbol sense characteristics for designing mathematics tasks for secondary school students. To do this, using a design research method, we conducted a literature study to collect characteristics of symbol sense and to see possibilities of designing mathematics tasks in general. Next, we designed mathematics tasks according to the symbol sense characteristics. Finally, we provided possible responses of students for the designed tasks. The results of this study included six types of tasks according to the characteristics of symbol sense, including tasks on symbolic problems and word problems-which require translation into symbolic problems.

The model has been applied to a block of 12 2-bedroom terraced houses with a 184m(2) PVT array on the south facing side of the roof. It was identified that well-designed seasonal PVT heating configurations and control schemes are required to maximise PVT outputs. PVT dual thermal modes occur when the PV is either connected to a load or producing at close to the maximum power point. Integrating the dual modes into a control system could be more economical if heat tariffs were higher than electrical ones when heat demand is greater than the PVT thermal output.","[Kang, Anneka] UCL Energy Inst, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England; [Korolija, Ivan; Rovas, Dimitrios] UCL Inst Environm Design & Engn IEDE, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England","Kang, A (corresponding author), UCL Energy Inst, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",a.kang.17@ucl.ac.uk,,"Rovas, Dimitrios/0000-0002-5639-6783",,,,20,0,0,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12090,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012090,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100090,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-07-14

It is based on cytotoxic products generation after the excitation of absorbed photosensitizing drugs by non-ionizing radiation. The wavelength chosen is usually in the 620 700 nm region, resulting in limited tissue penetration depth. The relatively low irradiance values and the treatment time that, in most cases, lasts for a few minutes result in limited photothermal effects, which are usually overlooked. Therefore, in this study we computationally assess the temperature distribution during PDT in a cancer bearing mouse model. A user-friendly application is created that could be used in the treatment planning step of PDT. It receives as input various parameters, such as laser power, beam radius, irradiation time, body temperature and returns the maximum tissue temperature and irradiance values. Furthermore, it offers visualization of the generated effects through the spatial distribution of temperature, irradiance, acute necrosis and damaged tissue percentage that are presented in the form of interactive 3D plots. The conducted simulations reveal that 43 degrees C, which are in the hyperthermia range, are difficult to be excessed in PDT clinical practice, although topical thermal effects are observed.","[Kareliotis, G.; Kalkou, M.; Tsigaridas, G.; Makropoulou, M.; Serafetinides, A.

The wave motion of the surface was induced by a homogeneous oscillating magnetic field orthogonal to the layer. In this case two types of waves can be formed on the surface of a magnetic fluid: a standing wave of the same frequency as the alternating magnetic field, and a standing wave, independent of the field frequency. The paper reviews the main theoretical and experimental studies of wave instability of such systems. The stability of a two-layered liquid system in an alternating vertical magnetic field is investigated. For efficient processing of the experimental results, the optical part of the experimental setup was modified. An algorithm has been developed for processing the profiles of the magnetic fluid surface obtained during the experiment, which helps to determine the length of the generated waves.","[Khokhryakova, C.

The crucible was placed in an MHD stirrer, which generated a travelling and rotating magnetic fields ensuring in such a way bidirectional stirring of the liquid metal in the crucible. After introducing the reinforcing particles, aluminum was stirred and directionally crystallized. Reinforcing particles were introduced into molten aluminum as a component of pressed pellets. Pellets with diameter of 20 mm and thickness of 15 mm were made from a mixture of aluminum powder (100-156 mu m) and reinforcing nanoparticles (100-200 nm) by pressing in a special pellet die. The concentration of reinforcing particles in the pellets was selected using preliminary experiments and was 5% of their total weight. In some experiments, the aluminum was reinforced with SiC nanoparticles introduced into the melt in the amount of 0.59%, 1.04%, 1.77%, while in other experiments the concentration of hexagonal BN nanoparticles introduced into aluminum was 7%, 1%, 1.8% of the ingot weight. As the experiment showed, the reinforcing particles formulated into tablets can be introduced into aluminum by means of MHD stirring. The dependence of the ultimate strength and electrical resistance of aluminum on the concentration of the reinforcing nanoparticles introduced into it has been obtained experimentally. It has been found that with an increase in the concentration of nanoparticles in aluminum, its ultimate strength and specific electrical resistance increase. The dependences of the ultimate strength and electrical resistance of aluminum on the concentration of SiC and BN nanoparticles are very similar and close to linear (in the investigated range of concentrations of introduced particles. With an increase in the concentration of introduced nanoparticles the mechanical strength of the resulting material grows faster than the electrical resistivity. In the experiments, the ultimate strength of the samples increased by 22%, while the electrical resistance increased by 5-6%. This opens up new possibilities for industrial applications of such materials, for example, in manufacture of self-supporting wires in power lines.","[Khripchenko, S.; Dolgikh, V] Inst Continuous Media Mech UB RAS, Perm, Russia; [Kiselkov, D.] Inst Tech Chem UB RAS, Perm, Russia","Khripchenko, S (corresponding author), Inst Continuous Media Mech UB RAS, Perm, Russia.",khripch@icmm.ru; dolgikh@icmm.ru; dkiselkov@yandex.ru,"Kiselkov, Dmitriy/B-2300-2014","Kiselkov, Dmitriy/0000-0002-0237-2743",RFBR [19-48-590001],The work was supported by the RFBR (Grant.19-48-590001._.),,13,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1945.0,,,,,,,,12017,10.1088/1742-6596/1945/1/012017,,8,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Mechanics",Materials Science; Mechanics,BS4HU,WOS:000719382600017,,gold,,,2022-07-14

Since offshore turbines operate in lower turbulence levels, the intrinsic hydrodynamic unstable modes of the tip vortices can have even more relevance than in onshore turbines. For floating turbines, platform motion induced by wind and wave loads can trigger vortex instabilities, modifying the wake structure, possibly influencing the flow reaching downstream wind turbines. In the present paper, we study those effects by the means of numerical simulations and their comparison with analytical studies. In our simulations, the wind turbine blades are modeled as actuator lines in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Heave motion with different amplitudes and frequencies are studied. The effect of increasing amplitude is to advance the onset of vortex interaction. For the lower frequency of heave motion, several vortices coalesce to form a large flow structure. High amplitude of oscillations in the streamwise velocity were observed due to these flow structures, which may increase fatigue or induce high amplitude motion on downstream turbines. The number of vortices that interact, as other qualitative phenomena of the numerical simulation, were well predicted by a simple stability model of two-dimensional row of vortices. The disturbances imposed by the heave motion were also compared to the eigenvectors resulting from linear stability theory for helical vortices and the predicted growth rates for the wavenumbers resulting from this comparison were consistent with the model of a row of vortices. These results motivate further studies to understand the impact of the larger flow structures on downstream turbines.","[Kleine, V. G.; Hanifi, A.; Henningson, D.

The diffuse deterioration of material's strength is modelled using porosity as a damage parameter. We show that the local damage model yields simulation results, pathologically dependent on the FEM mesh upon mesh refinement: (i) the structural behaviour becomes unrealistically brittle; (ii) the FEM mesh determines the crack path. To solve these problems, an integral-based approach to nonlocal damage is implemented. It enables physically sound results by introducing the linear size of the microstructure into the model's formulation. To prevent the effect of unrealistic diffusion of damage, the averaging operator is applied not to the porosity, but to its dual parameter, material's continuity. Solutions of test problems for crack propagation in a compact tension specimen are presented. The convergence of FEM solutions is demonstrated for different slopes of the mesh with fine and coarse discretizations.","[Klyuchancev, V.

The air flow overturning was observed in the winter season due to the ingress of cold heavy air from the surface into the shaft space. To analyze this phenomenon, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of heat and mass transfer processes in a mine shaft was developed, considering the vertical temperature gradient, roughness of the shaft walls, heat exchange with the shaft lining. Based on numerical simulation, it was found that at relatively low air velocities in the shaft and with a relatively large difference between warm air in the shaft and cold air on the surface, the latter begins to penetrate the shaft and descend down it, gradually filling its space. The interaction of cold air from the surface with the warm air rising up the shaft, as well as with warm walls of the shaft leads to the formation of an unsteady convective vortex cellular structure along the shaft. The depth of the vortex depends on the velocity of the air in the shaft, as well as the difference between the temperatures of the warm and cold air.

In this work, Reinforcement Learning is applied to wind farm control for the first time to the authors' best knowledge. To demonstrate the optimization abilities of the newly developed framework, parameters of an already existing control strategy, the helix approach, are tuned to optimize the total power production of a small wind farm. This also includes an extension of the helix approach to multiple turbines. Furthermore, it is attempted to develop novel control strategies based on the control of the generator torque. The results are analysed and difficulties in the setup in regards to Reinforcement Learning are discussed. The tuned helix approach yields a total power increase of 6.8 % on average for the investigated case, while the generator torque controller does not yield an increase in total power.

It is shown that as a result of SH-synthesis in the free burning mode, a metal-ceramic sinter of high porosity is formed, which is easily destroyed by mechanical action. An increase in the volume fraction of the metal binder (NiCr or Co) leads to a redistribution of the sizes of carbides towards smaller values. In the second part of the paper, the results of cold spraying nickel-chromium alloy particles and cermet particles of the TiC - NiCr composition on an aluminum substrate are presented. Produced NiCr coatings have a high porosity (up to 10 %) and a layered structure with clearly defined contours of individual deformed particles ( splats). Due to the high hardness and low plasticity of metal - ceramic particles of the TiC - NiCr composition, during their interaction with the surface of aluminum substrate, continuous coating cannot be produced, only individual adhered particles are observed. With prolonged exposure to the flow of such particles, erosion of the substrate takes place.","[Kosarev, V. F.; Klinkov, S., V; Chesnokov, A. E.; Smirnov, A., V; Shikalov, V.

The following question arises: What is the impact of these forces on an ensemble of a thousand particles in continuous media? The aim of this work is to find analytical expressions of the radiation force and potential densities arising from a laser pulse propagating in dielectric media. This allows us to find an effective averaged longitudinal real force at the level of the laser pulse spot. The force obtained is proportional to the initial pulse energy and inversely proportional to its time duration. In the femtosecond region, the force becomes strong enough to confine neutral particles into the pulse envelope and translate them with the group velocity in gases. In solids, as silica for example, the longitudinal force of a femtosecond pulse is significantly greater than the molecular forces. Thus, the fine ablation in silica with short pulses may be due to this longitudinal force, which breaks down the molecular bonds. Additionally, after confinement into the pulse envelope, the moving particles produce new linear and nonlinear effects.","[Kovachev, L.

The main problem of mathematical modeling in oncology today is the heterogeneity of a typical malignant neoplasm. In this work, we propose a chemomechanical model of the pattern formation of small groups of cancer cells of invasive carcinoma of a non-special type (IC NST). The model assumes that carcinoma is a heterogeneous formation, which consists of cells of different phenotypes performing different tasks to maintain the existence of the tumor. In the model, each cell is represented as a deformable polygon that changes its shape and size as the tissue develops. Numerical modeling implements various subtypes of IC NST structures. These patterns are compared with morphological structures identified in clinical studies.","[Krasnyakov, I., V; Bratsun, D.

Experiments have shown that an increase in the concentration of the NaCl salt in the water solution reduces the intensity of vibrations when the sensor is removed from the ultrasonic source. The maximum intensity of cavitation events also changes its position, moving to the area near the ultrasonic source.

To bring MPC into practice, controllers and models are needed, that automatically adapt their behavior to the controlled system. In this work, such a self-adjusting MPC applicable to heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is developed. The MPC is based on a simple grey-box model that is able to cover the general dynamics of the considered subsystem. The controller adapts the model parameters online according to the past measurements of the controlled system using a moving horizon estimation. The developed self-adjusting MPC is applied to three heating coils in a simulation. Compared with a PID controller, the self-adjusting MPC is able to increase the control quality up to 10 %, while no manual tuning is needed. Additionally, the model predictive approach is able to reduce the power consumption of the pump by 80 %.","[Kuempel, Alexander; Stoffel, Phillip; Muller, Dirk] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, E ON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany","Kumpel, A (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, E ON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",akuempel@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,,,BMWi (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy) [03ETW006A],"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the BMWi (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy), promotional reference 03ETW006A.",,17,0,0,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12037,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012037,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100037,,gold,,,2022-07-14

Previous studies on outdoor human thermal comfort highlighted that apart from the microclimate conditions, the psychological and physiological factors play an important role in human thermal comfort. The influence of environmental quality on human thermal comfort is being examined in this paper. A survey with a total of 1842 thermal comfort responses was conducted during a hot summer in Hong Kong. Perceived aesthetic and acoustic quality votes are strongly associated with Thermal Sensation Votes (TSV). Thermal Comfort Votes (TCV) in the satisfied aesthetic group and the satisfied acoustic group are significantly higher than that in the not satisfied group. A sensation of comfort was confirmed by 39.8% and 38.4% of participants in the satisfied aesthetic group and the satisfied acoustic group, while only 22.2% and 23.9% of the members of the not satisfied group felt comfortable. The study suggested that the perceived environmental qualities are highly associated with thermal sensation and thermal comfort, and a beautiful and quiet environment can improve the thermal comfort and thermal tolerance.","[Lau, Kevin Ka-Lun; Choi, Chun Yin] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Future Cities, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lau, Kevin Ka-Lun] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, CUHK Jockey Club Inst Ageing, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lau, Kevin Ka-Lun] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Environm Energy & Sustainabil, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Lau, KKL (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Future Cities, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Lau, KKL (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, CUHK Jockey Club Inst Ageing, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Lau, KKL (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Environm Energy & Sustainabil, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",kevinlau@cuhk.edu.hk,,,,,,11,0,0,2,2,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12047,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012047,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100047,,gold,,,2022-07-14

Barium hexaferrite particles were stabilized with two layers of surfactant. The first layer consisted of oleic acid molecules. Second layer was a mix of sodium lauryl sulfate and lauric acid in a ratio 1/1. The process of particle magnetization was investigated by observing the effect of birefringence. The intensity of light passing through the system of crossed polaroids and the time of its establishment were measured depending on the magnitude of the magnetic field and the concentration of the components of the liquid crystal. It was found that the field dependence of the birefringence effect changes significantly depending on the concentration of the liquid crystal. In a concentrated solution in the liquid-crystalline phase, a significant enhancement of the birefringence effect is observed in weak fields. As the concentration of the solution decreases, the field dependence of the birefringence effect smoothly transforms into the curve for particles dispersed in water.","[Lebedev, A., V] Inst Continuous Media Mech, Korolev Str 1, Perm, Russia; [Lysenko, S.

A specific feature of this water body is the significant variability of its hydrological regime. During the summer dry season, it is characterized by low flow velocities. In winter, with a decrease in the water level in the reservoir, a typical river regime is observed. In addition, there is a strong technogenic impact on the water body. The impact is formed largely due to non-declared dispersed (diffuse) sources. Their characteristic feature is high mineralization and, accordingly, the density of the formed wastewater. Their behavior is fundamentally different from the processes of dilution and migration of effluents with neutral buoyancy. A two-layer structure is formed, when the content of the main ions in the surface horizon is more than an order of magnitude less than in the bottom layer. This circumstance must be taken into account when assessing the reliability of the functioning of water intakes. The most effective tool for solving such problems is the conjugation of a complex of field monitoring observations with computational experiments using hydrodynamic models in one-, two- and three-dimensional formulations.","[Lepikhin, A.

The results of measurements and simulations pointed out the advantages of bilaterally illuminated classrooms when compared to unilaterally illuminated ones. In winter, the windows placed on two opposite walls provide a significantly higher uniformity of daylight. In summer, in addition to the improved uniformity, this window arrangement offers higher variability in shading strategies, resulting in greater availability of daylight and better visual comfort.

However, the significantly different behavior of such networks compared to conventional district heating and cooling networks has not yet been comprehensively investigated. This paper provides a compilation of instrinsic characteristics of prosumer-dominated thermal networks and discusses challenges that arise from these characteristics. As a basis for the investigations an underlying reference concept for the considered type of networks is described. Simulative case studies are combined with scientific deduction and literature references to gain new insights on the design and operation of this type of networks. It is found that due to the variability in these networks, the definition of a design case is a challenge for the dimensioning of concrete network implementations. To anticipate the strong coupling between prosumers and the nonlinear network behavior, it is concluded that centralized control combined with a model of the physical network behavior is necessary. The discussion of characteristics and challenges in prosumer-dominated thermal networks indicates open points in this field and thus provides a starting point for consecutive studies.","[Licklederer, Thomas; Zinsmeister, Daniel; Elizarov, Ilya; Peric, Vedran; Tzscheutschler, Peter] Tech Univ Munich, Munich Sch Engn MSE, Lichtenbergstr 4a, D-85748 Garching, Germany","Licklederer, T (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Munich Sch Engn MSE, Lichtenbergstr 4a, D-85748 Garching, Germany.",thomas.licklederer@tum.de,,"Licklederer, Thomas/0000-0002-9525-418X","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy BMWi [FKZ: 03ET1413B, FKZ: 03EN3032A]; German Research Association DFG [450821044]",The research for this paper was founded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy BMWi (FKZ: 03ET1413B and FKZ: 03EN3032A) and the German Research Association DFG (project nr. 450821044).,,7,0,0,0,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12039,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012039,,7,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100039,,gold,,,2022-07-14

Under certain rheological parameters, this model is reduced to a Newtonian fluid model, the behavior of which is also investigated as a limit case. Based on the results of the calculations, the dependence of the maximum value of the stream function in the cavity on the Rayleigh number is plotted and the evolution of the unyielded zones with an increase in the Rayleigh number is traced. The threshold value of the Rayleigh number, at which a sharp growth of the flow intensity is observed, has been determined.

The research instrument is a test instrument for the basic competency test of learning technology, and a non-test instrument in the form of a learning technology capability questionnaire. The results showed that the average percentage of student learning technology competence in three tertiary institutions in Makassar was level 1 with a percentage of 94.39%; level 2 57.50%; level 3 78.17%; level 4 67.77%; level 5 76.03%; and level 6 67.55%. This shows that the competency of student learning technology for level 1 is in the very good category, and levels 3 and 5 are in the good category. While at level 4, and 6 are in the medium category, while at level 2 it is still in the bad category. The initial ability of learning technology on the attitude aspect is in the high category while the social emotional aspect is also in the moderate category. This shows that the use of learning technology really needs special attention to the social emotional aspects, especially ethics. Therefore, it can be said that the relationship between the initial ability of student learning technology and its use as a medium for learning basic physics is very close.

The Rb-87 cell was heated to around 75 degrees C and it was optically pumped with polarized light (range 750-850 nm), tuned to the D1 transition of rubidium, for spin-polarization of the atoms, and the intensity of the light transmitted through the cell was detected using a photodiode. Without magnetic field, the photodiode current is maximized but when a small transverse magnetic field is present a measurable drop in light transmission occurs. A Magnetic Shielded Box (MSB) made by a nickel-iron ferromagnetic alloy, was used for nulling background magnetic fields and the transmittance light versus transverse magnetic field intensity (100-1000 nT) was measured.","[Maciel, M.

Occupancy sensors are highly promoted by the building codes as one of the most cost-effective solutions in the sector. However, widespread use of these systems is still limited due to lack of user satisfaction. In this study, it is hypothesized that the conventional use of occupancy sensors (where user steps inside a dark area, and only afterwards the area becomes lit) is the reason behind the dissatisfaction. To overcome this problem, a new user-centric sensor-based lighting control approach is proposed in this study where users walk into an already lit area. An experiment was carried out in the circulation areas of a university building to test the feasibility of the proposed scenarios along with a conventional occupancy sensor scenario and the existing no sensor scenario. The main results revealed that the conventional use of occupancy sensors was not favoured by the participants in circulation areas while use of the proposed user-centric approach was as favourable as the existing constantly lit situation. It is the claim of this study that both energy efficiency and user satisfaction can be provided by the use of user-centric control systems.","[Madan, O.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) from literature are used to evaluate the control. It is shown that although the controllers differ in their control output time-series, their overall performance profile along the entire simulation run follows a similar pattern (KPI percent error varies between 3% and 8%).

In this paper we couple Moordyn to SIMPACK which is a multibody system simulation software. Afterwards, we verify the coupling by comparing the results to OpenFAST v2.1. The IEA Wind 15 MW reference wind turbine coupled to Activefloat and WindCrete floaters, introduced in COREWIND project, are used for the verification process. The two floaters have two different mooring configurations; WindCrete is a spar floater with a symmetric delta shape catenary mooring line system, while Activefloat is a semi-submersible with simple catenary mooring configurations. During the verification, both steady and dynamic load cases are used for the responses of two mooring systems. After the verification, the coupling procedure is open access and can be used to model new innovations in FOWTs using SIMPACK benefiting from the tool's flexibility.","[Mahfouz, M.

Flexoelectricity is an electromechanical effect that can result in deformation of a material due to a polarization gradient and can outperform piezoelectric effects at the nano scale. The flexoelectric constant is linearly dependent on the permittivity and therefore we determined TiO2 as a suitable flexoelectric material because of its high permittivity, its CMOS compatability and its linearity with respect to polarization. TiO2 capacitors with various electrode materials are evaluated in order to achieve the c-axis oriented (110) rutile growth, thus to exploit the highest permittivity. The permittivity ranges from 65 to 95, with TiO2 on IrO2 electrodes representing the highest value achieved in this study.

Results show that the compactness of the urban fabric contributes to reducing indoor building temperatures. The analysis suggests that the increased density of shadow areas can mitigate the outdoor temperature values and reduce direct radiation on facades. When comparing the two climate scenarios 2020 and 2050, average indoor temperatures increase in the latter. However, the analysis highlights that the absence of insulation and the relatively high thermal mass of typical Venetian envelopes plays a crucial role in the building thermal processes preserving indoor comfort in a warmer climate future.","[Maiullari, D.] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Urbanism, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands; [Gherri, B.; Finizza, C.; Maretto, M.; Naboni, E.] Univ Parma, Dept Engn & Architecture DIA, Parco Area Sci 181A, I-43124 Parma, Italy; [Naboni, E.] Royal Danish Acad Fine Arts, Inst Architecture & Technol, Sch Architecture Design & Conservat, Philip de Langes 10, DK-1435 Copenhagen K, Denmark","Maiullari, D (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Dept Urbanism, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.",,,,,,,15,0,0,1,2,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12060,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012060,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100060,,gold,,,2022-07-14

According to our previous investigations, it is possible to induce chirality in an amorphous azopolymer with a high linear photoanisotropy by illumination with elliptically polarized light. In the present work, we studied the photoinduced chirality in thin nanocomposite films based on the azopolymer poly[1-[ 4-(3-carboxy-4-hydroxyphenylazo)benzenesulfonamido]-1,2-ethanediyl, sodium salt], shortly PAZO, doped with TiO2 nanoparticles with a size of about 20 nm. The thickness of the prepared films was approximately 550 nm and the concentration of the nanoparticles varied from 0 to 3 wt. %. A He-Cd laser beam (lambda = 442 nm) was used, with the input ellipticity varying from -1 (left circularly polarized) to +1 (right circularly polarized). The ellipticity was set using a quarterwave and a half-wave plates. We studied the dependences of the output ellipticity and the angle of self-rotation of the polarization azimuth on the input ellipticity. Based on the experimental data obtained, we could analyze the dependence of the self-rotation of the polarization azimuth on the concentration of the nanoparticles. The results show that small concentrations of nanoparticles lead to an enhancement of the self-rotation, hence, the chirality.","[Mateev, G.; Nedelchev, L.; Nazarova, D.; Blagoeva, B.; Berberova-Buhova, N.; Stoykova, E.] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Opt Mat & Technol, Acad G Bonchev Str,Bl 109, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria; [Nedelchev, L.] Univ Telecommun & Post, 1 Acad Stefan Mladenov Str, Sofia 1700, Bulgaria","Mateev, G (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Opt Mat & Technol, Acad G Bonchev Str,Bl 109, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria.",g_mateev@iomt.bas.bg,,,National Science Fund of Bulgaria [KP-06-N38/15]; Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science [D01-284/17.12.2019],"This work was financially supported by contract KP-06-N38/15 with the National Science Fund of Bulgaria.

The sensitivity of the three parameterizations to wake development is analyzed. The older version of the WFP is also included to account for differences between versions in terms of wake length and intensity, and TKE production and advection. Finally, the impacts of upstream wind farms are studied through a series of simulations where they are disabled and the increases in power at downstream farms are quantified. These results and the adopted methodology have direct application and are highly relevant for the feasibility assessment of new wind farms in the shadow of other existing ones.","[Mayol, M.

The study looks at two different design methods that might be used within larger wind farm system design optimization (i.e. lay-out, electrical systems, etc.). The first consists of a scaling tool that scales a detailed design according to the rated power, water depth, hub height and rotor diameter. The second is a physics-based optimization approach that relies on the WISDEM (R) design tool. This research compares the results of these two methods for the design of both the tower and monopile of the IEA 10-MW and 15-MW reference wind turbines at a range of sea depths (25 m, 30 m, 35 m, 40m). The two tools yield very similar results in terms of monopile base diameter, support structure natural frequency and mass. WISDEM is then used to also investigate the sensitivity of the design to the tower top forces, wave conditions and the soil conditions. It is shown that tower top forces dominate the design. In general, large diameter structures can carry additional costs associated with manufacturing and transportation requirements. Thus, the paper is concluded with a trade-off study between mass and diameter that quantifies the effect of the reduction in monopile diameter with the increase in structural mass.","[McWilliam, Michael K.; Natarajan, Anand; Pollini, Nicolo; Dykes, Katherine] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark","McWilliam, MK (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",mimc@dtu.dk,"Pollini, Nicolò/N-8816-2019; Natarajan, Anand/C-5517-2011","Pollini, Nicolò/0000-0001-8504-6005; Natarajan, Anand/0000-0001-6850-0798; Dykes, Katherine/0000-0002-5734-3122",,,,25,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2018.0,,,,,,,,12025,10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/012025,,13,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Mechanical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BS3LW,WOS:000713005900025,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-07-14

Factors like current electricity price, grid code compliance, and maintenance costs will affect operational decision. Therefore, it is expected that plant control strategies will trade different control objectives while respecting the industrial practice, where the different levels in the hierarchy may be provided by different equipment vendors. This work proposes a plant controller that aims to track an operator power command at the WPP level and to reject low-frequency loading due to turbulent winds at individual turbines. The plant control respects the hierarchy in which the turbine-level controller takes precedence, interacting only via power set-point commands to each turbine. The control algorithm is based on parallel control loops along with look-up tables and gain scheduling, and its simplicity and effectiveness make it well-suited for industrial applications. Preliminary simulation results with a 32-turbine WPP indicate that there is a significant synergy effect by coordinating operation of the turbines in a plant. Structural loads can be reduced on certain turbines without excessively burdening the others, while an accurate plant-wide power tracking is still provided.","[Merz, Karl; Chabaud, Valentin; Garcia-Rosa, Paula B.; Kolle, Konstanze] SINTEF Energy Res, Sem Saelands Vei 11, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway","Merz, K (corresponding author), SINTEF Energy Res, Sem Saelands Vei 11, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway.",Karl.Merz@sintef.no,,,European Union [727680]; Norwegian Research Council [268044/E20],"This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement No. 727680, and the Norwegian Research Council and the industrial partners of OPWIND: Operational Control for Wind Power Plants (grant no. 268044/E20).",,23,0,0,0,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2018.0,,,,,,,,12026,10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/012026,,12,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Mechanical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BS3LW,WOS:000713005900026,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-07-14

In order to achieve stable rotation, the yoke equipped ring type rotor is proposed. The ring type permanent magnet equipped the yoke is used of this rotor. The change in the flux when the gap between the yoke and the permanent magnet, the yoke thickness and the width are changed is considered. As each value increases, the flux amount increases. As the gap between the yoke and the permanent magnet increases, the flux distribution is more concentrated to the outer part of the HTS. Considering the overall diameter, the boundary where the increasing rate decreases is adopted as the optimum value. In the yoke thickness and the width, the minimum value where the magnetic saturation is not observed is adopted as the optimum value. As a result, the magnetic circuit that the flux is concentrated to the outer part of the HTS is designed.

The geology of Kupang is located on the Batu Gamping Koral Formation which composed by coral limestone, which is physically barren and dry. So that local residents often have some problems with water availability. Therefore, needed the information about potential and depth of groundwater aquifers in the area. Measurement of the Wenner configuration 2D resistivity method has been carried out to identify the subsurface to determine the potential for groundwater. Inversion were performed using the method of Least-Square Smoothness Constraint. The result of the interpretation shows that the subsurface resistivity value in the area ranges from 0.4-13.108 Omega m, and groundwater aquifer potential lies at trajectories KPG 01, 02, 03, 04, 14, 15.

Passing the exhaled air through the corona discharge area results in the aerosol droplets charging and their further transferring by electrostatic force into a water surface, where they accumulate forming an adsorbed layer. Additionally, ALF samples were collected using a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The surface properties of the PS obtained by both methods have been examined using the capillary wave method, which was previously modified by the authors specifically for biomedical applications. Significant difference was found in the results obtained with ESAT and BAL in the group of healthy subjects, which can be explained by different origin of the samples obtained by these techniques.

It appears that the analysis of the data is compex because of specific geometry problems, presence of noise at different scales, and data gaps. In this study, the algorithm for analysis of a surface instantaneous profiles formed due to capillary waves propogating is proposed. It was found that the noise and the useful signal have different scales. Moreover, the structure of the useful signal is defined, and therefore it becomes possible to study the noise part of the signal and the patterns of the useful signals. On the basis of the preliminary knowledge about the signal structure, the algorithm has been developed to overcome the above mentioned problems.

The EDSL Tas simulation tool was used to assess the thermal performance and energy savings in the proposed model compared with traditional houses and modern typical houses, in two different climatic zones. The proposed climateresilient house has materials and design strategies derived from vernacular architecture, in addition to the use of thermal insulation. The results show that the proposed house is more climate-resilient compared to modern houses. In cold winter and hot summer climates, the proposed model presents a total annual heating and cooling energy consumption of 59% less than typical modern houses, and 5% more than old buildings.

The classification model is based on four pre-defined urban classes, that is, Centre, Urban, Suburban, and Rural for the entire region. The resolution is a grid of 500 m x 500 m. The features for classification include (1) dwelling geometric attributes (e.g. garden size, building footprint area, building perimeter), (2) street networks (e.g. street length, street density, street connectivity), (3) dwelling density (number of housing units per hectare), (4) building residential types (detached, semi-detached, terraced, and flats), and (5) characteristics of the surrounding neighbourhoods. The classification results, with overall average accuracy of 80% (accuracy per class: Centre: 38%, Urban 91%, Suburban 83%, and Rural 77%), for the Arc region show that the most important variables were three characteristics of the surrounding area: residential footprint area, dwelling density, and number of private gardens.

Given the variety of households, such profiles are difficult to capture. This study explores the possibility to predict domestic hot water (DHW) usage. Such prediction is made challenging due to the presence of two components in the signal, the first one bound to the physical properties of the DHW distribution system, the second one bound to the human patterns related to DHW consumption. Our contributions include (1) the analysis of recurrent neural network architectures based on GRU, (2) the inclusion of state-based labels inferred in an unsupervised way to simulate domain knowledge, (3) the comparison of different features. Results show that the physical contribution in the signal can be forecasted successfully across households.

To maximize self-consumption - minimizing the import of grid electricity - PV can be coupled with a hydrogen storage system converting the electricity to hydrogen by electrolysis during the summer season, when the on-site production is higher, and using it during the winter season with fuel cells. This article deals with the sizing constraints of solar hydrogen systems at building-scale. The future building for the Smart Living Lab (SLL) in Fribourg (Switzerland) has been taken as case study. It has four stories and a mixed usage (Office-building and Research facilities), with a multi-oriented PV installation in order to produce enough electricity to achieve at least 50% of self-sufficiency. Using the PV production, this study aims to optimise the sizing of a hydrogen storage system allowing to reach the required self-sufficiency ratio.

The instrument used was a written test consisting of 30 simple multiple-choice questions for three aspects of scientific literacy, which were scientific knowledge, scientific competencies, and attitudes toward science. The data analysis used Rasch Analysis Model (RAM) and assisted by Winsteps 4.4.5. The results being discussed are the person and item reliability, variable maps, and differential item functioning (DIF). The results show that the average scientific literacy ability of students falls into the low category, and some questions have gender biases.

Training held to improve the pedagogic and professional competence of physics teachers both by the training organizers and the deliberation of subject teachers is generally still conducted face-to-face, even though the teacher has limited time and place in following it. This happens because the teacher also has to carry out his main task of teaching, so we need a training strategy that can be accessed by teachers anywhere and anytime. The purpose of this study is to find out the reasons why in the process of developing pedagogic and professional teachers need learning strategies that are based on hybrid learning. This research method is descriptive qualitative using data collection techniques in the form of interviews, documentation studies, and questionnaires for teacher needs in the implementation of training. The results obtained based on interviews with the training providers showed that the implementation of the pedagogical and professional teacher improvement training was still conducted face-to-face. Meanwhile, the results of the questionnaire distributed to 45 physics teachers showed that most of the teachers stated that they needed training to improve pedagogic and professional competencies, which facilitated the teacher's training in the form of combining face-to-face and online. This can be done by implementing a hybrid learning training strategy, because in hybrid learning we can combine face-to-face and online training.","[Mulhayatiah, D.] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Sekolah Pascasarjana, Program Studi Pendidikan IPA, Jl Setiabudhi 229, Bandung 40154, Indonesia; [Sinaga, P.; Rusdiana, D.; Kaniawati, I] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Dept Pendidikan Fis, Jl Setiabudhi 229, Bandung 40154, Indonesia; [Suhendi, H.

The method used is a Focus Group Discussion (FGD), which involves experts from physics education, linguists, management, and early education. There are several important points that became the result of the FGD, including (1) physics logic must be made simpler that is easy to understand (2) Mathematical formula which becomes a symbol language does not need to be introduced first. Language skills are needed to understand physics and communicate it (3) Through the right approach, method and media, learning that is delivered by the teacher will make early childhood more literate with physics. This research concludes that physics is possible to be taught in early childhood. We, therefore, recommend that early childhood teachers collaborate with physics teachers in planning, implementing, and evaluating physics learning.","[Nasrudin, D.] UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung, Dept Phys Educ, Jl AH Nasut 105, Bandung, Indonesia; [Fitriyanti, N.] Telkom Univ, Dept Phys Engn, Jl Telekomunikasi 1, Bandung, Indonesia; [Muhtar, S.

The theoretical analysis, simulation and experimental testing show that for appropriately chosen parameters and for a suitably composed interference complex such structures can achieve a controlled variable transmission in a wide range (99% - similar to 30%) and reflection from similar to 2% to similar to 70%. The traditional realization of purely glass splitters ensures no more than similar to 20% reflectivity. The splitters proposed are very compact sheet-like elements (e.g., 5x3x0.2 cm) and the splitting is implemented by sliding in the splitter's plane. Thus, the propagation direction of the formed beams is preserved. The incident beam on the purely glass splitter (no dielectric or metallic mirrors) can be of high power and the influence of the air humidity is strongly reduced; also, cleaning the filter surfaces presents no difficulties. A single splitter can work in a wide range of wavelengths (IR, visible) without polarization dependence for incident angles up to similar to 20 degrees.","[Nenchev, M.; Deneva, M.; Marinova, M.] Tech Univ Sofia, Quantum & Optoelect Lab, R&D Div, Plovdiv Branch, 25 Tsanko Dyustabanov Str, Plovdiv 4000, Bulgaria","Deneva, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Sofia, Quantum & Optoelect Lab, R&D Div, Plovdiv Branch, 25 Tsanko Dyustabanov Str, Plovdiv 4000, Bulgaria.",deneva@tu-plovdiv.bg,"Deneva, Margarita/AAE-5002-2022",,Bulgarian National Science Fund [DN 17/7],The work is supported by Bulgarian National Science Fund under project/ DN 17/7 (2017).,,7,0,0,1,3,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1859.0,,,,,,,,12021,10.1088/1742-6596/1859/1/012021,,6,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Quantum Science & Technology; Optics; Physics, Applied",Engineering; Physics; Optics,BS2DU,WOS:000700377600021,,gold,,,2022-07-14

Pulses with picosecond and femtosecond duration are very well described by the NSE, but it does not work for attosecond and phase-modulated femtosecond laser pulses, where the spectral width of the pulse is of the order of the carrying frequency. In such cases, it is more convenient to use the general nonlinear amplitude equation (NAE). During the propagation of ultra-short pulses in optical fibers, the effects of the third-order linear dispersion and dispersion of nonlinearity become significant and have to be taken into account. We expanded the NAE by including these two effects.

The basic idea behind this filtering is to initially decompose the light signal of each pixel of the raw images, both for the left and the right cameras, with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The signal is then reconstructed with the Inverse FFT by keeping the zero-order harmonic and the first harmonic and just discarding all the others, which only introduce noise contributions. The down-sampling approach is also used in combination with this filtering to reach high loading frequencies, even without (expensive) high-speed cameras, provided that a quite short exposure time is available. A cantilever aluminum plate was tested at 591 Hz, and a similar experiment was repeated on a bladed disk (or blisk) excited at high frequency, 6458 Hz, obtaining clear and smooth displacement maps even in the range of 10 microns. In the blisk application, a single blade with a significantly larger displacement amplitude was clearly observed, which could be interpreted as mistuning evidence.","[Neri, P.; Paoli, A.; Razionale, A., V; Santus, C.] Univ Pisa, Dept Civil & Ind Engn, Pisa, Italy","Neri, P (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Civil & Ind Engn, Pisa, Italy.",paolo.neri@dici.unipi.it,"Razionale, Armando Viviano/C-2335-2018","Razionale, Armando Viviano/0000-0001-7110-3857",,,,18,0,0,3,3,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2041.0,,,,,,,,12008,10.1088/1742-6596/2041/1/012008,,9,"Mechanics; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing; Optics; Physics, Applied",Mechanics; Materials Science; Optics; Physics,BS4XT,WOS:000723958200008,,gold,,,2022-07-14

For that reason, wind turbine wakes have been studied intensively and different engineering wake models were derived. However, none of them is constructed from a few basic and robust assumptions, while such a formalism already exists for the axisymmetric turbulent wake. Therefore, we will apply these models to data obtained in a wind farm using a scanning LiDAR. The wakes of two wind turbines are analyzed in four different wind directions chosen so that their wakes will have different degrees of interaction. The axisymmetric wake models are found to perform better than the Jensen wake model, and the main source of improvement is shown to be the presence of a virtual origin. Indeed, a virtual origin is shown to also improve the Jensen wake model significantly. Overall, our results indicate that a view from classical axisymmetric wake theory can help to improve the understanding of the evolution of wind turbine wakes in the atmospheric boundary layer.","[Neunaber, Ingrid; Aubrun, Sandrine] Cent Nantes, CNRS, LHEEA, 1 Rue Noe, F-44300 Nantes, France; [Obligado, Martin] Grenoble INP, CNRS, LEGI, 46 Ave Felix Viallet, F-38031 Grenoble, France; [Peinke, Joachim] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Phys & ForWind, Kupkersweg 70, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany","Neunaber, I (corresponding author), Cent Nantes, CNRS, LHEEA, 1 Rue Noe, F-44300 Nantes, France.",ingrid.neunaber@ec-nantes.fr,"Peinke, Joachim/AAB-9194-2021","Peinke, Joachim/0000-0002-0775-7423", [ANR-14-CE050034];  [ANR-19-CE05-0034],"The data presented here was accumulated within the SMARTEOLE project (ANR-14-CE050034), and it is evaluated further within the MOMENTA project (ANR-19-CE05-0034).",,19,0,0,3,3,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1934.0,,,,,,,,12004,10.1088/1742-6596/1934/1/012004,,12,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Mechanical; Mechanics; Physics, Fluids & Plasmas",Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Mechanics; Physics,BS3JN,WOS:000712011500004,,gold,,,2022-07-14

The samples were subjected to fatigue tests under cyclic tension with constant amplitude. The test of each sample was stopped several times at different loading stages to execute experimental modal analysis and non-destructive inspection of the appeared defects. The found natural frequencies were used to solve the inverse problem of identifying the elastic parameters of the laminate monolayer: two Young's modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio. As a result, the dependences of these parameters on the relative fatigue life were obtained.

The composite films are obtained using a classical on-axis pulsed laser deposition technology, where the target consists of two sectors with different composition. Multicomponent films containing ZnO, TiO2, and Ag, are thus deposited on a substrate. The as-prepared composite films are then immersed in double distiled water and irradiated by nanosecond laser pulses. This results in the production of colloids composed by multicomponent nanoparticles. The optical properties of the colloids are evaluated by optical transmittance measurements in the UV-VIS spectral range. Transmission electron microscopy is used to visualize the nanostructures formed in the solution, as well as to evaluate their size distribution. The phase composition of the samples is determined by selected area electron diffraction.","[Nikov, Ro; Dikovska, A.; Nedyalkov, N.] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Elect, Tsarigradsko Chaussee 72, Sofia 1784, Bulgaria; [Nikova, T.; Karashanova, D.] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Opt Mat & Technol, G Bonchev St,Bl 109, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria; [Nikova, T.] Univ Architecture Civil Engn & Geodesy, 1 Hr Smirnenski Blvd, Sofia 1046, Bulgaria","Nikov, R (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Elect, Tsarigradsko Chaussee 72, Sofia 1784, Bulgaria.",rosen_nikov@abv.bg,,,Bulgarian National Science Fund [KP-06-N37/20],"The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Bulgarian National Science Fund, project KP-06-N37/20 Formation and physical properties of composite nanostructures of metal oxides and noble metals, under the Competition for Financial Support of Basic Research Projects - 2019.",,22,0,0,0,2,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1859.0,,,,,,,,12012,10.1088/1742-6596/1859/1/012012,,5,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Quantum Science & Technology; Optics; Physics, Applied",Engineering; Physics; Optics,BS2DU,WOS:000700377600012,,gold,,,2022-07-14

Both models also produce highly consistent estimates of coherence with different horizontal and vertical separations, which match well with Davenport and IEC coherence models at height of 180m and 140m respectively.

The typical parent Fe-based compound LaFe(As1-x'Px')O exhibits the re-emergent antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at x' similar to 0.6 (AFM2) separated from the parent AFM order at x' = 0 (AFM1). Systematic P-31-NMR study on [Sr4Sc2O6]Fe-2(As1-xPx)(2) (SrSc42622), which has local lattice parameters of iron-pnictogen (FePn) layer similar to the series of LaFe(As1-x'Px')O, also revealed that the presence of AFM1 order is universal for most of parent Fe-based compounds. In contrast, the static AFM2 order was absent in this series, however, the dynamical low-energy AFM spin fluctuations are enhanced at around x similar to 0.8, indicating that the onset of the static AFM2 is quite sensitive to the local lattice parameters of FePn layer. In order to elucidate the further universality and diversity, we have carried out Se-77-NMR measurement on Li-x(NH3)(y)Fe2-delta Se2 (T-c = 44 K) in heavily electron-doped regime. Although the spin fluctuations at low energies does not significantly develops upon cooling, the moderate spin fluctuations were extracted at high temperatures from comparison of the temperature (T) dependences of Knight shift and nuclear relaxation rate (1/T1T). We discuss the universality and diversity of the relationship between the T-c and the characteristics of the spin fluctuations in the Fe-based compounds from a microscopic point of the NMR measurements.","[Nishioka, S.; Kouchi, T.; Sakano, F.; Yashima, M.; Mukuda, H.] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn Sci, Osaka 5608531, Japan; [Yogi, M.] Univ Ryukyus, Fac Sci, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan; [Yamaura, K.; Takayama-Muromachi, E.] Natl Inst Mat Sci NIMS, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; [Miyasaka, S.; Tajima, S.] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Eisaki, H.; Iyo, A.] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan; [Kodani, M.; Kakuto, T.; Lee, J-H; Kambe, T.] Okayama Univ, Dept Engn, Okayama 7008530, Japan","Mukuda, H (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn Sci, Osaka 5608531, Japan.",mukuda@mp.es.osaka-u.ac.jp,"KAMBE, Takashi/B-2117-2011; Miyasaka, Shigeki/AAZ-9673-2020","Miyasaka, Shigeki/0000-0001-8535-9095; YAMAURA, Kazunari/0000-0003-0390-8244; Mukuda, Hidekazu/0000-0003-3783-2591; Nishioka, Sotaro/0000-0002-6728-4293","JSPS KAKENHI [16H04013, 18K18734]; Murata Science foundation; Mitsubishi foundation; Tanigawa fund","We thank K.

The widely used Mann spectral tensor model with inputs recommended by the standard, is compared to FitMann, the Mann model with inputs fitted to measurements and TIMESR; using measured time series combined with the Davenport coherence model. The Mann model produces too low energy levels at the lowest frequencies of the wind spectra, while the wind spectra generated by FitMann approaches the measured values. TIMESR reproduces the measured spectral values at all frequencies. The different models give similar vertical coherence, while the Mann and FitMann models give lower horizontal coherence than TIMESR. Investigating the wind loads on a bottom-fixed 10-MW wind turbine, the spectra for the tower bottom fore-aft and blade root flapwise bending moment follow the shape of the wind spectra closely at low frequencies. The low-frequency range is important for the blade root and in particular the tower bottom bending moment. Thus, the TIMESR model, followed by FitMann, is assumed to give the most accurate fatigue estimates. For the specific situation analysed in this study, the FitMann model gives only 18 and 5 % lower estimates than TIMESR of the tower bottom and blade root damage equivalent bending moments, while the Mann model gives 27 % and 12 % lower estimates. The tower top yaw and fore-aft bending moments depend on the wind coherence. For the specific situation analysed in this study, the FitMann model gives 9 and 5 % higher estimates of the tower top yaw and tower top damage equivalent (bending) moments compared to TIMESR, while the Mann model gives 23 % and 18 % higher estimates. Since only measurements of the vertical coherence are available, it is not clear which model is superior for the tower top moments. However, the importance of a proper coherence model is documented.","[Nybo, A.; Nielsen, F. G.; Godvik, M.] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Nybo, A.; Nielsen, F.

In this study, a basic geometry of a semi-submersible floater for 10MW is designed, based on which sensitivity study of the material property on floater design is conducted. It was found that minimum floater pitch angles achieved by selecting the optimum floater geometries were similar for the three types of material, while larger values of geometrical variables were required for concrete floaters than for steel floaters for a floater pitch limitation If larger wall thickness was to be required for concrete structures due to, for example, corrosion protection and crack limitation, generally larger side column width and lower hull length were required for concrete floaters. As the sensitivity of pitch angle to the wall thickness was more affected by wind excitation than wave excitation for normal concrete, it is indicated that the design space for the length of hull can be widened by combining the design with the wind turbine controller methods in the treatment of the maximum thrust force. Lightweight concrete had advantages over normal concrete in the lower center of gravity. The raw material cost of lightweight concrete was higher than normal concrete but significantly lower than steel floaters.","[Oh, Sho] ClassNK, Chiyoda Ku, 4-7 Kioicho, Tokyo, Japan","Oh, S (corresponding author), ClassNK, Chiyoda Ku, 4-7 Kioicho, Tokyo, Japan.",s-oh@classnk.or.jp,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2018.0,,,,,,,,12029,10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/012029,,10,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Mechanical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BS3LW,WOS:000713005900029,,gold,,,2022-07-14

Thus, we proposed a technique for the non-destructive measurement of the I-C of a high-temperature superconducting (HTS) RF-SQUID ring by evaluating the behaviour of the flux in superconducting thin films using a SQUID magnetometer. A superconducting ring sample with JJ was placed below the HTS SQUID magnetometer and cooled down to 77 K. The change in the SQUID output was monitored on application of the magnetic field. When increasing the field, the waveforms indicated that the screening current of the ring sample exceeded the I-C of the JJ, and the JJ became a normal-conducting state.

The authors precisely estimated the flux trapping property of the bulk samples, found that the flux-shielding effect closely attributed to the sample dimensions. The magnetic field capturing of Ti-5.0wt% sample reached the highest value of 0.76 T. The applied field which reached the centre of the sample surface shifted from 1.0 T to 1.2 T with increasing sample thickness from 3.67 mm to 5.80 mm. This means that the shielding effect was enhanced with increasing the sample thickness. Moreover, Ti-addition affected the frequency of flux jump happenings. The occurrence of flux jumps was suppressed in 5.0wt%Ti-added sample. This means that the heat capacity of the compounds was promoted by Ti addition.","[Oka, T.; Yamanaka, K.; Sudo, K.; Dadiel, L.; Sakai, N.; Miryala, M.; Murakami, M.] Shibaura Inst Technol, Koto Ward, 3-7-5 Toyosu, Tokyo 1358548, Japan; [Ogawa, J.] Niigata Univ, Nishi Ward, 8050 Ikarashi Ninocho, Niigata 9508151, Japan; [Yokoyama, K.] Ashikaga Univ, 268-1 Omae Cho, Ashikaga 3268558, Japan; [Haessler, W.] IFW Dresden, 20 Helmholtzstr, D-01069 Dresden, Germany; [Noudem, J.] Caen Univ, Me Louis Aragon BP78, F-50130 Octeville, France; [Berger, K.] Lorraine Univ, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France","Oka, T (corresponding author), Shibaura Inst Technol, Koto Ward, 3-7-5 Toyosu, Tokyo 1358548, Japan.",,"BERGER, Kévin/F-9074-2015; Dadiel, J.

Using a modelling approach, the expected heat load on a hypothetical 3U CubeSat with an HTS coil during a sun-synchronous low Earth orbit was predicted. The direction and magnitude of solar, albedo and infrared incident radiation toward the satellite was calculated for each orbital position of a circular 732 km, Omega = 0 degrees longitude of ascending node orbit. Using a finite element approach, the surface radiosity and temperature of the CubeSat was predicted and validated. Finally, the instantaneous heat load on the HTS magnet, which generates a 1T magnetic field, was calculated as a function of orbital position. This study provides technical information about the characteristics of the refrigeration device required to maintain cryogenic temperatures for an HTS coil on a space faring vessel, such as a portable cryocooler.

A cantilever plate made of a viscoelastic material is considered as a structure under study. The amplitude of displacements of the free end of the plate in resonance modes occurring at forced steady-state vibrations is considered as the mechanical response. Excitation of vibrations is realized by a harmonic movement applied to the clamped end of the plate. The control of the mechanical response within the framework of this work is supposed to be performed by supplying an electric signal to the piezoelectric element. This signal changes harmonically and has the form of a potential difference which changes according to a harmonic law. The magnitude of the vibration amplitude of the structure is determined numerically by the finite element method implemented in the ANSYS software package. The viscoelastic properties of the plate material are described according to the relations of hereditary theory of viscoelasticity in terms of complex dynamic moduli. Within the framework of this work, the relations between the mechanical response of the structure and the magnitude and polarity of the electric voltage applied to the piezoelectric element were obtained.

In boiling histotripsy, the formations and dynamics of a boiling vapour bubble and cavitation clouds contribute towards mechanical tissue fractionation. Whilst a number of numerical and experimental studies have been performed to examine and understand the evolution of a boiling bubble at the HIFU focus in a viscoelastic medium, little is known about the subsequent generation of cavitation clouds that form in between the boiling bubble and the HIFU transducer during boiling histotripsy insonation. Previous experimental observations suggest that the shock scattering by a boiling bubble may play a significant role in producing cavitation clouds. The main objective of the present study is, therefore, to investigate the relationship between the shock scattering phenomenon and the occurrence of cavitation clouds through (a) performing a numerical simulation of nonlinear wave propagation with the presence of a bubble at the HIFU focus and (b) comparing with the previous high speed camera observations of a cavitation cluster formation. The size of a bubble (i.e., 95.7, 128.1 and 258 mu m in diameter) as well as the HIFU exposure conditions (i.e., a driving frequency of 1.1 MHz, peak positive and negative pressures of 68.4 MPa and -13.9 MPa) used in the simulations were obtained from the previous boiling histotripsy experiments conducted with a tissue gel phantom.

A design space is explored for mooring configurations with different pretension ratios, laid down length ratios and clump weight sizes. Ultimate and fatigue load cases are simulated in Open-Fast to compute the floater motions, mooring line tensions and fatigue damage. With constant pretension ratio of 0.15 and adding clump weights of 40t, mooring line length, mooring footprint and peak tension can be reduced by 14%, 15% and 9% respectively, while maximum surge and fatigue damage increase by 25% and 12% respectively.

The simulation study of a non-segmented and segmented atrium of 250 m height reveals indoor air temperature, wind velocity contours and wind pressure coefficients at various heights of each atrium type. In a hot and humid climate like that of Singapore, the internal temperatures within each atrium stack remain constant at 27 degrees C. However, the wind velocity in the non-segmented atrium (of 0.5 - 0.7 m/s) is lower than acceptable (0.9 m/s) for human occupancy. Adding segments and a larger inlet to the atrium solves the problem of low wind velocity without increasing the effective ambient temperature within the atrium stack. Additionally, the segmented atrium offers the advantage of displaying lower buoyancy forces by lowering the pressure differential within a tall stack thereby providing better comfort conditions.","[Pawar, Priya; Lang, Werner] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Energy Efficient & Sustainable Design & Bldg, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Zhang, Deying; Wu, Xiaoying] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Architecture, Beijing, Peoples R China","Pawar, P (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Inst Energy Efficient & Sustainable Design & Bldg, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",priya.pawar@tum.de; 342928946@qq.com; wuxiaoyi16@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; w.lang@tum.de,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12162,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012162,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100162,,gold,,,2022-07-14

Recently, data-driven models are increasingly becoming popular in many branches of science and engineering due to their non-intrusive nature (i.e., they are equation-free) and online learning capability. Despite the robust performance of data-driven models, they are faced with challenges of poor generalizability and difficulty in interpretation. These challenges have encouraged the integration of physics-based models with data-driven models, herein denoted hybrid analysis and modeling (HAM). We propose two different frameworks under the HAM paradigm for applications relevant to wind energy in order to bring the physical realism within emerging digital twin technologies. The physics-guided machine learning (PGML) framework reduces the uncertainty of neural network predictions by embedding physics-based features from a simplified model at intermediate layers and its performance is demonstrated for the aerodynamic force prediction task. Our results show that the proposed PGML framework achieves approximately 75% reduction in uncertainty for smaller angle of attacks. The interface learning (IL) framework illustrates how different solvers can be coupled to produce a multi-fidelity model and is successfully applied for the Boussinesq equations that govern a broad class of transport processes. The IL approach paves the way for seamless integration of multi-scale, multi-physics and multi-fidelity models (M-3 models).","[Pawar, Suraj; Ahmed, Shady E.; San, Omer] Oklahoma State Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Rasheed, Adil] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Engn Cybernet, N-7465 Trondheim, Norway","Pawar, S (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",supawar@okstate.edu; shady.ahmed@okstate.edu; osan@okstate.edu; adil.rasheed@ntnu.no,"Pawar, Suraj/AAY-8109-2021","Pawar, Suraj/0000-0001-7562-799X",Department of Engineering Norwegian Research Council [268044/E20]; U.S. DOE Early Career Research Program [DE-SC0019290]; National Science Foundation [DMS-2012255],"The authors acknowledge the financial support from the Department of Engineering Norwegian Research Council, the industrial partners of OPWIND: Operational Control for Wind Power Plants (Grant No.: 268044/E20), the U.S. DOE Early Career Research Program (Award Number DE-SC0019290), and the National Science Foundation under Award Number DMS-2012255.",,24,0,0,8,10,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2018.0,,,,,,,,12031,10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/012031,,10,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Mechanical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BS3LW,WOS:000713005900031,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-07-14

However, their accuracy both to reproduce the wind speed and turbulent kinetic energy fields behind turbines is a matter of debate. Here, and to the authors knowledge for the first time for a single turbine, the inbuilt wind farm parametrization of the Weather Research and Forecasting model is evaluated using detailed large-eddy simulations of the wake performed with a generalized actuator disk model that was implemented in the same modeling system. Thus, a fairer evaluation is achieved compared to previous works, as we try to set the simulations as similar as possible within the same modeling framework. We find that both types of simulations can be used to provide similar inflow conditions to the turbine. Most importantly, by comparing the detailed-wake results, within the area where the turbine is placed, with the mesoscale results at the analogous position, velocity deficits can differ up to 50%. However, within the same area, the vertical profile of turbine-generated TKE is nearly identical between the two types of simulations. Our findings demonstrate that the generalized actuator disk implementation can provide us with a solid foundation for evaluation of wind farm parametrizations within weather models.","[Pena, Alfredo] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Wind Energy, Roskilde, Denmark; [Mirocha, Jeffrey D.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA","Pena, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Wind Energy, Roskilde, Denmark.",aldi@dtu.dk,,"Pena Diaz, Alfredo/0000-0002-7900-9651; Mirocha, Jeffrey/0000-0001-5914-6168",Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark,This work is partly funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark and administered by Danida Fellowship Centre through the 'Multi-scale and model-chain Evaluation of Wind Atlases' (MEWA) project.,,13,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1934.0,,,,,,,,12010,10.1088/1742-6596/1934/1/012010,,9,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Mechanical; Mechanics; Physics, Fluids & Plasmas",Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Mechanics; Physics,BS3JN,WOS:000712011500010,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-07-14

Various data sources exist at the pan-European level describing land use and built areas. Combined with statistical data, such maps have been used in previous research for estimating building energy performance aggregated at the hectare level, using engineering assumptions. In this paper, we show that large-scale land-use maps alone can be used for predicting annual building energy demand with an accuracy comparable to the one of previous engineering models. We hence present a preliminary method based on Convolutional Neural Networks at different spatial resolutions. The resulting model was trained and tested in an area of about 170 km(2) in Geneva (Switzerland) using a local annual heating demand dataset comprising 16239 buildings. On a 300-m aggregation tile, the obtained mean error (14.3%) is significantly reduced compared to the one of a simple linear model (37.2%).

The paper presents results of studying and analyzing the optical and microphysical properties of the aerosols detected, as well as the topological and dynamical features of the aerosol/dust layers observed. The height profiles of the atmospheric aerosol backscattering coefficient are retrieved and discussed. The microphysical properties of aerosol/dust particles are characterized qualitatively based on an analysis of the backscatter-related Angstrom exponents profiles and distributions obtained for particular aerosol layers. Dust mixing with other aerosol types of local origin or such captured during the transport is also considered and discussed based on local meteorological radiosonde data and air-transport modeling and forecasting data. Conclusions are drawn concerning the experimentally ascertained and the possible impacts of the massive dust intrusion event on the local tropospheric aerosol structure and meteorological conditions.","[Peshev, Z.

A four degree-of-freedom frequency-domain model is used for the dynamic response of a spar floating wind turbine subjected to wind and wave loads. The framework allows for design optimization involving the geometrical properties of the floater and the mooring system and inclusion of long realizations of multiple load cases in the analysis. The adopted optimization approach adopted relies on analytical design sensitivities of the governing frequency-domain equations and of the design requirements. This ensures that modern gradient-based optimization algorithms can effectively be used to solve the design problem at hand. The optimization approach is applied to the design of the spar-buoy floater and its mooring system for the IEA 15 MW reference wind turbine. A post-processing approach for identifying discrete designs from predefined catalogues is also presented. The post-processing allows to transform continuous design solutions into practical ones that can be used in subsequent analyses with time domain response models for the full validation of the design solutions obtained. The numerical results highlight the capability of the approach discussed herein to provide discrete optimized designs for given design constraints and loads in few minutes requiring modest computational resources and time.,"[Pollini, Nicolo; Dou, Suguang; Stolpe, Mathias] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Pegalajar-Jurado, Antonio; Bredmose, Henrik] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Nils Koppels Alle, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark","Pollini, N (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",nipol@dtu.dk; ampj@dtu.dk; sudou@dtu.dk; hbre@dtu.dk; matst@dtu.dk,"Dou, Suguang/AAH-3749-2019; Pollini, Nicolò/N-8816-2019; Stolpe, Mathias/B-3094-2010; Pegalajar-Jurado, Antonio/ABF-4299-2020","Dou, Suguang/0000-0002-8136-9437; Pollini, Nicolò/0000-0001-8504-6005; Stolpe, Mathias/0000-0002-5858-1595; Pegalajar-Jurado, Antonio/0000-0002-1374-5912; Bredmose, Henrik/0000-0001-6961-0753",Innovation Fund Denmark (IFD) [8055-00075B],This work was carried out as part of the FloatStep project.

Hence, teachers can get insight to implement and to develop CPS assessment mainly for training students to solve complex problems. Based on this review, there are two broad methods to measure CPS including using computer environment and real-life context. The former allows measurement to be more accurate and quicker, while the latter enables students to experience face-to-face interaction during problem solving. However, the development of CPS assessment using a computer needs professional ICT and an adequate number of computers as well as a high internet connection. In Indonesia, the implementation of computer-based assessment faces many challenges, and only some schools in the city centre can meet that requirement. Hence, it can be an alternative to measure the interaction of students during the CPS activity by putting high consideration of the using pedagogical content to facilitate CPS environment.","[Putri, I.

QCM sensors can be applied as chemical sensors and gas sensors. To increase its sensitivity and selectivity, QCM must be coated with active ingredients, one of which is Polyaniline (Pani). There are several methods for the Pani layer deposition above QCM. In this study, the evaporative deposition method was carried out. The purpose of this study was to analyse the effect of deposition time on the thickness and impedance value of the Pani layer. Before being coated by Pani, QCM was given a polystyrene coating to increase its adhesion. The variation of deposition time used was 10; 15; 30 and 60 seconds. The characterization carried out was measured the impedance of the layer by using an impedance analyser, observing the layer morphology by using an optical microscope, and determining the thickness of the layer using the Saurbrey equation approach. The results showed that the longer the deposition time caused the Pani layer to be deposited thicker and had a more even morphology. The layer impedance value was also getting bigger. The maximum thickness obtained at the deposition time of 60 seconds was 32.21 mu m with a layer impedance value of 891.57 Omega With a huge impedance value, the Pani layer provides a substantial damping effect on QCM.","[Putri, N.

The choice of layers used in the assembly impacts the heat loss and gain through the wall structure and potentially can affect the comfort indoors. Thus, the building envelope plays an essential role in the thermal performance of the building. Optimizing the cladding design in the envelope has recently become increasingly important to reach sustainable development strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This paper aims to analyze several cladding types used on the EPFL campus in Lausanne and compare their impact on the energy performance of the building envelopes. The building assemblies constructed on the EPFL campus in different years vary in composition and thermo-physical properties of the layers used. The impact of these parameters on the thermal performance of the wall assembly is evaluated by comparing the variation of heat flux and temperature fluctuations within the wall structure. The results obtained highlight the importance of the building envelope layers and materials used in the wall structure. Due to the variations in the thermal inertia of different wall assemblies, a time shift of more than 3 hours in the transient response of the building envelope to the fluctuation of the outdoor weather conditions is observed.","[Rahiminejad, Mohammad; Berquand, Cecile; Khovalyg, Dolaana] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Thermal Engn Built Environm Lab TEBEL, Lausanne, Switzerland","Rahiminejad, M (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Thermal Engn Built Environm Lab TEBEL, Lausanne, Switzerland.",mohammad.rahiminejad@epfl.ch,,,,,,8,0,0,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12080,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012080,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100080,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-07-14

Cure monitoring of the polymer matrix of fibre composites during the fabrication can be realized with interdigital sensors. The measured impedance can be directly related to the curing process. However wiring the sensor may disrupt the material, therefore sensing should be done wireless. As many fibre composites are processed under high temperature and high pressure conditions no electronics can be used inside the material. Here we present the design, fabrication, and characterization of a wireless sensory system using a chipless strategy for online cure monitoring. For this purpose, different combinations of sensors and readers are designed, consisting of a planar inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, where capacitance is an interdigital capacitor, and an inductor as antenna operating wirelessly through inductive coupling. The designs are realized onto flexible polyimide substrate using microfabrication technology. To characterize the coupling effect, the response of the reader antenna has been carried out when sensor is placed in its vicinity. Furthermore, the curing process of adhesive is demonstrated and results are discussed. It is shown that the curing process of a thermoset polymer can be monitored by a flexible chipless LC resonator wirelessly.","[Rajawat, Sapna; Kempen, Ludger] Hsch Bremen Univ Appl Sci, Bremen, Germany; [Huebner, Martina; Lang, Walter] Univ Bremen, Inst Microsensors Actuators & Syst IMSAS, Bremen, Germany; [Lang, Walter] Univ Bremen, Microsyst Ctr Bremen, Bremen, Germany","Hubner, M (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Inst Microsensors Actuators & Syst IMSAS, Bremen, Germany.",mhuebner@imsas.uni-bremen.de,,,German Research Foundation (DFG) [LA 1471/17-1],This work was partially funded by German Research Foundation (DFG) within the project LA 1471/17-1).,,12,1,1,3,4,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1837.0,,,,,,,,12001,10.1088/1742-6596/1837/1/012001,,6,Mechanics,Mechanics,BR6XM,WOS:000664529400001,,gold,,,2022-07-14

The model allows the inclusion of standard ancillary equipment such as bend stiffeners, buoyancy modules, clamps and tethers in order to simulate multiple configurations: double hanging, single hanging (catenary), lazy wave, steep wave and tethered wave. The external actions considered are marine growth and currents and the main cable properties are taken into account to calculate its weight, buoyancy, tensions, moments and drag forces.

This work focuses on diarisation of conversations that might be recorded via a drone-mounted LDV by reducing the effect of external noise, extracting useful features from frames of audio and clustering them into homogenous segments based on speaker identity. The two-step noise reduction (TSNR) technique was introduced to these vibroacoustic data for the first time and tested against Gaussian bandpass filtering for noise reduction from sources such as laser speckle and additional broadband 'white' noise. Feature extraction was then performed using a time-delay neural network, with the grouping of frames to a particular speaker tested with various clustering methods. Each noise reduction and clustering technique combination were tested on a twospeaker conversation recorded via the LDV. In the case of no added noise, the most effective combination was found to be the TSNR/Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) combination with a diarisation error rate of 6.13%. In the case of additional broadband noise, the most effective combination was found to be TSNR followed by Gaussian bandpass filtering then clustering via AHC with a diarisation error rate of 11.9%. With this work, another aspect of the challenge of covertly obtaining and interpreting vibroacoustic intelligence in remote and hostile environments using LDVs has been addressed.","[Richmond, J.

The estimate of the amplitude of the vibration is obtained starting from two or more sequences of images taken by the cameras, by means of triangulation. In this paper, we assume that the system is calibrated, and we focus on the error resulting from pixellisation. The simplified optical model is used to simulate how the accuracy of the measurements varies with respect to: the distance of the cameras from the structure; the opening angle between pairs of cameras; the resolution of the cameras and their number. The aim of the work is to evaluate the influence of the cameras arrangement on the measurement quality, and in particular if the use of a number greater than 2 cameras can allow a reduction of the measurement error, allowing a favorable compromise between spatial and temporal resolution of the cameras. As an example, the average error of the reconstruction of the first flexural deflection shape falls from 12% to 4%, when the measurement setup passes from 2 cameras to 12 cameras in the considered setup.","[Rinaldo, R.; Gardonio, P.; Del Sal, R.; Dal Bo, L.; Turco, E.; Fusiello, A.] Univ Udine, DPIA, Via Sci 206, I-33100 Udine, Italy","Rinaldo, R (corresponding author), Univ Udine, DPIA, Via Sci 206, I-33100 Udine, Italy.",roberto.rinaldo@uniud.it,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2041.0,,,,,,,,12010,10.1088/1742-6596/2041/1/012010,,10,"Mechanics; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing; Optics; Physics, Applied",Mechanics; Materials Science; Optics; Physics,BS4XT,WOS:000723958200010,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-07-14

Furthermore, floating wind turbines (FWTs) are sensitive to low-frequency variations, and therefore to wake meandering perturbations. In the current work, we use the Dynamic Wake Meandering (DWM) model as implemented in DIWA and FAST.Farm, to study the low-frequency content of the meandering at a target turbine placed 8 diameters downstream. At frequencies in the range of the natural frequencies of rigid body motions of semisubmersible floaters, the two models yield different results.

The following vault geometries are investigated and compared against a flat-roof building with the same specifications: (i) segmental, (ii) low-rise pointed, (iii) mid-rise catenary (iv) high-rise pointed and (v) high-rise catenary. The results show that compared to the flat-roof building, the vaulted roofs cause a <5% decrease in volume flow rate and 16-29% increase in the average mean velocity magnitude at the occupants' level. In vaulted buildings, the low-velocity regions of the flow are moved further away from the occupied zone towards the ceiling, thus providing a fresher air to the occupants.

This effect is evident up to a two block distance upstream of the high-rises. Furthermore, it is shown that consequent rows of high-rises in the downstream of the first row facing the wind flow have little effect on the upstream pedestrian wind; however, they have a significant role in the extent of affected areas downstream.

The mean power density at the duct throat (where the turbine can be installed) is investigated in four wind directions of theta = 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees. High-fidelity steady RANS simulations, validated with experimental data, are used.

The variation of wind energy potential in different wind directions is shown to be due to the increased size of the nozzle stagnation and separation regions for. > 0 degrees which limit the nozzle effective area and lower flowrate through the throat.

In this paper, a shallow feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) surrogate model is developed. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is used to train a model with 3 layers and 10 hidden nodes. The model correlates the arrangement of a double-rotor vertical axis wind turbine array, as the fundamental generating cell of the wind farm, with its overall power performance. The inputs are the relative distance (R) and angle (Phi) between the rotors, and the output is the overall power coefficient of the array. In total, 96 CFD-simulated arrangements are used as data points to train, validate and test the model. The trained model has a mean square error of 2.10 x 10(-5) and R-squared of 0.99, indicating its accuracy and generalizability. The average and maximum errors are 3% and 10%, respectively.

Third, it simultaneously outputs optimal thermal mass and insulation of all the required elements in the building. Fourth, it automatically accounts for the user's needs and local regulations.

From the intensive operational period, a case study has been selected for a Wakebench benchmark consisting of four consecutive days with relatively persistent winds from the North. The validation is centered around a 118-m mast at the Alaiz site and six additional masts located along the valley and at the lee side of a ridge delimiting a 8-km long area of interest. The benchmark is a follow-up of the GABLS3 diurnal cycle benchmark in flat terrain to test mesoscale-to-microscale transient and steady-state modeling methodologies in the assessment of stability-dependent bin-averaged wind conditions. Meso-micro methodologies reduce the wind speed mean bias from 32%, at 3-km mesoscale, to +/- 5%. Beyond mean bias mitigation, these initial results demonstrate the added value of meso-micro coupling at reproducing non conventional wind conditions at the test site like high-shear low-level jets in stable conditions and negative wind shear in unstable conditions. The benchmark also discusses the challenges of each meso-micro methodology going forward.","[Sanz Rodrigo, J.] Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, Zamudio, Spain; [Sanz Rodrigo, J.] Natl Renewable Energy Ctr, Sarriguren, Spain; [Santos, P.] Fraunhofer IWES, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Santos, P.; Cavar, D.] Tech Univ Denmark, Roskilde, Denmark; [Chavez Arroyo, R.] UL Serv, Barcelona, Spain; [Avila, M.; Lehmkuhl, O.; Owen, H.] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Barcelona, Spain; [Li, R.; Tromeur, E.] Meteodyn, St Herblain, France","Rodrigo, JS (corresponding author), Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, Zamudio, Spain.;Rodrigo, JS (corresponding author), Natl Renewable Energy Ctr, Sarriguren, Spain.",javier.sanz@siemensgamesa.com,"; Avila, Matias/I-9864-2014","Cavar, Dalibor/0000-0003-1446-2866; Avila, Matias/0000-0003-2248-7676","MARINE2 (EU) [731084]; UPWARDS (EU) [763990]; EoCoE-II (EU) [824158, 828947]; Mexican Department of Energy, CONACYT-SENER Hidrocarburos grant [B-S-69926]","This work was carried out under the umbrella of the International Energy Agency IEA-Wind TCP Task 31 Wakebench, with the support from: MARINE2 (EU grant agreement number 731084) UPWARDS (EU grant agreement number 763990), EoCoE-II (EU grant agreements number 824158 and 828947) and the Mexican Department of Energy, CONACYT-SENER Hidrocarburos grant agreement number B-S-69926.",,26,0,0,1,2,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1934.0,,,,,,,,12002,10.1088/1742-6596/1934/1/012002,,12,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Mechanical; Mechanics; Physics, Fluids & Plasmas",Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Mechanics; Physics,BS3JN,WOS:000712011500002,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2022-07-14

One of them is through the formation of the Task Force for the Acceleration of Handling Covid19 (covid19.go.id ) as a single contact crisis center. However, the extent of the impact that arises will result in preventive, curative and promotive efforts at risk of not being handled properly. The implementation of knowledge management based on graphs (knowledge graph) will enable agile integration between various sources of information. The Graph Data Model captures the relationships of various different entities by connecting them through the edge of information extracted from various heterogeneous sources. After the data is represented in a graphical format, there are various analytic graph techniques for asking multi-hop (multi-node) relationships between entities in the knowledge graph that is built.

However, the usable roof area is often small compared to the building's heat demand, especially in urban areas. It was investigated how much regeneration is possible in districts that are supplied entirely by heat pumps with BHEs. Example buildings were modelled based on the buildings of two districts in Zurich. Uncovered PVT collectors and glazed flat-plate collectors were used as regeneration sources. The possible regeneration was determined in a simulation process that included the effects of mutual influences between the BHEs of neighbouring buildings. As expected, glazed flat-plate collectors allow for more regeneration than uncovered PVT collectors. For full regeneration, the required usable roof area relative to the annual heat demand is about 1.8m(2)/MWh for PVT and 1.2m(2)/MWh for flat-plate collectors. Large buildings often do not provide sufficient roof area for full regeneration. A sustainable heat supply of the entire district with regenerated BHEs can be possible in suburban neighbourhoods, if the bigger buildings are distributed rather evenly. In urban neighbourhoods, areas may exist in which solar thermal regeneration alone is not sufficient.","[Sauter, David; Hunziker, Manuel; Rohrer, Juerg] ZHAW Sch Life Sci & Facil Management, Inst Nat Resource Sci, Gruentalstr 14, Wadenswil, Switzerland; [Poppei, Joachim; Cochand, Fabien] CSD Ingenieure AG, Schachenallee 29A, Aarau, Switzerland; [Hubbuch, Markus] ZHAW Sch Life Sci & Facil Management, Inst Facil Management, Gruentalstr 14, Wadenswil, Switzerland; [Sauter, David] H2 Energy AG, Hohlstr 186, Zurich, Switzerland","Hunziker, M (corresponding author), ZHAW Sch Life Sci & Facil Management, Inst Nat Resource Sci, Gruentalstr 14, Wadenswil, Switzerland.",manuel.hunziker@zhaw.ch; juerg.rohrer@zhaw.ch,,,Swiss Federal Office of Energy,The authors would like to thank the Swiss Federal Office of Energy for the financial support.,,10,0,0,2,2,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12094,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012094,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100094,,gold,,,2022-07-14

Although a complex flow phenomenon behind BIPVs is simplified in the 3D heat transfer model, relatively reliable results are obtained using the chosen simulation tool. It is observed that the east-faced BIPV facade in the test building has higher electrical efficiency. This could be attributed to the lower inertia of the east wall that allows easier propagation of heat through the structure.","[Schindelholz, Romain; Rahiminejad, Mohammad; Chatterjee, Arnab; Khovalyg, Dolaana] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Thermal Engn Built Environm Lab TEBEL, Lausanne, Switzerland","Rahiminejad, M (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Thermal Engn Built Environm Lab TEBEL, Lausanne, Switzerland.",mohammad.rahiminejad@epfl.ch,,,,,,8,0,0,3,3,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12081,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012081,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100081,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-07-14

The piezoelectric (PE) transducer is based on a vibrational energy harvester excited through magnetic plugging, which is induced by the movement of the permanent magnet of the EM harvester. As the magnetic plugging mechanism acts as a frequency-up conversion the device can be used in a wide range of rotational frequencies.

We evaluate these effects based on yaw-corrected power and thrust curves and tabulated turbine load simulation results. In a first step, wind direction and wind speed dependent yaw angles were determined by maximization of the wind farm power for an example wind farm. Secondly, the optimizations were repeated for the objective of minimal flapwise blade fatigue loads. The results were then combined such that the power optimized yaw angles dominate the partial load region while the load optimized results were chosen for higher wind speeds. We find that this combination increases the annual energy production in an example wind rose while simultaneously reducing the lifetime damage equivalent loads. The analysis was repeated including wind direction uncertainty into the optimization. This significantly reduced the benefit of wake steering on AEP but caused only a mild decrease of the overall load reduction.","[Schmidt, Jonas; Requate, Niklas; Vollmer, Lukas] Fraunhofer Inst Wind Energy Syst, Am Seedeich 45, D-27572 Bremerhaven, Germany","Schmidt, J (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Inst Wind Energy Syst, Am Seedeich 45, D-27572 Bremerhaven, Germany.",jonas.schmidt@iwes.fraunhofer.de; niklas.requate@iwes.fraunhofer.de; lukas.vollmer@iwes.fraunhofer.de,,,BMWi [FKZ 0324005],"The simulations were partly performed at the HPC Cluster EDDY, located at the University of Oldenburg (Germany) and funded by BMWi (FKZ 0324005).",,24,0,0,0,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1934.0,,,,,,,,12020,10.1088/1742-6596/1934/1/012020,,10,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Mechanical; Mechanics; Physics, Fluids & Plasmas",Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Mechanics; Physics,BS3JN,WOS:000712011500020,,gold,,,2022-07-14

In practice, rule-based control and PID controllers are typically used and implemented at the beginning of the building operation. Since this approach neither guarantees optimal or even good control, optimal control algorithms (which can be predictive and adaptive) are in the focus of research. The problem with most of the approaches is that a model of the system is often needed which comes with high engineering efforts. Further, the required computing power can quickly exceed the capacities, even in modern buildings. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the application of a state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, as a self-calibrating valve controller for two water-air heat exchangers of a real-world air handling unit. We choose a generic problem formulation to pre-train the algorithm with a simulation of an admixing heater and use it to control an injection heater and a throttle cooler. Our results show that after only 70 hours, the control quality significantly increases. Therefore, it seems evident that with pre-trained RL algorithms, a self-improving HVAC automation can be realized with little hardware requirements and without extensive modelling of the system dynamics.","[Schreiber, T.; Schwartz, A.; Mueller, D.] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Mathieustr 10, D-52072 Aachen, Germany","Schreiber, T (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Mathieustr 10, D-52072 Aachen, Germany.",thomas.schreiber@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,,,BMWi (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy) [03SBE0006A],"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the BMWi (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy), promotional reference 03SBE0006A.",,19,1,1,1,2,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12028,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012028,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100028,,gold,,,2022-07-14

The two co-rotating vortices are generated in a water channel by a one-bladed rotor, whose tip geometry is modified by the addition of a perpendicular fin on the pressure side. The fin parameters are tuned so that the two vortices have approximately equal circulation. Dye visualisations and flow field measurements from Particle Image Velocimetry show that the vortices merge into a single tip vortex within less than one rotor rotation. This fast merging is caused by a rapid increase of the core radii of the initial vortices, which indicates the presence of an instability phenomenon. Analysis of the vortex velocity profiles identifies it as a centrifugal instability, linked to the presence of opposite-signed vorticity in the blade tip region. We further explore the origin of this vorticity by modifying the streamwise fin position. Measurements suggest that the interaction between the secondary fin vortex and the blade surface is partly responsible for the generation of the unstable velocity profile. The vortex resulting from the merging has a significantly larger core size than the one developing without a fin, indicating that this configuration could be beneficial in the context of Blade-Vortex Interaction noise for helicopters, or for the reduction of fatigue loads on wind turbine rotors caused by the interaction with concentrated tip vortices in the wake of upstream turbines.","[Schroeder, D.; Hoernschemeyer, R.; Stumpf, E.] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Aerosp Syst, D-52062 Aachen, Germany; [Leweke, T.] Aix Marseille Univ, Cent Marseille, CNRS, IRPHE, F-13384 Marseille, France","Schroder, D (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Aerosp Syst, D-52062 Aachen, Germany.",schroeder@ilr.rwth-aachen.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [391677260]; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-17-CE06-0018],"This work is part of the German-French project TWIN-HELIX, supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (grant no. 391677260) and the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (grant no.

Looking at the rotor blades, two-bladed turbines with a comparable design either rotate 22.5% faster or have up to 50% increased chord lengths. The latter result in a significantly higher second moment of area, which enables rotor mass savings and thus fewer costs while withstanding similar to 50% higher flapwise loads per blade. Unfortunately, such a design could also cause buckling issues. increasing the design tip speed reduces stability issues but lowers the rotor mass savings. Consequently, the challenging task is to find an optimal compromise between preventing buckling and saving rotor mass, and thus to ensure a fair comparison of two- and three-bladed turbines' blades. To overcome this challenge, a procedure for redesigning a comparable blade structure is introduced. The procedure is exemplarily demonstrated for large 20 MW offshore wind turbines. Compared to the three-bladed reference, the overall rotor mass reduction of the two-bladed turbine is 13.5% for the most beneficial compromise detected. Simultaneously, the blades showing good accordance with the reference concerning static stresses and buckling characteristics under their respective loads.","[Schuett, Marcel; Anstock, Fabian; Schorbach, Vera] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Berliner Tor 21, D-20099 Hamburg, Germany","Schutt, M (corresponding author), Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Berliner Tor 21, D-20099 Hamburg, Germany.",marcel.schuett@haw-hamburg.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy [13FH1I04IA],"The present work is part of the four-year research project \X-Rotor {two-bladed wind turbinesfunded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (reference 13FH1I04IA), whom we would here like to thank.",,24,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2018.0,,,,,,,,12035,10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/012035,,11,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Mechanical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BS3LW,WOS:000713005900035,,gold,,,2022-07-14

An original method for determining MF magnetization is proposed and applied to the obtained data. Magnetization was determined for three magnetic fluid samples. The results obtained by the developed method are comparable to the magnetization values obtained by the ballistic method. The developed and presented technique of a dynamic experiment with measuring oscillations frequency of the MF column suspended in a strong and inhomogeneous magnetic field system involves the creation of a new absolute method for determining saturation magnetization and can be useful for studying magnetophoresis and aggregation processes of magnetic nanoparticles.

It is shown that, at certain critical values for bubble size, flow velocity, and contamination level, the axial symmetry of the surface flow loses its stability in a threshold manner, and the first instability mode in the form of two vortices appears. Below the threshold, the stationary flow on the bubble surface is impossible. The experimental results indicate that the assumption about the axial symmetry of the motion on the bubble surface containing surfactants, which is used in most theoretical and numerical studies, is invalid. Analysis of the results has revealed the most likely reason for the spiral form of the trajectory in the problem of a small rising bubble in the surrounding fluid. For the surfactant-free surface realized in the experiments with isopropyl alcohol, the rising trajectory was a straight line, and no vortex structures were observed on the bubble surface.

Defects in the jaw bones require a structural material with high strength characteristics. The article deals with the method of increasing the strength of polyamide dental material with nanoscale titanium dioxide. Objective: to improve the strength characteristics of orthopedic structures made of polyamide. The study of the polyamide material was carried out on control and experimental samples, in which a modifying component was introduced by the method of dispersion reinforcement - nanoscale titanium dioxide in an amount of up to 1 wt.%. The three-point bending strength (sigma max, MPa) and Young's modulus (E, MPa) were experimentally studied. These criteria are indicative when assessing the strength of the basic structural materials from which removable dentures are made. These parameters take into account both vertical and horizontal functional loads, similar to the forces that arise when using removable dentures. The results of the study showed an increase in the maximum voltage by 8.4%, and the Jung module by 7.2% in samples with nanoscale titanium dioxide introduced into their composition to 1 wt. %.

Retrofit includes fabric energy efficiency improvements. Energy performance certificates (EPCs) inform the householder of typical savings per measure, but this has previously been found to inaccurately estimate space heating energy demand, leading to errors in 'typical savings' presented to householders. The most sensitive inputs have been found to be temperature set point, followed by fabric efficiency. The BREDEM methodology assumes a temperature of 21 degrees C for nine hours a day, rather than similar to 16 degrees C and similar to 20 degrees C found in research. The methods used to inform this study are local sensitivity analysis of the domestic energy model, based on a typical dwelling example with calibrated inputs. This is done using an open calibrated Python model, based on BREDEM. The impact of heating patterns on space heating energy demand are modelled pre retrofit; according to differing heating set points, following wall and loft fabric upgrade and full fabric upgrade. The BREDEM heating set point assumptions lead to space heating energy demand predicted similar to 50-100 kWh/m(2)/yr higher than real heating set points.

To facilitate the quantitative analysis, we developed a polarization-sensitive label-free imaging system based on the Stokes-Mueller calculus. Polarization images of ductal carcinoma tissue samples were obtained using various input polarization states and Stokes-Mueller images were reconstructed using Matlab software. Further, polarization properties, such as degree of linear and circular polarization and anisotropy, were reconstructed from the Stokes images. The Mueller matrix obtained was decomposed using the Lu-Chipman decomposition method to acquire the individual polarization properties of the sample, such as depolarization, diattenuation and retardance. By using the statistical parameters obtained from the polarization images, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was trained to facilitate the tissue classification associated with its pathological condition.","[Sindhoora, K.

However, there exists a trade-off between levitation and guidance forces acting on the vehicle, especially in the case of high-speed curve negotiation. To overcome this trade-off, we proposed a multi-surface permanent magnet guideway (PMG) design, for the small-scale maglev vehicle, in which polarization of the permanent magnets (PM) changing with track segments. The HTS-PM interaction model was constructed by utilizing H-formulation implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics (R). The hysteretic levitation and guiding force expressions used in the dynamic simulation have been obtained by a polynomial fit to force-displacement curves obtained by the finite element model built in COMSOL Multiphysics (R) environment. Also, the damping effect derived from free-fall dynamic tests is incorporated into the model to construct a more realistic simulation model. The effectiveness of the proposed track design has been validated through comparisons with Halbach-derived PMG. Finally, it can be thought that the proposed PMG design is a good candidate for the high-speed operation of a maglev system when the increased levitation and guiding stiffness values are considered.","[Sivrioglu, Selim] Antalya Bilim Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Antalya, Turkey; [Yildiz, Ali Suat] Sivas Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Sivas, Turkey; [Bedirbeyoglu, Muhammet Islam] Gebze Tech Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Gebze, Turkey","Sivrioglu, S (corresponding author), Antalya Bilim Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Antalya, Turkey.",selim.sivrioglu@antalya.edu.tr; suat@sivas.edu.tr; muhammet0islam@gmail.com,,,Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey [217M320],This research study is supported by The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey under the support program of 1001 with project number 217M320.,,18,0,0,2,3,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1975.0,,,,,,,,12030,10.1088/1742-6596/1975/1/012030,,8,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Engineering; Materials Science; Physics,BS3CK,WOS:000709551600030,,gold,,,2022-07-14

This paper examines how the operational strategy of shared battery energy storage systems (s-BESS) can address these issues for commercial buildings with relatively high power peaks. Due to the uncertainty in long-term costs when subject to a measured peak (MP) grid tariff, the scheduling of the battery is optimised with a receding horizon control algorithm. The optimisation model is used on a Norwegian real-life case study to find the best possible configuration with an already existing battery. Although current Norwegian regulations challenge the possibility for shared metering and billing for a s-BESS configuration, the results show that the total system cost was reduced by 19.2% compared to no battery. The community peak was reduced by 17.8% compared to no battery and 6.22-17.5% compared to individual storage, which indicates that s-BESS is of value for the DSO as well.","[Skoglund, Ida E.

The model complex demands only a few global input parameters, such as turbine rotor diameter, nameplate capacity, area of wind farm, number of turbines, water depth, and mean wind speed Weibull parameters for the site. Using actual wind climate and bathymetric data for the North Sea, the model is in the present work used to map the annual energy production and levelized cost of energy (LCoE) for wind farms located in the North Sea. As a main conclusion, exploiting all locations with water depths down to about 45 m comply with the electrical power demand of Europe, which is about 3500 TWh/year. In this case, the LCoE is found to be about 7 (sic)cents/kWh for wind farms consisting of 15 MW wind turbines and an interspacing between the wind turbines of 8 diameter, corresponding to 2 km.","[Sorensen, J.

The method is applicable to e.g. the extreme value with a return period of 10.000 years for wave height, crest height of waves as well as wave-induced response and loads on offshore wind turbine monopiles. The extreme values are determined by a combination of a joint probabilistic description of the met-ocean environment and of a recently developed database of fully nonlinear wave kinematics computations. For two benchmark monopile structures, representative for the conditions at Dogger Bank and the German Bight in the North Sea, the one-hour max value of crest height, inline force and overturning moment are computed via the Rainey slender-body force model. Convolution with the joint probability of the sea state parameters in the nondimensional space of wave steepness and Ursell parameter leads to the marginal probability distribution for these parameters up to a 10.000 year return period and properly accounts for the uncertainty of the extreme value parameters in also the short-term distributions. It is found that the best extreme value fit is generally obtained with a third-order polynomial fit within the space of steepness and Ursell parameter. Compared to the Forristall crest height distribution, the inclusion of full nonlinearity leads to larger crest heights at low return period levels. However, due to its realistic treatment of the breaking limitation, lower crests are predicted at the 10.000 year level for the two positions considered in the North Sea. With further verification of the wave kinematics in combination with load models and a thorough comparison to present engineering practice, the proposed methodology provides a robust future solution for directly estimating extreme value distributions of loads and response of offshore wind turbine monopiles.","[Sorensen, J.

By applying an 'urban transect' approach, preliminary selected microclimate, behavioural and activity observation data is displayed together with spatial information.

In comparison with the preceding study, the consideration is done on a more realistic basis: taking into account saturation of the MAE magnetization in contrast to the former model where the magnetization was supposed to be linear whatever the field strength. This more thorough investigation has revealed that the striction-induced elongation effect, depending on the material parameters, may occur in two forms. One scenario manifests itself as tapering of the polar zones of the former sphere, where 'beaks' are formed, so that the shape of the object drastically deviates from a spheroidal one. The mechanism the underlies the occurrence of beaks is the surface instability of a magnetizable elastic continuum, and the beak nucleation follows the second-order transition pattern; the resulting overall elongation of the body does not display any hysteresis. Another scenario-it is related to MAEs with higher magnetic properties and softer matrices-implies that the beak formation happens simultaneously with a jump-like overall elongation of the former sphere, and this transformation resembles the first-order transition pattern. Upon assessing the chances to observe the predicted effects on the samples of now existing MAEs, one comes to a conclusion that the second scenario is hardly possible, whereas the first one, i.e., beak formation without hysteretic stretching, is much more realizable.","[Stolbov, O., V; Raikher, Yu L.] Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch, Inst Continuous Media Mech, Perm 614068, Russia","Stolbov, OV (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch, Inst Continuous Media Mech, Perm 614068, Russia.",sov@icmm.ru,,,,,,21,1,1,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1945.0,,,,,,,,12056,10.1088/1742-6596/1945/1/012056,,10,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Mechanics",Materials Science; Mechanics,BS4HU,WOS:000719382600056,,gold,,,2022-07-14

Hence, there is a strong need for tools that enable the automatic knowledge extraction from these huge data sets to support system integrators and favor the development of smart energy services, e.g., predictive maintenance. One crucial step in knowledge extraction is the detection of change points and hidden states in measurements. In this work, we present a tool for automated detection of hidden operation modes based on multivariate time series data deploying motif-aware state assignment (MASA). The tool is evaluated utilizing measurements of a heat pump and compared to two baseline algorithms, namely k-Means and k-Medoids. MASA performs particularly well on noisy data, where it shows only a small deviation in the number of detected change points compared to the ground truth with up to 77% accuracy.

The wave source is the inner core, which performs circular oscillations in the equatorial plane. The case of positive frequencies that corresponds to the advanced core motion is considered. As a result of non-linear effects, a quasi-two-dimensional axisymmetric steady flow with a complex distribution of angular velocity is generated. The extrema in the velocity profile are equivalent to the nested liquid geostrophic cylinders, which appearance is due to the interaction of the inertial waves within a viscous boundary layer. One of the extrema is associated with the critical latitude at the core boundary, where the inertial waves are excited. With an increase in the oscillation frequency, the position of this extremum gradually shifts to the rotation axis. Additional geostrophic circulation occurs close to the points where the inertial wave reflects from the cavity boundary.","[Subbotin, S.] Perm State Humanitarian Pedag Univ, Sibirskaya St 24, Perm 614990, Russia","Subbotin, S (corresponding author), Perm State Humanitarian Pedag Univ, Sibirskaya St 24, Perm 614990, Russia.",subbotin_sv@pspu.ru,"Subbotin, Stanislav V/L-6835-2015","Subbotin, Stanislav V/0000-0002-5567-5035",Russian Science Foundation [18-71-10053],The work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (grant No. 18-71-10053).,,20,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1945.0,,,,,,,,12058,10.1088/1742-6596/1945/1/012058,,7,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Mechanics",Materials Science; Mechanics,BS4HU,WOS:000719382600058,,gold,,,2022-07-14

We examined the interference field formed by the radiation of counterpropagating emitters of signals with linear frequency modulation. It is proposed to use two counter-directed emitter arrays focused at the center. The focusing of the emitter arrays is achieved due to the fact that the elements of the arrays are placed on the surface of the sphere in a certain sector. Then the focus point is the center of the sphere at any radiation frequency. When a common- mode wideband signal is applied to all elements of the array, focusing of the wideband signal is achieved in the center of the sphere. When a monochromatic signal is applied, a levitation region elongated along the axis of the system is formed. We consider the case when the distance between the radiating gratings is several times larger than the size of the aperture of the gratings. For wideband signals particles are grouped into a single stable pressure node of standing waves in the center of the system. This provides a single local minimum potential for the selective control of an individual particle. Moreover, a force arises that draws particles into the central region.","[Sukhanov, D.; Rosliakov, S.] Tomsk State Univ, Radiophys Fac, Tomsk, Russia","Sukhanov, D (corresponding author), Tomsk State Univ, Radiophys Fac, Tomsk, Russia.",sdy@mail.tsu.ru,"Sukhanov, Dmitry Y/D-6039-2014; Roslyakov, Sergey N./J-4424-2018","Sukhanov, Dmitry Y/0000-0002-0805-4543; Rosliakov, Sergei/0000-0001-5223-0738",Russian Science Foundation [17-79-20051],The research was supported by a grant from the Russian Science Foundation No 17-79-20051.,,11,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1761.0,,,,,,,,12009,10.1088/1742-6596/1761/1/012009,,7,"Acoustics; Physics, Applied",Acoustics; Physics,BR9PQ,WOS:000679396100009,,gold,,,2022-07-14

In this study, the maximum energy of the electron is 1 eV and the matrix propagation method is used where the effect of the combinations structure on transmission coefficient values is numerically analysed using a computational program. The results showed that the structuring potential barrier affects the value of the transmission coefficient. In the uniform barriers arrangements, the value of the transmission coefficient decreases with increasing potential barrier energy. Whereas in the arrangement of different barrier combinations, two opposing combination arrangements have the same transmission coefficient values. Thus, from six combination arrangements, there are three kinds of transmission coefficient values. The maximum transmission coefficient value is 1.000 in the triple potential barrier of GaSb at 0.49 eV.

The data collection technique was in the form of a written test. The research variable is the science literacy ability of high school students in the content aspect. Samples were taken using purposive sampling. Overall, the average percentage of the results of high school students' scientific literacy skills in East Java based on the aspect of science content is in the low category. The level of students' understanding of basic science concepts is still low or weak, so that students are less able to apply and interpret data, even though the form of the problem is simple. The cause of the low ability of students is in expressing the content of the discourse given and interpreting the data in the form of pictures, tables, diagrams and other forms of presentation. In addition, there are limitations to the students' ability to express thoughts in written form, reasoning skills, reading accuracy is still low, and students are not used to connecting information in the form of text and then expressing it in the form of new expressions to answer given test questions.","[Suroso, J.] Inst Agama Islam Negeri Jember, Jember, Indonesia; [Indrawati; Sutarto; Mudakir, I] Univ Jember, Fac Teacher Training & Educ, Sci Educ, Jember, Indonesia","Suroso, J (corresponding author), Inst Agama Islam Negeri Jember, Jember, Indonesia.",jokosuroso1965@iain-jember.ac.id,", Sutarto/CAF-7781-2022",", Sutarto/0000-0003-2674-5687; Mudakir, Imam/0000-0002-8883-539X; Suroso, Joko/0000-0002-0134-2243",,,,44,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1832.0,,,,,,,,12040,10.1088/1742-6596/1832/1/012040,,13,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Physics, Multidisciplinary",Mathematics; Physics,BS0UA,WOS:000684374700040,,gold,,,2022-07-14

We investigated the crossed-field demagnetization of a EuBa2Cu3O7 coated conductor with BaHfO3 nonorods which has large critical current density. When an AC transverse field is applied after the magnetization of the coated conductor, the decay of trapped field was significantly accelerated. However, for the AC field smaller than the full penetration field parallel to the ab-plane, the decay becomes slow enough.

The case study considered here involves building-induced flows and turbulence with inlet turbulence value as a parameter. The framework proposed employs a Grassmann manifold interpolation approach (GI) for obtaining basis functions corresponding to new values of parameter, and exploits the time series prediction capability of long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network for obtaining temporal coefficients associated with the new basis functions. The methodology works in the following way: (i) in the training phase, the LSTM model is trained on the modal coefficients extracted from the high-resolution data using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) transform for the known values of parameter, and (ii) in the testing phase, the trained model predicts the modal coefficients for the total time recursively based on the initial time history for the new value of parameter. Then, we reconstruct the flow fields for the new value of parameter (new inlet turbulent value) using the GI modulated basis functions and LSTM predicted associated temporal coefficients. To assess the performance of the proposed model, the ROM-LG predictions are compared with the high-dimensional full-order model solutions using L1 and L2 error analyses as well as with the conventional POD based ROM (ROM-POD) solutions. The results indicate that the non-intrusive ROM (ROM-LG) framework yields a stable solution for the velocity fields and for short-term prediction of dynamic turbulent kinetic energy fields.

The titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V is modelled with the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into the elastic and the plastic parts. Isotropic hyperelastic relations between stresses and elastic strains are assumed. The weak invariance of the material model allows for incorporation of residual stresses without additional numerical costs.

In this paper, we comparatively studied three electromagnetic designs in which (1) a permanent magnet was used for the field pole, (2) the HTS bulk was employed as the field pole and (3) the field pole HTS bulk was arranged at an angle in the x-y plane, reducing torque ripple due to torque consistency and tilting of the HTS bulk plate.

Related databases are sought for studies that qualify for examining the effects of using mathematical software compared to traditional teaching on students' mathematical abilities. Random-effect models with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. 40 effect sizes were analyzed from 40 primary studies that have been published in journals, or national and international proceedings from 2010 to 2020, and a total of 3072 students were included in this meta-analysis. The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) program is used to assist analysis. As a result of the study, the overall effect size was 0.886 with a standard error of 0.092. The results of the follow-up analysis showed that the duration of the treatment was related to the use of mathematical software. It was found that the use of mathematical software given in the span of 0 - 4 weeks (effect size = 1.193) was more effective if carried out in more than 4 weeks (effect size = 0.535). Thus the Hawthorne effect influences the effectiveness of the use of mathematical software on students' mathematical abilities.

Direct-drive, permanent magnet generators are favoured due to their increased efficiency, but the added weight is an issue, as this drives up the cost of the nacelle and turbine support structure, along with increasing the manufacturing and installation costs. Therefore, minimizing the mass, particularly the structural mass, of these low speed generators is becoming much more important. A vast amount of research has been done on trying to reduce the electromagnetically 'active' materials, but it is the supporting structure or 'inactive' materials, that makes up the biggest percentage of the generator's mass. Therefore, this paper studies the statics and dynamics of a large offshore direct-drive generator's supporting structure and the opportunities for light-weighting, as well as improvements to the generator's rotor structure through structural optimisation.

In the present work, we investigated EIA on the D-1 Rb-87 line by applying a counter-propagating dual-beam scheme. The main advantage of this scheme is the high resonance contrast - an important parameter for many applications. In our previous work performed in a paraffin-coated cell we observed that, unlike the resonance in buffer gas cell detected in the same experimental scheme, the EIA signal has a complex form, because it is formed by two atomic sub-ensembles in the vapor cell with different relaxation rates determined by the laser excitation conditions. We focused on the narrow component, since it has a higher amplitude-width ratio, making it preferable for applications. We investigate the influence of the atomic vapor density and the pump laser intensity on the resonance parameters in order to optimize the amplitude ratio of the wide and narrow components and achieve the highest amplitude-width ratio value for the narrow component of the EIA resonance.","[Taskova, E.; Alipieva, E.] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Academician Emil Djakov Inst Elect, 72 Tsarigradsko Chaussee, Sofia 1784, Bulgaria","Taskova, E (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Academician Emil Djakov Inst Elect, 72 Tsarigradsko Chaussee, Sofia 1784, Bulgaria.",taskova@ie.bas.bg,,,Bulgarian National Science Fund [DN 08-19/14.12.2016],"The work was supported in part by the Bulgarian National Science Fund, Contract No DN 08-19/14.12.2016 New coherent and cooperative effects in hot alkali atoms.",,9,0,0,1,2,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1859.0,,,,,,,,12025,10.1088/1742-6596/1859/1/012025,,5,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Quantum Science & Technology; Optics; Physics, Applied",Engineering; Physics; Optics,BS2DU,WOS:000700377600025,,gold,,,2022-07-14

All systems showed an acceptable discomfort glare, or daylight glare probability (DGP) lower than 0.35.

Hence, building retrofit is considered as one of the most promising approaches to reduce those shares. However, reducing the energy load should not be an end in itself. The continuous integration of intermittent power sources in the electricity grid imposes new challenges to the supply-demand problem that might directly affect the retrofit process and vice-versa. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a model to analyze the demand flexibility potential of optimal retrofit solutions. Co-simulation and a rolling horizon approach are used to derive upper and lower electricity consumption profiles given some temperature comfort bands. Within those electricity bands, the feasible area provides insights on the extent by which the electricity consumption can be shifted within the comfort constraints. The method is applied to a building archetype. Results show that when the comfort constraints are relaxed the feasible area increases, e.g., up to five times for the case of enhancing the roof insulation, while building retrofit influences the electricity bands. Such a method could enhance the retrofit process and address both the emissions' and the supply-demand balancing problem.","[Thrampoulidis, Emmanouil; Orehounig, Kristina] Empa Duhendorf, Lab Urban Energy Syst, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Thrampoulidis, Emmanouil; Hug, Gabriela] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, EEH Power Syst Lab, Zurich, Switzerland","Thrampoulidis, E (corresponding author), Empa Duhendorf, Lab Urban Energy Syst, Dubendorf, Switzerland.;Thrampoulidis, E (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, EEH Power Syst Lab, Zurich, Switzerland.",,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12149,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012149,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100149,,"gold, Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2022-07-14

In particular, the vessel size and availability are considered. The study is performed with a life-span simulator, based on historical metocean data, walk-to-walk characterization based on a frequency domain hydrodynamic modelling of multibody systems, wind farm fault simulator (based on a catalogue of more than 1800 faults) and an algorithm to reproduce the O&M intelligence (i.e. sea transportation, workability, among others). The frequency domain model is applied on an hourly basis considering the specific significant wave height, peak period, peak enhancement factor, mean heading, directional spreading, and a wave-by-wave strategy is used to find if personnel transfer and workability criteria are met. The WindFloat Atlantic wind farm, located off the coast of Viana do Castello (Portugal), was chosen together with the TRL+ project semi-submersible platform and the 10MW turbine as a reference case. Different vessel logistics options are compared, including full vessel availability and several options of waiting times. The power availability changes among the different cases of study could be compared with the cost changes, optimizing the LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy) of the wind farm. The presented study is a valuable example of the potential of the proposed O&M simulation model as an optimization tool.","[Trueba, Virginia] Tech Univ Madrid UPM, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Rodriguez-Luis, Alvaro; Fernandez-Ruano, Sergio; Guanche, Raul] Univ Cantabria UC, Environm Hydraul Inst Cantabria IH Cantabria, Santander 39001, Spain","Rodriguez-Luis, A (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria UC, Environm Hydraul Inst Cantabria IH Cantabria, Santander 39001, Spain.",alvaro.rodriguezluis@unican.es,"Rodríguez-Luis, Álvaro/AAE-2709-2021","Rodríguez-Luis, Álvaro/0000-0002-7841-7688","research project: ACOPLE - Analisis del COmportamiento dinamico de PLataformas Eolicas flotantes para la optimizacion del diseno de aguas profundas [ENE2017-89716-R]; Ramon y Cajal Program of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [RYC-201723260]","This work is part of two research projects: i) ACOPLE - Analisis del COmportamiento dinamico de PLataformas Eolicas flotantes para la optimizacion del diseno de aguas profundas (grant agreement no.

The sampling procedure and the calculation of the reduced operators in the offline phase is carried out using the finite volume method (FVM), OpenFOAM's libraries specifically, while the construction of the reduced basis and the solution of the online phase is carried out in Python.

Research findings show that people are accustomed to using symbolic measuring instruments rather than formal measuring instruments. Through the use of assumptions, researchers describe and demonstrate the relevance of symbolic measuring instruments with formal instruments that are internationally recognized. The results showed that the indigenous communities of Cigugur possessed and applied ethnomathematics in their lives for generations, so it can be concluded that ethnomathematics is part of their lives and cultural roots which are included in the language system in the universal cultural elements.","[Umbara, Uba] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Sch Postgrad Studies, Jl Dr Setia Budi 229, Bandung 40154, Indonesia; [Umbara, Uba] STKIP Muhammadiyah Kuningan, Dept Math Educ, Jl Moertasiah Supomo 28B, Kuningan 45511, Indonesia; [Wahyudin; Prabawanto, Sufyani] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Dept Math Educ, Jl Dr Setia Budi 229, Bandung 40154, Indonesia","Umbara, U (corresponding author), Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Sch Postgrad Studies, Jl Dr Setia Budi 229, Bandung 40154, Indonesia.;Umbara, U (corresponding author), STKIP Muhammadiyah Kuningan, Dept Math Educ, Jl Moertasiah Supomo 28B, Kuningan 45511, Indonesia.",uba.bara@upmk.ac.id,"Umbara, Uba/AAB-5821-2021",,Ministry of Education and Culture; Ministry of Research and Technology/National Agency for Research and Innovation as scholarship (BPPDN),"On this occasion, the author would like to express appreciation and gratitude to the Ministry of Education and Culture and the Ministry of Research and Technology/National Agency for Research and Innovation as scholarship (BPPDN) and grants (Penelitian Disertasi Doktor), as well as all parties who have a major impact on the success and completion of this research.

When co-directionality between wind, waves and current exists, there is no external loading that can difficult the floater alignment. On the other hand, when certain metocean conditions take place, such as a crosscurrent, a misaligning force can prevent the floater to face towards the main wind direction. In this study, the PivotBuoy floater is used to evaluate the Single Point Moored platform's ability to align with the main wind direction. The platform dynamics are assessed under irregular wind and wave conditions for current speeds ranging from 0.1 m/s to 1.5 m/s for different wind-current alignments. Two solutions for improving the platform alignment are presented and compared against the baseline case, for the extreme and unusual condition where the platform is operating with a crosscurrent of 90 degrees and 0.4 m/s. Both proposed strategies, an active, based on Individual Pitch Control, and a passive where a static nacelle yaw offset is used, are able to reduce the mean alignment to be within 0.8 degrees compared to the baseline case of 18.7 degrees . The preliminary analysis show promising results for the proposed solutions but need to be further investigated in detail.","[Urban, Albert M.; Volta, Laura; Lio, W.

To address this, this research aims to understand students' structure sense ability by investigating strategies used in solving quadratic equations of the form of a square of difference of two variables. To reach these aims, a qualitative descriptive method was conducted in the form of four quadratic equation tasks done by twelve Senior High School Students from one of senior high schools in Bandung. In this study, each student was required to work on each task using two different strategies if possible. The result from the students' answers informed that the majority used structure sense strategy. However, there were mistakes conducted by fifty percent and more students completing both the procedural and structure sense strategy.

This paper applies a free-wake vortex model to derive the geometric characteristics of the wake of a surging rotor under axial and yawed rotor conditions. The study examines the influence of platform motion on the wake boundaries and centreline up to four rotor diameters downstream. It is shown that floating turbine wakes experience a higher degree of perturbation as compared to those of fixed turbines. This is highly dependent on the sea state and suggests the need to develop new analytical wake models for the wind industry that are able to account the effect of platform motion on wake behaviour.","[Valentin, J.; Sant, T.] Univ Malta, Fac Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Msida, Malta; [Valentin, J.] Ecole Natl Super Mecan & Aerotech ISAE ENSMA, Chasseneuil, France","Sant, T (corresponding author), Univ Malta, Fac Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Msida, Malta.",tonio.sant@um.edu.mt,,,,,,20,0,0,4,4,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2018.0,,,,,,,,12044,10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/012044,,11,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Mechanical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BS3LW,WOS:000713005900044,,gold,,,2022-07-14

The fluids fill a horizontal cylindrical container and are brought into a centrifuged state, when a less dense fluid forms a cylindrical core, and a denser fluid is distributed in the form of a coaxial layer. Under the action of the gravity field, the core is steadily displaced along the radius in such a way that its axis is oriented parallel to the container axis and remains stationary in the laboratory frame of reference. In the frame rotating with the container, the core and the fluid surrounding it oscillate. This leads to the generation of a steady flow in the form of differential rotation of the fluid with respect to the container. To study the structure of the flow, light-scattering tracers of neutral buoyancy are added to the liquid. The flow rate is calculated from their displacement. Measurements show that at the interface, from the side of the external fluid, a Stokes boundary layer is formed, at the boundaries of which a tangential discontinuity of the averaged velocity is formed.","[Vlasova, O.

A mixed-use district of 170,000 m(2) floor area including office, residential, retail, education, etc. is studied under current and future climate conditions in Switzerland and Singapore. Our findings are consistent with previous studies, which indicate that DR generally leads to smaller system capacities due to peak shaving. We further show that in both the Swiss and Singapore context, cost and emissions of the MES can be reduced significantly with DR. Applying DR, the optimal area for BIPV placement increases only marginally for Singapore (similar to 1%), whereas for Switzerland, the area is even reduced by 2-8%, depending on the carbon target.

Due to the long-term operation of buildings, future developments and uncertainties need to be considered, which calls for assessing the robustness of retrofit decisions. Existing studies propose robustness metrics for decisions under deep uncertainty to be coupled with a scenario-based simulation approach. We review these metrics and present a simulation approach that includes current and future operational energy, emissions, and costs. We apply the seven identified metrics to retrofit decisions of a multifamily house located in Zurich, where future scenarios in terms of climate, occupancy, decarbonization, and cost development are included. The metrics are based on different assumptions and positions towards risk. We further find that the discriminatory power is different, confirming the Minimax Regret metric to be most suitable for the building context when looking at individual buildings. For the case study, we find that deep retrofit seems to be a robust decision from an environmental perspective. From a cost perspective, the electrification of the heating system with heat pumps and the installation of PV without a complete envelope retrofit proves to be most robust.","[Walker, Linus; Kuhn, Alexandra; Hischier, Illias; Schlueter, Arno] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Technol Architecture, Chair Architecture & Bldg Syst, Stefano Franscini Pl 1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Walker, L (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Technol Architecture, Chair Architecture & Bldg Syst, Stefano Franscini Pl 1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",walker@arch.ethz.ch,"Schlueter, Arno/CAF-1531-2022","Schlueter, Arno/0000-0003-4999-2218",,,,16,0,0,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12150,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012150,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100150,,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-07-14

The current configuration of the latter requires considerable amounts of resource flows causing the degradation of local and global ecosystems. To face the complexity of these challenges, scientists use the concept of urban metabolism (UM), i.e. measuring urban input and output flows from a systemic perspective. This accounting method results in a large data collection from multiple sources that are often not harmonised. Metabolism of Cities Data Hub is an online platform which facilitates data collection, processing and visualisation in order to extract urban metabolism insights. This work highlights the challenges faced when mining urban metabolism data in the case of Lausanne and Geneva, as well as provides insights on how data could be best used from users and providers. Slight differences between the two case studies, in terms of data accessibility and availability where experienced but the main challenges revolved around data copyright, format and availability. As a conclusion, the used tool can enable harmonisation and standardisation of UM data. As such it could contribute to the use of data mining to streamline the environmental monitoring of cities as well as facilitate the creation of mitigation strategies.","[Wiedmann, N.

Results suggest which low-carbon energy conversion technologies and efficiency measures should be adopted by the district alongside supportive local policies and targets. Photovoltaic (PV) and waste energy converters are two renewable energy technologies which are taken up at maximum possible rates in the evaluated scenarios to reduce long-term CO2 emissions. Once local renewable resources are exhausted, natural gas-based combined-cycle plants (CCP) and combined heat and power plants (CHP) are required to further reduce emissions, alongside efficiency measures in the built environment. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies also demonstrate the potential to drastically reduce emissions; however, local feasibility studies are needed to support their implementation.

In this paper, we perform a featured-based cluster analysis on nine building archetypes (hospitals, schools, offices, hotels, flats, houses etc.) to identify electricity use patterns. Then, four metrics are developed, which are entropy, load curviness, peak intensity and index of hourly ramp rates, to measure these archetypes' suitability to be involved in demand response schemes. A significant difference in electricity use patterns between the archetypes is found, as well as among the seasons and days of the week. We present a number of metrics for each archetype to establish which type of archetype should be prioritised for demand response programmes in terms of peak management, ramp rates as well as demand flexibility. A key finding of our study is that households offer more demand flexibility than the non-domestic sector and should therefore be incentivized to participate in dynamic electricity tariffs.","[Yilmaz, Selin] Univ Geneva, Chair Energy Efficiency, Inst Environm Sci, Uni Carl Vogt, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; Univ Geneva, Dept FA Forel Environm & Aquat Sci, Uni Carl Vogt, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland","Yilmaz, S (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Chair Energy Efficiency, Inst Environm Sci, Uni Carl Vogt, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",Selin.Yilmaz@unige.ch,,,,,,8,0,0,3,4,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12021,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012021,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100021,,gold,,,2022-07-14

Nowadays, the carrier-to-noise-density ratio (C/N-0) of the optical signal is limited with a maximum C/N-0 of 168 dB/Hz. However, due to the noise of electronic devices and the digitizer, the final digital signal has a lower carrier-to-noise ratio than the optical signal, therefore, the expected resolution of the demodulation results cannot be obtained. In order for the sampled signal to maintain the C/N-0 of the optical signal, the signal needs to be amplified. However, because of the saturation characteristics of the amplifier, choosing a large amplification will lead to clipping. To investigate the impact of a clipped LDV signals, this paper demonstrates mathematically that, for signals with small phase modulation, clipping does not affect the sidebands of the signal. Therefore, a large amplification can lead to a higher power of the sidebands in the digital signal and thus obtain a higher sideband-to-noise ratio. Meanwhile, the results of mathematical derivation prove that the amplitude of the carrier is lost after clipping. Therefore, the demodulation results of the clipped PM signal are incorrect for small phase modulation. In this paper, the simulation of the error of the demodulation results is given for different vibration amplitudes of the measured objects and different amplification.","[Yu, M.; Schewe, M.; Bauer, G.; Rembe, C.] Tech Univ Clausthal, Dept Appl Metrol, Inst Elect Informat Technol, Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany","Yu, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Clausthal, Dept Appl Metrol, Inst Elect Informat Technol, Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany.",yu@iei.tu-clausthal.de,,"Schewe, Marvin/0000-0002-5014-5182","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [431078650, RE3980/5-1]","This research was funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (grant number: 431078650, RE3980/5-1).",,10,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2041.0,,,,,,,,12006,10.1088/1742-6596/2041/1/012006,,12,"Mechanics; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing; Optics; Physics, Applied",Mechanics; Materials Science; Optics; Physics,BS4XT,WOS:000723958200006,,gold,,,2022-07-14

In order to make CSLDV also suitable for testing structures with arbitrary rectangular holes, a novel method of area-partitioned continuous scanning test and mode reconstruction is further proposed in this paper. In the first step, the surface of a flat plate structure with arbitrary rectangular holes is divided into several rectangular sub regions by an appropriate area-partitioned method, and the operational deflection shape(ODS) of each sub region is obtained by a continuous scanning at constant speed. Then, considering that the ODSs of all sub regions are spliced and the relative phases among them are different, the operational deflection shape of the whole structure is reconstructed based on linear function and other process. Finally, a plate structure with two arbitrary rectangular holes was taken as an example for modal test using the proposed method. At the same time, a validated experiment was performed using the SLDV measurement. The results show the mode shapes derived from the extended CSLDV are in agreement with those from SLDV and the Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) between the two are all greater than 0.95. This method has great potential in practical engineering applications with the advantages of high efficiency and the full-field measurement.","[Zhang, Lei; Zang, Chaoping] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China","Zhang, L (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China.",zlzhanglei@nuaa.edu.cn; c.zang@nuaa.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [12072146]; Sichuan Gas Turbine Research Institute of AVIC,The authors gratefully appreciate the financial support for this work provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.12072146).

However, the existing studies have not constructed a systematic and complete evaluation index system (EIS) or diversified the index weighting method. To solve the problem, this paper tries to evaluate and predict college students' SHL based on artificial neural network (ANN). Firstly, an EIS was designed for college students' SHL, including 4 goals, and 19 primary indices, and the structure of the evaluation and prediction system was presented for college students' SHL. Next, college students' SHL was comprehensively evaluated through analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Finally, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) was established to predict college students' SHL, and the initial weights were optimized by genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed EIS and prediction model were found scientific and effective through experiments. To sum up, the SHL of college students were evaluated and predicted in the following aspects: EIS construction, evaluation model establishment, and evaluation system design. The proposed model and system can comprehensively rate college students' SHL. The statistical analysis of the ratings reflects the gaps between indices, and identifies those doing well and poorly on each index. Then, pertinent intervention can be implemented to satisfy the actual needs of improving college students' SHL.","[Zhang, Qinghua] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Phys Educ, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Zhang, QH (corresponding author), China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Phys Educ, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zqhcumt@163.com,,,Double Top-Class universities Construction Program of China University of Mining and Technology [2018WHCC10]; Project Name: Strategy for Increasing Investment in Physical Education Learning of Colleges in Jiangsu Province [T-b/2020/09],"The research projects of the Double Top-Class universities Construction Program of China University of Mining and Technology (2018WHCC10).

The standard treatment for ACL rupture patients is Reconstruction Anterior Cruciate Ligament (RACL) surgery, followed by rehabilitation lasting six to nine months. Consistent post-RACL medical rehabilitation can restore normal knee function. In this study, proposes a real-time simulation of knee joint angle estimation from electromyogram (EMG) signals for medical rehabilitation of RACL patients. Which is the continuation of this program is to be able to create an exoskeleton to increase the consistency and quality of medical rehabilitation of RACL patients. The method used to make this simulation is using LabVIEW software to simultaneous data collection between the EMG signal from the bicep femoralis muscle and the knee angle. The simultaneous data is processed using a Monte Carlo calculation to estimate the knee angle from the EMG signals The LabVIEW simulation shows that the knee angle's estimate was close enough to the measured knee angle and had a small time delay. It can be concluded that simulation of knee angle estimation from the EMG signal produces a good simulation and can be developed to the exoskeleton.","[Zuchruf, Y.

In the model measuring cell, the physical causes and relationships in the conductivity of the air flow, saturated with an electrolytic fluid aerosol created by an ultrasonic nebulizer have been investigated experimentally. The design of a new electrical impedance spirometer in the form of a mouthpiece with electrical sensors, filled with a porous medium impregnated with electrolyte, through which the patient breathes, is developed and tested. To register fluctuations in the magnitude of the impedance modulus, an original hardware and software complex is used, made on the basis of a high-speed analog-to-digital converter. Based on electrical impedance analysis data, the methods are proposed for quantitative assessment of the basic spirometric medical indicators characterizing the state and functioning of the patient's breathing apparatus, such as respiration rate, entry and expiration rate, exhaled air volume, amount and concentration of exhaled lung fluid.","[Zuev, A.

However, most laboratory diagnostics methods (such as biochemical, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, etc.) are too expensive and time-consuming. They demand the availability of well-equipped laboratories, complex equipment, scarce and expensive reactants and materials and the highly skilled medical staff.Compared to them, bioimpedansometry is an incomparably simpler and cheaper method of laboratory research, becoming increasingly popular for diagnosing internal diseases. In the current research the main physical factors responsible for bioelectrical impedance variations in some conductive intracellular and extracellular biological fluids with different protein molecules, cell components and microbes were studied experimentally. The original laboratory impedance meter was developed for investigation of blood or interstitial biological fluids as well as condensates composition in orderto determine the concentration of organic substances in them and the rate of biochemical and immune reactions.","[Zuev, A.

Experiments were carried out using the original hydrodynamic apparatus modelling different hemodynamic conditions, i.e., a pulsatile flow in a blood vessel of variable diameter, ramified pulmonary blood flows and the function of a cardiac valve. Computer-assisted signal processing techniques provided measurements of the active and capacitive components of the electrical conductivity with an error not exceeding 0.1%. Impedance values were analyzed for different vessel size and geometry, flow rate, temperature, concentration of ionic and dielectric components in some model biological fluids at different frequencies of the probing alternating current. It has been found that bioimpedance oscillations can be mainly attributed to the local modulations of the diameter of blood vessels such as the function of cardiac valves.","[Zuev, A.
