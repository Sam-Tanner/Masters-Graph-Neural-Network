In college English classroom teaching mode, as a brand teaching form, College English multimedia network teaching environment has brought advantages to classroom teaching, but also brought about impacts on teaching concepts, teaching models, teaching methods and other aspects. There are some phenomena that are inconsistent with the reform model at the students, teachers and the environment. The balance of traditional English classroom teaching has been broken, which has affected the smooth progress of college business English classroom teaching mode reform. It is very important to analyze and resolve these imbalances and find ecological methods for optimizing university English education. In this context, the advent of multimedia-assisted education technology has provided better conditions for the implementation of Business English classroom education in universities. Multimedia-powered business English education allows teachers to create a better language learning environment in class more conveniently and quickly, helping students acquire grammar knowledge and achieve their educational objectives.","[Liang, Yan] LanZhou JiaoTong Univ, Sch Art & Design, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China","Liang, Y (corresponding author), LanZhou JiaoTong Univ, Sch Art & Design, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.",liangyan@lzjtu.edu.cn,,,,,"Ampa A.

In recent years the carrier and reference modification based research is going on the inverter field. This paper suggests that the alteration of carriers and references of the three phase voltage source inverter enhance the ability to decrease the harmonic content.This enhanced realization deals with the carrier and reference modification arrangement for three phase voltage source inverter through amalgamating the boosted reference and random triangular carrier. The boosted reference is the addition of sine reference with injection of 1/3rd of reference amplitude (3fs) in the middle portion of the reference wave. i.e., Pi/3 to 2 Pi/3 and 4 Pi/3 to 5 Pi/3. The proposed PWM scheme use two carriers, one is Triangle wave and another one is inverted Triangle wave. The process of selecting the winning carrier among the two triangle carriers is purely based on the LFSR technique. The spectral quality of the induction motor drives has improved by the random carriers. The simulation and experimental values are proving the validity of the PWM method. The PWMs are generated by using parallel processing enabled FPGA processor.","[Anand, R.] Nehru Inst Engn & Technol, Dept EEE, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Padmasuresh, L.] Baselios Mathews II Coll Engn, Dept EEE, Sasthamkotta, Kerala, India; [Muthukumar, P.; Ramesh, M., V] Prasad V Potluri Siddhartha Inst Technol, Dept EEE, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Sreeja, P.] KMEA Engn Coll, Dept EEE, Aluva, Kerala, India; [Krishnakumar, V] St Josephs Coll Engn, Dept EEE, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","Muthukumar, P (corresponding author), Prasad V Potluri Siddhartha Inst Technol, Dept EEE, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India.",muthukumarvlsi@gmail.com,"Paramasivan, Muthu kumar/D-8874-2018; vengadakrishnan, krishnakumar/AAH-8465-2020","Paramasivan, Muthu kumar/0000-0002-4430-2145; vengadakrishnan, krishnakumar/0000-0001-6319-5237; L, PADMA SURESH/0000-0001-8939-1113",,,"Aleem SHEA, 2019, IEEE ACCESS, V7, P100824, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.293083; Arulmozhiyal R, 2010, J POWER ELECTRON, V10, P65, DOI 10.6113/JPE.2010.10.1.06; Guzman-Ramirez E, 2015, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V52, P22, DOI 10.1177/002072091557123; Harrison CG, 1997, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V34, P370, DOI 10.1177/00207209970340040; Jacob T., 2016, INT C EM TECHN TREND, P1, DOI [10.1109/ICETT.2016.7873768, DOI 10.1109/ICETT.2016.7873768; Jeyashanthi J, 2020, CONTROL ENG APPL INF, V22, P6; Kim KS, 2009, IEEE T POWER ELECTR, V24, P192, DOI 10.1109/TPEL.2008.200661; Krishnakumar V, 2015, AUST J BASIC APPL SC, V9, P16; Lim YC, 2010, IEEE T POWER ELECTR, V25, P797, DOI 10.1109/TPEL.2009.203569; Marikkannan A, 2019, CONTROL ENG APPL INF, V21, P5; Muthukumar P, 2020, J POWER ELECTRON, V20, P479, DOI 10.1007/s43236-020-00034-; Sathik MAJ, 2017, ELECTR POW COMPO SYS, V45, P1001, DOI 10.1080/15325008.2017.131943; Shankar M, 2019, CONTROL ENG APPL INF, V21, P3",13,0,0,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The device is improved from the traditional thyristor-controlled series compensation (TCSC), which has the characteristics of small output harmonics and simple control. The traditional saturated iron-core reactor is improved to increase the adjustable range of output reactance. During the fault, the MCR is connected to the grid alone to limit fault current; when the grid is normal, MCR and capacitor are used in series compensation mode. It effectively improves the utilization rate of the traditional current limiter MCR. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed MCSC-FCL, this paper analyzes the control characteristics of reactor models with different air gap structures by JMAG finite element analysis software, and verifies the voltage regulation characteristics and fault current limitation capabilities on MATLAB/Simulink platform.","[Yao, Lei; Wang, Ruixin] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China","Yao, L (corresponding author), Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China.",yaolei_usst@126.com,,"Wang, Ruixin/0000-0002-6559-8352",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51707121],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number is 51707121.","Adly AR, 2020, INT J ELEC POWER, V120, DOI 10.1016/j.ijepes.2020.10602; Adly AR, 2020, MEASUREMENT, V151, DOI 10.1016/j.measurement.2019.10715; Alam MS, 2018, ENERGIES, V11, DOI 10.3390/en1105102; Alves LF, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P62, DOI 10.1177/002072091878745; Dimitrovski A, 2015, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V30, P1708, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2015.240013; Linden J, 2019, ENERGIES, V12, DOI 10.3390/en1210182; Nakamura K, 2000, IEEE T MAGN, V36, P3565, DOI 10.1109/20.90889; Nakamura K, 2008, IEEE T MAGN, V44, P4107, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2008.200286; Omar AI, 2019, ISA T, V95, P110, DOI 10.1016/j.isatra.2019.05.00; Shen HC, 2018, ENERGIES, V11, DOI 10.3390/en1112347; [姚磊 Yao Lei], 2013, [电网技术, Power System Technology], V37, P250; Yuan JX, 2020, HIGH VOLT, V5, P416, DOI 10.1049/hve.2019.004; Zhang JY., 2011, INT C APPL SUP EL DE, P1; Zhong Y., 2019, IEEE T MAGN, V55, P",14,0,0,1,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The article is based on the example of classes in microcontrollers programming and electronic circuits. The methods with the use of simulation programs and an innovative approach enabling work on real equipment are presented. The solutions presented in the article were practically and successfully implemented in connection with the coronavirus pandemic in spring 2020 at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of West Pomeranian University of Technology in Szczecin. A very important feature of the presented ideas is the possibility to adapt the already existing stationary solutions to remote work and use free applications. The characteristic feature of the presented ideas is also simplicity. These two features make it possible to implement remote learning quickly and at a low-cost. Classes conducted using the described system for a group of about 50 students were positively evaluated by them.

The multimodal literacy teaching in the college English multimodal teaching mode is to help students internalize their English language skills after learning and understanding English knowledge, thus improving the efficiency of English learning. The hot spots and topics in the information age are always inseparable from technological innovation. Wearable technology is becoming more and more popular, the scope of research is expanding, and innovations are constantly emerging, showing interdisciplinary and integrated features. This paper introduces the wearable technology in detail, and takes the college English teaching as an opportunity. Through the questionnaire survey of teachers and students, this paper analyzes the survey data. The results of the survey show that wearable technology can stimulate academic interest in college English. This research attempts to conduct interdisciplinary research on multi-modal semiotics and humanistic teaching methods in the following areas, which expands the scope of research and, to a certain extent, enhances the vitality of multi-modal discourse analysis.","[Dou, Qiang] Xian Fanyi Univ, Sch Educ, Xian 710105, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Dou, Q (corresponding author), Xian Fanyi Univ, Sch Educ, Xian 710105, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",john811221@126.com,,,,,"Aliverti A, 2017, BREATHE, V13, pE27, DOI 10.1183/20734735.00841; Antropova N, 2017, MED PHYS, V44, P5162, DOI 10.1002/mp.1245; Chartsias A, 2018, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V37, P803, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2017.276432; Chen JF, 2022, IEEE T SOFTWARE ENG, V48, P1529, DOI [10.1109/TSE.2020.3023955, 10.1109/TETC.2020.2974183; Chen YT, 2019, MATHEMATICS-BASEL, V7, DOI 10.3390/math701001; Crooks KR, 2017, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V114, P7635, DOI 10.1073/pnas.170576911; de Florian D, 2017, PHYS REV D, V95, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.95.09401; Ding ST, 2019, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V93, P583, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.10.05; Fenchel Daphna, 2017, Harefuah, V156, P77; Haghi M, 2017, HEALTHC INFORM RES, V23, P4, DOI 10.4258/hir.2017.23.1.; Herrlinger S, 2017, RES SCI EDUC, V47, P685, DOI 10.1007/s11165-016-9525-; Kolodzey L., 2017, BMJ INNOV, V3, P55, DOI DOI 10.1136/BMJINNOV-2016-00013; Li JH, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091989108; Liu L, 2017, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V26, P107, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2016.261926; Lv ZH, 2021, ACM T MULTIM COMPUT, V17, DOI 10.1145/339129; Lv ZH, 2021, ACM T INTERNET TECHN, V21, DOI 10.1145/338276; Lv ZH, 2020, APPL SOFT COMPUT, V92, DOI 10.1016/j.asoc.2020.10630; Lv ZH, 2020, IEEE T IND INFORM, V16, P2566, DOI 10.1109/TII.2019.291668; Meijer HA, 2018, ARCH PHYS MED REHAB, V99, P1890, DOI 10.1016/j.apmr.2017.10.01; Pevnick JM, 2018, TRENDS CARDIOVAS MED, V28, P144, DOI 10.1016/j.tcm.2017.08.00; Praveen S., 2017, INT J COMPUTATION IN, V13, P212; Ramya K, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P364, DOI 10.1177/002072091881380; Ranker J, 2018, SOC SEMIOT, V28, P169, DOI 10.1080/10350330.2017.127891; Ravi D, 2017, IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH, V21, P56, DOI 10.1109/JBHI.2016.263328; Royce TJ, 2019, CLIN GENITOURIN CANC, V17, P23, DOI 10.1016/j.clgc.2018.09.02; Seneviratne S, 2017, IEEE COMMUN SURV TUT, V19, P2573, DOI 10.1109/COMST.2017.273197; Srinivasa KG, 2018, J ORGAN END USER COM, V30, P83, DOI 10.4018/JOEUC.201810010; Stephenson A, 2017, INT J BEHAV NUTR PHY, V14, DOI 10.1186/s12966-017-0561-; Villermaux E, 2017, INT J FRACTURE, V206, P171, DOI 10.1007/s10704-017-0207-; Xu ZW, 2018, AM J HUM GENET, V103, P100, DOI 10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.06.00; Zhang N, 2015, IEEE COMMUN MAG, V53, P59, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2015.712004; Zhang YS, 2020, IEEE T INF FOREN SEC, V15, P1683, DOI 10.1109/TIFS.2019.294787",32,0,0,18,51,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

From the point of view of the characteristics of design as a subject, the discipline of design is comprehensive and application-oriented. It is comprehensive as it involves different types of disciplines such as technical skills, abstract concepts and theoretical knowledge, and different types of knowledge such as knowledge about practical skills, human thinking and information, as well as different types of capabilities such as professional skills, creative thinking, knowledge acquisition and application. The knowledge structure of the design subject consists of three dimensions, the thinking level, knowledge level and technical level. The inherent connections of the different branches of the design discipline are as follows: they are interconnected on the thinking level, related on the knowledge level and different on the skill level. The knowledge and abilities on these three dimensions compose the design skills designers should acquire, among which the thinking level serves as the foundational and core piece. Therefore, the design education reform should focus on cultivating students' abilities, especially students' thinking skills. Then, it can be concluded that design education should not emphasize the difference of design direction, but should pay attention to the training of students' design ability instead of the training of students' skills, especially the training of students' thinking ability.","[Gao Chao] Jingdezhen Ceram Inst, Grad Sch, Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Jin Yinzhen] Jingdezhen Ceram Inst, Sch Arts & Archaeol, Jingdezhen 333000, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","Jin, YZ (corresponding author), Jingdezhen Ceram Inst, Sch Arts & Archaeol, Jingdezhen 333000, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",327016271@qq.com,,,,,"Abdelaziz AY., 2018, CLASSICAL RECENT ASP, DOI DOI 10.1016/B978-0-12-812441-3.00016-; [Anonymous], 2016, JAPAN HUGO SARRAZIN, P7; Brown Bruce, 2016, DESIGN PROBLEMS, VI, P; Ezio M., 2016, EVERYBODY DESIGNS AN, P4; Fung CH, 2020, TECHNOL KNOWL LEARN, V25, P479, DOI 10.1007/s10758-020-09443-; Hang J., 2018, GIST CHINESE DESIGN, P1; Hight C, 2006, ARCHIT DESIGN, P; John D., 2014, TRANSLATED WU ZHONGY, P4; John H., 2013, DESIGN VERY SHORT I; Klaus L., 2016, DESIGN ED ED DESIGN, P3; Klaus L., 2016, DESIGN ED EDUCATIO; Kuzle A, 2017, TECHNOL KNOWL LEARN, V22, P37, DOI 10.1007/s10758-016-9284-; Li K, 2019, OPEN ED RES, V25, P66, DOI DOI 10.13966/J.CNKI.KFJYYJ.2019.04.00; Li L., 2005, INTRO ART DESIGN, P2; Li Y., 2012, THEORY METHOD PRODUC, P1; Li Y., 2019, DESIGN DIMENSIONS, P; Liu G., 2019, DESIGN METHODOLOGY, P3; Liu G., 2019, DESIGN METHODOLOGY, P4; Liu X., 2006, DESIGN THINKING, P1; Moore Brooke Noel, 2018, CRITICAL THINKING, P; Paul A., 2009, P 8 EUR AC DES C AB, P3; Ray K., 2013, CREATE THINKING MYST, P2; Robert F., 2010, OXFORD HDB INTERDIS; Rodgers PA., 2008, PERIMETERS BOUNDARIE, P; Tang X, 2019, IND DESIGN MAG, V1, P3; THISTLEWOOD D, 1988, J ART DESIGN EDUC, V7, P37, DOI 10.1111/j.1476-8070.1988.tb00730.; Valerie B., 2010, TACKLING WICKED PRO; Xie H., 2020, ED MODERNIZATION, V1, P4; Yi Z., 2019, J ART ED, V4, P16; Zhao W., 2018, ED TREND ARTS DESIGN, V4, P14; Zhu S., 2018, J ART DESIGN, V1, P10",31,0,0,12,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

According to research needs, through the research and summary of the content of the literature, the views, thoughts, methods and relevant opinions on the reform of law teaching have been collected. This article uses a questionnaire survey to conduct a sample survey of 300 students and 28 teachers, and grasp their opinions and suggestions on the reform of law teaching. At the same time, comprehensive reforms have been made to the subject setting, teaching strategy, teaching effect and performance evaluation. The results of the study showed that the satisfaction rate of the students before the reform was 77.03%, which was significantly lower than the 95.76% after the reform (P < 0.05). After the reform, the total reasonable rate of teaching strategies was 99.08% (P < 0.05), and the satisfaction of teaching management before the reform was 73.50%, which was lower than the 97.60% after the reform (P < 0.05). The teaching strategy was obvious, and the teaching subjects were complete. And reasonable teaching content plays a vital role in the reform of the law major of our school, and provides a foundation for the reform of law major.","[Jiang, Li] Xian Med Univ, Sch Hlth Serv Management, Xian 710021, Peoples R China","Jiang, L (corresponding author), Xian Med Univ, Sch Hlth Serv Management, Xian 710021, Peoples R China.",ajiangli@xiyi.edu.cn,,,,,"Adams M, 2019, HAGUE J RULE LAW, V11, P1, DOI 10.1007/s40803-019-00090-; Allbright TN, 2019, AM J EDUC, V125, P173, DOI 10.1086/70124; Burgin R, 2019, BRIT J CRIMINOL, V59, P296, DOI 10.1093/bjc/azy04; Caputo T, 2019, POLICE PRACT RES, V20, P98, DOI 10.1080/15614263.2018.155128; Chao X, 2019, J LANG IDENTITY EDUC, V18, P70, DOI 10.1080/15348458.2019.157573; Dehghani K, 2018, LANCET PUBLIC HEALTH, V3, pE133, DOI 10.1016/S2468-2667(18)30002-; Dougan M, 2019, LAW TEACH, V53, P197, DOI 10.1080/03069400.2019.158219; Fowler J, 2018, INT J THER REHABIL, V25, P500, DOI 10.12968/ijtr.2018.25.9.50; Hathaway OA, 2019, INT AFF, V95, P45, DOI 10.1093/ia/iiy24; Lucijanic M, 2019, CL LYMPH MYELOM LEUK, V19, pE399, DOI 10.1016/j.clml.2019.04.00; Molloy E, 2020, ASSESS EVAL HIGH EDU, V45, P527, DOI 10.1080/02602938.2019.166795; Ozerdem OC, 2016, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V53, P331, DOI 10.1177/002072091663032; Panjwani F, 2018, BRIT J RELIG EDUC, V40, P268, DOI 10.1080/01416200.2018.149326; Peters MA, 2019, EDUC PHILOS THEORY, V51, P867, DOI 10.1080/00131857.2018.154610; Phillips E, 2019, MED EDUC, V53, P638, DOI 10.1111/medu.1381; Richmond G, 2019, J TEACH EDUC, V70, P86, DOI 10.1177/002248711882433; Sargent T., 2018, CHINESE EDUC SOC, V51, P24; Song RL, 2019, NATL SCI REV, V6, P1, DOI 10.1093/nsr/nwz00; SueSee B, 2019, CURRIC STUD HEALTH P, V10, P34, DOI 10.1080/25742981.2018.155249; Thakur S, 2019, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V78, P3457, DOI 10.1007/s11042-018-6263-; Trengove E, 2017, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V54, P119, DOI 10.1177/002072091668848; Tsai SB, 2015, P I MECH ENG B-J ENG, V229, P135, DOI 10.1177/095440541455874; Wang F, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V57, P73, DOI 10.1177/002072091881381; Wei XS, 2019, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC, V27, P102, DOI 10.1002/cae.2206; Witschge J, 2019, BRIT EDUC RES J, V45, P298, DOI 10.1002/berj.350",25,0,0,5,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

However, there are still many problems in the training of translators in colleges and universities in terms of teachers, teaching time and teaching mode. In the context of the era of big data, this article uses questionnaires and data analysis, starting from the PACTE translation ability model, combined with constructivist learning theory, blended learning theory, and instructional design theory to analyze the problems of undergraduate translation ability. This article conducts a questionnaire survey on the 2018 students of XX University's a major, and analyzes their English scores. Students' bilingual ability is weak, and it is difficult to consider translation under the influence of context in the translation process; their strategic ability is not ideal, and they lack the ability to solve problems when they encounter specific translation problems. The English performance of the experimental class students who have undergone English translation teaching for one semester is significantly better than the control class students who have not received English translation teaching. Teachers can combine teaching theories to design English translation teaching and cultivate students' awareness of comparative analysis in English learning. Teachers can cultivate students' English thinking ability, promote them to master English better, and help them improve their English application ability.","[Liu, Yue] Jilin Prov Econ Management Cadre Coll, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Bai, Hongyan] Shijiazhuang Tiedao Univ, Sifang Coll, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Bai, Hongyan] Shijiazhuang Tiedao Univ, Foreign Language Dept, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, Peoples R China","Bai, HY (corresponding author), Shijiazhuang Tiedao Univ, Sifang Coll, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei, Peoples R China.",hongyanbai@hotmail.com,,,,,"Adams M, 2017, TECHNOL INNOV MANAG, V7, P1; Alotaibi HM, 2017, ARAB WORLD ENGL J, V8, P319, DOI 10.24093/awej/vol8no3.2; Chen W, 2019, 2019 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTS, MANAGEMENT, EDUCATION AND INNOVATION (ICAMEI 2019), P344, DOI 10.23977/icamei.2019.06; Duan YQ, 2019, INT J INFORM MANAGE, V48, P63, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.01.02; Grisham William, 2017, J Undergrad Neurosci Educ, V16, pA6; Gutterman CL, 2017, BIG-DAMA '17: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 WORKSHOP ON BIG DATA ANALYTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING FOR DATA COMMUNICATION NETWORKS, P37, DOI 10.1145/3098593.309860; Hiley D, 2018, MUSIC LETT, V99, P471, DOI 10.1093/ml/gcy05; Hou H., 2017, J ED SCI HUNAN NORMA, V16, P69, DOI DOI 10.19503/J.CNKI.1671-6124.2017.05.01; Huda M, 2017, INT J EMERG TECHNOL, V12, P68, DOI 10.3991/ijet.v12i03.643; Jia C, 2019, J CHENGDU NORMAL U, V35, P11; Jin YH, 2020, MILITARY MED RES, V7, DOI 10.1186/s40779-020-0233-; Ke X., 2018, J HLONGJIANG VOCAT I, V31, P15; Lei Y., 2019, VOCAT TECHNOL, V18, P5; Li AF, 2015, J COMPUT, V10, P166, DOI 10.17706/jcp.10.3.166-17; Li J, 2015, PROCEEDINGS OF 2015 INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM - COLLEGE FOREIGN LANGUAGES EDUCATION REFORM AND INNOVATION, P1; Peng BZ, 2017, INT J EMERG TECHNOL, V12, P41, DOI 10.3991/ijet.v12.i09.748; Romero, 2017, THEORY PRACTICE LANG, V7, P96; Ruqing L, 2018, J CHONGQING COLL ELE, V27, P11; Siregar R., 2017, ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEA, V10, P175, DOI [10.5539/elt.v10n7p175, DOI 10.5539/ELT.V10N7P175; Sun H, 2019, INT J EMERG TECHNOL, V14, P182, DOI 10.3991/ijet.v14i17.1120; Thomas HS, 2019, BRIT J SURG, V106, pE103, DOI 10.1002/bjs.1105; Wang JF, 2019, ACS PHOTONICS, V6, P1736, DOI 10.1021/acsphotonics.9b0045; Wang K., 2017, SCI INNOV, V5, P26; Wang W, 2017, BIOMED ENVIRON SCI, V30, P570, DOI 10.3967/bes2017.07; Wen-Can LI., 2019, J ANHUI U TECHNOL, V36, P8; Xiao-Ting S, 2018, J XIANGNAN U, V39, P9; Xu LL, 2020, INNOV EDUC TEACH INT, V57, P724, DOI 10.1080/14703297.2019.159321; Yin H, 2014, IEEE NETWORK, V28, P14, DOI 10.1109/MNET.2014.686312; Yuan Y., 2019, TEACH FORESTRY REGIO, V32, P17; Yun-Cui Z, 2017, HLONGJIANG ENCE, V8, P3; Zhang ZP, 2017, CHIN J OCEANOL LIMN, V35, P163, DOI 10.1007/s00343-016-5241-",31,1,1,5,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

When attempting to take an exit, a driver's line of sight may be obscured by the curvature or slope of the main expressway, roadside vegetation, traffic signs, and other vehicles traveling alongside. These increase the likelihood of accidents due to inaccurate or poor driver judgement when approaching a highway exit. Because of emotional responses that accompany the possibility of missing an exit, many drivers act irrationally through haphazard acceleration or braking, aggressive lane changes; in some cases, even coming to a complete stop and reversing against the flow of high speed traffic to correct their course. This study applies to curved highway exit corridors with a poor line of sight. The total visible area of the exit ramp is defined in accordance with the design specifications of both the highway routes and exit ramps, which was then further refined by considering the driving characteristics of both the drivers and of surrounding traffic. This study set out to establish a reliable occlusion model of highway exits with the following goals in mind. Geometric equations describing the area and volume of the target area of the exit ramp are established. Discrete expression equation was deployed to establish the occlusion model for the target area within the visual field. Parameters taken from specifications of the Hunan section of the Shanghai-Kunming Expressway are used for multiple calculations, in which obstruction patterns of objects with the same width, and objects with different width at different positions are analyzed. Based on the patterns observed from stimulated experiments mentioned above, multiple effective measures were proposed to prevent the obstruction of the highway exit ramp. In summary, this study provides theoretical support for prevention of obstruction as well as an anti-occlusion model for better identification of the highway exit ramps by intelligent vehicle systems.","[Xiao, Jian; Huang, Zhongxiang] Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Traff & Transportat Engn, Changsha 410114, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Jian] Guangxi Univ, Sch Resource Environm & Mat, Nanning, Peoples R China; [Li, Yu; Yang, Liulin] Guangxi Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Nanning, Peoples R China; [He, Juanxia; Yang, Jian] Guangxi Polytech Construct, Nanning, Peoples R China","Huang, ZX (corresponding author), Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Traff & Transportat Engn, Changsha 410114, Hunan, Peoples R China.",447442396@qq.com,,,,,"Alves LF, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P62, DOI 10.1177/002072091878745; [Anonymous], 2017, JTGD202017 MIN TRAN; [Anonymous], 2014, JTGTD21201; Bao B, 2011, HIGHWAY, V56, P13; Hassan Y, 2001, J TRANSP ENG, V127, P295, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2001)127:4(295; Liang Y., 2014, IEEE T KNOWL DATA EN, V28, P50; Lin X, 2016, STUDY OPTIMIZATION ; Liu X., 2012, HIGHWAY, V57, P5; Pan B., 2016, HIGHWAY ENG, V42, P3; Qadeer RA, 2018, INT J ADOLESC YOUTH, V23, P99, DOI 10.1080/02673843.2017.129724; Qi LH, 2018, COMPOS SCI TECHNOL, V159, P142, DOI 10.1016/j.compscitech.2018.02.02; Shen Q., 2015, J SAF ENV, V14, P8; Shen Q., 2012, CHINESE FOREIGN HIGH, V37, P30; Tian Z., 2013, ROAD STEAM TRANSP, V29, P8; Wang JL, 2017, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V9, DOI 10.3390/su906089; Wu Y., 2014, ROAD STEAM TRANSP, V30, P10; Yan G, 2018, SHANGHAI CONSTRUCT S, V39, P6; Yin H S, 2017, ENG CONSTRUCT, V31, P8; Zeng SZ, 2018, TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO, V24, P969, DOI 10.3846/20294913.2016.121647",19,0,0,3,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Meanwhile, the application of lightweight network to pattern recognition has become a trend with the development of mobile networks. In order to improve the recognition accuracy of the lightweight network model MobileNetV2 and reduce the computational cost and delay caused by extracting rich features, an improved lightweight network model based on MobileNetV2 is proposed, in which an improved reverse residual module (C-Inverted residual block) is applied to replace the traditional module. In the improved reverse residual module, channel split operation is added to reduce MAC, and channel shuffle operations are used to promote information exchange and channel fusion. Experiments were carried out on Pascal VOC 2007 detection data set to test the general performance of the proposed improved model. Under the operation limits of 140 MFLOPS, 40 MFLOPS and 20 MFLOPS, mean average precision (mAP) of the improved MobileNetV2 algorithm increased by 1.2%, 2.2% and 4.3% compared with MobileNetV2. While the recognition accuracy of the proposed network model on self-made dataset of student classroom behavior states is 4.6% and 3.7% higher than that of MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2 respectively, and the average recognition rate of students' classroom behavior states can be up to 92.7%. The results of this research combined with mobile networks would be expected to be used to evaluate teaching and learning effects and promote teaching quality improvement.","[Cao, Dan; Liu, Jianfei; Wang, Chen] Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Tianjin 300401, Peoples R China; [Hao, Luguo] Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Informat Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Wenbin] Guangzhou Hison Comp Technol Co Ltd, R&D Dept, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Yang, Wenrong] Hebei Univ Technol, State Key Lab Reliabil & Intelligence Elect Equip, Tianjin, Peoples R China","Liu, JF (corresponding author), Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Tianjin 300401, Peoples R China.",jfliu@hebut.edu.cn,,,"Research and practice of higher education teaching reform of Hebei Province, China [2018GJJG060]; Postgraduate demonstration course project of Hebei Province, China [KCJSX2020014]; Guangzhou Science and Technology plan project [201802020008]; Key Project of Science and Technology Research of Hebei Higher Education, China [ZD2017021]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This paper is supported by Research and practice of higher education teaching reform of Hebei Province, China (Grant no: 2018GJJG060), Postgraduate demonstration course project of Hebei Province, China (Grant no: KCJSX2020014), Guangzhou Science and Technology plan project(Grant no: 201802020008) and Key Project of Science and Technology Research of Hebei Higher Education, China (Grant no: ZD2017021).","Ashwin TS, 2020, EDUC INF TECHNOL, V25, P1387, DOI 10.1007/s10639-019-10004-; Bangqi L., 2019, INT J AUDIO VISUAL E, V40, P8; Bo Wen, 2020, Innovative Computing.

In SDN, different applications require the controller to deploy corresponding flow entries to maintain the effectiveness of network. However, the matching field range covered by entries of different applications may overlap, and when actions specified by these overlapping entries are inconsistent, conflicts may occur. Such conflicts may cause the flow to match the wrong entry, thereby affecting the correct expression of application functions. The scheme we proposed in this paper will be able to detect and resolve conflicts between flow entries. Firstly, we discussed the causes of conflicts, and then classified various conflict situations. This classification will help us to adopt different ways of resolving different types of conflicts and make the resolution of conflicts more targeted. Next, we propose a conflict detection algorithm based on B+ tree. This algorithm can detect different types of conflicts. According to theoretical proof, the use of B+ tree compared with other similar structures better in the performance of the time and space complexity. Finally, for the detected conflicting entries, we propose a conflict resolution scheme based on the failure degree of the flow entry according to the characteristics of SDN services tending to be more detailed. Through experimental evaluation, our scheme can effectively detect and resolve conflicts with lower overhead.","[Tang, Lie; Fu, You; Zeng, Youwen; Li, Zhihao; Li, Shuangqing] Chongqing Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chongqing, Peoples R China","Tang, L (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",mercury@cqu.edu.cn,,,,,"[Anonymous], 2014, P ACM 3 WORKSH HOT ; Diouf S, 2020, INT CONF ADV COMMUN, P566, DOI 10.23919/ICACT48636.2020.906145; Farhadi H, 2014, INT CONF CLOUD ENG, P598, DOI 10.1109/IC2E.2014.2; Khurshid A, 2012, ACM SIGCOMM COMP COM, V42, P467, DOI 10.1145/2377677.237776; Kreutz D, 2015, P IEEE, V103, P14, DOI 10.1109/JPROC.2014.237199; Laghari AA, 2019, SYST PRACT ACT RES, V32, P501, DOI 10.1007/s11213-018-9471-; McKeown N, 2008, ACM SIGCOMM COMP COM, V38, P69, DOI 10.1145/1355734.135574; Mogul Jeffrey C, 2013, P 12 ACM WORKSH HOT, DOI DOI 10.1145/253577; Natarajan S., 2012, 2012 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC), P690, DOI 10.1109/ICCNC.2012.616751; Pisharody S, 2019, IEEE T DEPEND SECURE, V16, P1011, DOI 10.1109/TDSC.2017.272606; Pisharody S, 2016, IEEE CONF COMM NETW, P19, DOI 10.1109/CNS.2016.786046; Scher AD, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P367, DOI 10.1177/002072091877504; Schwabe A, 2016, PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM, IRTF & ISOC APPLIED NETWORKING RESEARCH WORKSHOP (ANRW'16), P26, DOI 10.1145/2959424.295943; Son S, 2013, IEEE IC; Varghese G., 2004, MORGAN KAUFMANN SER; Wang SY, 2016, PROCEEDINGS 2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORKING AND NETWORK APPLICATIONS NANA 2016, P299, DOI 10.1109/NaNA.2016.4; Yang T., 2012, IC NETWORK PROTOCO; Yao SB, 1978, P 1978 ACM SIGMOD IN, P6; Zhu DH, 2019, INT CONF COMP SCI ED, P731, DOI 10.1109/ICCSE.2019.884544",19,0,0,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In this paper, a novel pedagogy has been proposed, which can work for both online and offline classes based on the social constructivist methods. The methods followed in the proposed pedagogy are classified into two types, viz. social examples and technical drama. One of the courses of first-year engineering undergraduates, Basic Electrical Engineering (BEE), has been taken into consideration for the practical implementation of this pedagogy. A detailed explanation of the above mentioned two methods has been presented in this paper as teaching experiments (TE), with the support of different topics of the course considered. The teachers of the courses such as BEE can follow the methods described in this paper to facilitate active learning, leading to a good understanding of the concepts. The methods have been designed such as to make both teachers and students active participants in the process of teaching and learning in both online and offline classrooms.

Education informatization has gradually become one of the core factors that determine the quality of education. There is a close connection with the regional economy. The western region of my country (mainly including the mountainous areas in the southwest and the arid areas in the northwest) shows regional characteristics such as fragile ecological environment, lagging economic development, and large gaps in infrastructure and public services. Informatization of education is urgently needed to promote regional economic development. By comparing the gross product and educational expenditure of Zhejiang province and Gansu Province, this paper concludes the interdependence and mutual promotion between the development of educational informationization and regional economic development. On this basis, this paper analyzes the necessity of the informationization of education and the coordinated development of regional economy in the ecologically fragile areas of western China. Finally, from five aspects, it puts forward an effective way to promote the development of education informatization and regional economy, aiming at realizing the coordinated development of education informatization and regional economy.

Currently majority of these firms follow a manual approach of hiring employees which is more prone to errors and time consuming. Prime purpose of the research is to develop an intelligent predictive model to decide upon candidate's suitability for an applied It based job. A sample size of 13,168 instances with 19 attributes of job seekers data are used for study. An ensemble predictive meta model approach is presented in the research where a stacked KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours) algorithm combined with hard voting approach is employed. The idea is to use a single unified predictive model in place of separate classification models by considering the predicted class with maximum votes against each class label. The proposed approach comprises two functional modules. 'Stacked KNN Learner Module' involves the use of five variants of KNN which include 1-NN, 3-NN, 5-NN, 7-NN and 9-NN. Individual prediction of the job seeker data from these variants of KNN algorithm are input to the 'Hard Voting Ensemble Predictive unit' which eventually aggregates majority of predicted class votes determined for each class label to generate the final output predicted class label on basis of maximum votes. The developed ensemble meta model is successfully implemented using python programming language and its performance evaluation is done using various metrics. The implemented model generated a 96.96% prediction accuracy rate. The specificity, sensitivity and f-score value recorded was 96.36%, 96.06% and 96.26% respectively. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root mean Square Error (RMSE) value observed with our proposed meta model was 0.0048 and 0.0102 respectively. A comparative analysis of the proposed model was done by varying the data sample size and it gave a consistent performance throughout. It was observed that proposed ensemble model gave an impressive 96.96% mean accuracy rate and the overall performance of other variants was consistent. Performance of proposed meta model was also compared with some existing techniques like C.45, CART and K-Means. It outperformed other techniques in terms of accurately predicting the class label of candidates applying for job. This ensemble meta model can be of great help for growing IT firms and assist the organization unit in hiring right and deserving candidates in future. Proposed work can act as a decision making framework in multi sector units with enormous work force to streamline performance appraisal process thereby enabling in hiring right people for right job.","[Mishra, Sushruta; Mallick, Pradeep K.; Tripathy, Hrudaya K.] Deemed Univ, Sch Comp Engn, Kalinga Inst Ind Technol, Bhubaneswar 751024, India; [Jena, Lambodar] SOA Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Bhubaneswar, India; [Chae, Gyoo-Soo] Baekseok Univ, Div Informat & Commun Engn, Cheonan, South Korea","Mishra, S (corresponding author), Deemed Univ, Sch Comp Engn, Kalinga Inst Ind Technol, Bhubaneswar 751024, India.",sushruta.mishrafcs@kiit.ac.in,"Tripathy, Hrudaya Kumar/AAD-2590-2019; Mallick, Pradeep/AAU-7923-2021; Jena, Lambodar/ABH-2564-2021",,,,"Aaboud M, 2016, J HIGH ENERGY PHYS, P1, DOI 10.1007/JHEP09(2016)00; Ab Aziz MTR, 2016, AIP CONF PROC, V1761, DOI 10.1063/1.496084; Ade R, 2014, 2014 FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORKS & SOFT COMPUTING (ICNSC), P384, DOI 10.1109/CNSC.2014.690665; Agaoglu M, 2016, IEEE ACCESS, V4, P2379, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2016.256875; Alalwan N, 2019, IEEE ACCESS, V7, P98725, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.292814; Almalis N, 2016, 6 INT C INF INT SYST, DOI [10.1109/IISA.2015.7388018, DOI 10.1109/IISA.2015.7388018; [Anonymous], 2010, PROCEEDING 19 ACM IN, DOI DOI 10.1145/1871437.187174; Ayesha S., 2010, EUR J SCI RES, V43, P2; Aziz AA, 2015, J TEKNOL, V75, P1; Ben-Zadok G, 2009, RES REFLECT INNOV IN, P; Breaugh JA, 2009, HUM RESOUR MANAGE R, V19, P219, DOI 10.1016/j.hrmr.2009.02.00; Brozina C, 2019, IEEE ACCESS, V7, P163686, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.294587; Cavnar W.B., 1994, P 3 ANN S DOC AN INF, V48113, P16; Chaudhari P., 2016, 2016 IEEE 1 INT C PO, P; Conijn Rianne, 2017, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, V10, P17, DOI 10.1109/TLT.2016.261631; Dietz-Uhler B, 2013, J INTERACT ONLINE LE, V12, P1; Dudley NM, 2006, J APPL PSYCHOL, V91, P40, DOI 10.1037/0021-9010.91.1.4; Guo SQ, 2016, EXPERT SYST APPL, V60, P169, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2016.04.01; Huang S, 2013, COMPUT EDUC, V61, P133, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2012.08.01; Jantawan B., 2013, INT J COMPUT SCI INF, V11, P; Jantawan B., 2007, INT J INNOV RES COMP, V3297, P458; Kanimozhi KV, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091989419; Katore Lokesh S., 2015, Proceedings of 2015 Global Conference on Communication Technologies (GCCT), P503, DOI 10.1109/GCCT.2015.734279; Kazi Asma Shahid, 2017, J RES REFLECT ED, V2, P18; Khan Z.

The application of new media technologies has impacted traditional TV news media, which not only faces great challenges, but also brings some lessons for the development of TV news media. New media technology relies on powerful information processing technology and data storage technology to develop and grow continuously. Compared with traditional news, new media technology has more powerful information storage capacity and dissemination capacity. Firstly, this paper briefly introduces the concept of new media technology, summarizes the typical characteristics of new media technology, and analyzes the existing problems in the application of new media technology in the news communication industry based on the necessity of applying new media technology.

In particular, the situation can be more crucial for electrical power engineering education due to the importance of the direct relationship between the students and their instructor embodied in the campus' classroom interaction and the requisite face-to-face learning. Apparently, e-learning instructional design has provided a fairly accepted solution through online lectures and exams for power engineering courses. Nevertheless, the difficulty persists in moving the experiment equipment of the laboratories to the homes of the students since most experiments were likely to be carried out on the University campus' dedicated power system panels. An urgent and reduced cost solution is therefore needed. This paper introduces a shortcut design method as a compensatory solution at no extra cost, which during this challenging period is suitable for teaching power system labs and also suitable for full online education programs. The work presented in the paper goes beyond that to discuss the relevance to ABET student outcomes. Two experiments are presented in the PowerWorld Simulator environment with systematic steps to facilitate the expansion of the rest of the laboratory experiments. The method is based on the simulation of a textbook example and the verification of results from another textbook followed by a discussion of the relevant students' outcomes of ABET. The paper may be used as an educational guide for instructors in the following academic year in institutions that embrace distance learning programs.","[Mohamed, Omar; Bitar, Zain; Abu-Sultaneh, Alla; Elhaija, Wejdan Abu] Princess Sumaya Univ Technol, King Abdullah II Sch Engn, Amman 11941, Jordan","Mohamed, O (corresponding author), Princess Sumaya Univ Technol, King Abdullah II Sch Engn, Amman 11941, Jordan.",o.mohamed@psut.edu.jo,"Mohamed, Omar/T-5774-2019; Abu El Haija, Wejdan/AAA-5982-2020","Mohamed, Omar/0000-0003-0618-2012; Abu El Haija, Wejdan/0000-0001-7990-3138",,,"ABET Accreditation Website, 1996, CRIT 3 STUD OUT; Beru RG., 2013, P 120 ASEE ANN C EX; Glover JD, 2017, CENGAGE LEARNING, V6t; Grainger J.J., 1994, POWER SYSTEM ANA; Guney I, 2014, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V51, P134, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.51.2.; Karnavas YL, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V57, P202, DOI 10.1177/002072091879142; Milano F, 2008, IEEE T EDUC, V51, P17, DOI 10.1109/TE.2007.89335; Ngundam JM, 2001, POWER ENG J, V15, P211, DOI 10.1049/pe:2001040; Oliveira TL, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091987905; Omer M, 2011, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V48, P423, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.48.4.",10,3,3,1,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Video monitoring, criminal identification, building access control, and unmanned and autonomous vehicles are only a few examples of concrete applications that are becoming increasingly attractive to industry. Various techniques are being developed, including local, holistic, and hybrid approaches, which use only a few face image characteristics or the entire facial features to provide a face image description. Many methods have good results, if there are sufficiently representative training samples per person, in the face recognition system. Facial part finding and extraction show the utmost vital role in face and age recognition. In this research work a new algorithm is proposed for Face and Age Recognition (FAR) by using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine (RBF-SVM) classifier, and Rotational Local Binary Pattern (RLBP). RLBP is utilized for the selection and extraction of features from the face image. In this algorithm, extract the face component like Nose, Mouth, Left and Right eye. In the preprocessing stage median filter is used to remove noises from the face image. By using this, there is an improvement in the feature extraction procedure. In pattern recognition, a basic errand is finding a picture from the picture parts. For the implementation of results FG-NET ((Face and Gesture Recognition Network) and AT&T datasets are used. The detection rate of face recognition has reached up to 92-98% and the detection rate for age recognition is 87%. The proposed algorithm is compared with SVM shows better over previous algorithms and also estimate the value of accuracy.","[Beniwal, Sonal] Uttarakhand Syst Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Singh, Ajit] Bipin Tripathi Kumaon Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dwarahat, Almora, India; [Kant, Chander] Kurukshetra Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Applicat, Kurukshetra, Haryana, India","Beniwal, S (corresponding author), BPSMV, Dept CSE & IT, Sonipat 131305, Haryana, India.",sonalkharb@gmail.com,,,,,"Burges CJC, 1998, DATA MIN KNOWL DISC, V2, P121, DOI 10.1023/A:100971592355; Fu Y, 2010, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V32, P1955, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.2010.3; Gong DH, 2015, PROC CVPR IEEE, P5289, DOI 10.1109/CVPR.2015.729916; Ingole AL., 2018, GLOB C WIR COMP NET; Jain A.K., 2008, HDB BIOMETRIC; Jain A.K, 2011, HDB FACE RECOGNITION, V2nd ed; Julina J.K.J., 2017, COMPUTER COMMUNICATI, P; Kalansuriya TR, 2013, INT CONF ADV ICT, P44, DOI 10.1109/ICTer.2013.676115; Kandali AB, 2017, INT C EN COMM DAT A; Kumar M, 2018, IET IMAGE PROCESS, V12, P1857, DOI 10.1049/iet-ipr.2017.140; Lanitis A, 2004, IEEE T SYST MAN CY B, V34, P621, DOI 10.1109/TSMCB.2003.81709; Lin D, 2013 IEEE INT C COMP, P287; Okano T., 2018, APSIPA ANN SUMM C 1; Patil HY, 2014, INT CONF IMAG PROC, P27; Ramanathan N, 2006, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V15, P3349, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2006.88199; Thukral P, 2012, INT CONF ACOUST SPEE, P1529, DOI 10.1109/ICASSP.2012.628818; Xiang Z-Z, 2016, INT C MACH LEARN CY",17,2,2,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Taking 400 students and 50 teachers as the subjects of investigation, through my own English classroom teaching practice, observation and investigation, this paper explores and analyses the real situation of multimedia English teaching from many aspects, and reflects on how to improve multimedia English teaching more effectively in the multimedia environment. In English teaching, we should correctly view the position of multimedia in teaching, correctly understand the traditional English teaching relative to multimedia, organically combine multimedia English teaching with traditional English teaching, and pay attention to people-oriented, teacher-student interaction and emotional exchange in multimedia classroom teaching. Finally, according to the survey results, we can know that what is important is not the improvement of teaching methods and equipment but whether the teaching concept is updated.","[An, Lu] Xian Univ, Sch Foreign Studies, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Genrong] Jiangxi Univ TCM, Coll Humanities, Nanchang 330004, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","Zhang, GR (corresponding author), Jiangxi Univ TCM, Coll Humanities, Nanchang 330004, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",674983216@qq.com,,,,,"Abdallah MMS, 2014, ONLINE SUBMISSION, P3; Athanases SZ, 2015, J LIT RES, V47, P83, DOI 10.1177/1086296X1559091; Chen Y., 2014, AMR, V926-930, P463; Cole DR, 2014, ENGL AUST, V49, P7; Dvorghets OS, 2015, PROCD SOC BEHV, V200, P192, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.08.05; Giannakos MN, 2015, INT REV RES OPEN DIS, V16, P26; Halwani N., 2017, ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEA, V10, P5; Ince M, 2014, PROCD SOC BEHV, V141, P670, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.05.11; Incecay V, 2017, EDUC INF TECHNOL, V22, P901, DOI 10.1007/s10639-016-9463-; Ivanaj S, 2019, J ORGAN END USER COM, V31, P83, DOI 10.4018/JOEUC.201904010; Kabooha R., 2018, ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEA, V11, P72, DOI DOI 10.5539/ELT.V11N2P7; Li RQ, 2014, AMM, V701-702, P126; Likitrattanaporn W, 2017, ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEA, V10, P96, DOI DOI 10.5539/ELT.V10N7P9; Lin YN, 2019, INTERACT LEARN ENVIR, V27, P995, DOI 10.1080/10494820.2018.146111; Liu Jing Hui, 2014, Applied Mechanics and Materials, V644-650, P5773, DOI 10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.644-650.577; Lou MS, 2017, INT J EMERG TECHNOL, V12, P119, DOI 10.3991/ijet.v12i01.648; Navidinia Hossein, 2016, Med J Islam Repub Iran, V30, P46; Orji CT, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P334, DOI 10.1177/002072091877398; Peng JP, 2019, J ORGAN END USER COM, V31, P61, DOI 10.4018/JOEUC.201901010; Tao JS, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072092090143; Veselovska G, 2016, EDUC INF TECHNOL, V21, P1387, DOI 10.1007/s10639-015-9389-; Wang Q, 2015, UNIVERSAL J ED RES, V3, P473, DOI DOI 10.13189/UJER.2015.03080; Wei J., 2014, CATESOL J, V26, P6; Wilkinson SD, 2014, EDUC REV, V66, P411, DOI 10.1080/00131911.2013.78797; Yang CCR, 2017, J INF TECHNOL EDUC-I, V16, P; Yu DM, 2019, ENERGY, V173, P554, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2019.02.09",26,1,1,14,38,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Agricultural production structure is closely related to water resources and grain yield. Optimizing agricultural industrial structure is related to the national economy and people's livelihood, and has a great impact on the economic development of a region. In this paper, an optimization model based on conjugate cooperative game is established to verify the influence on the development of agricultural industrial structure, and propose solutions. The research has good innovation and guidance. In view of the unreasonable regional industrial structure, starting with the fundamental theoretical research of the regional industrial structure adjustment, a conjugate matching cooperative game method is used to establish a regional industrial structure optimization model. The results suggest that: Wheat planting area is increased by 1.1%, maize planting area is decreased by 40.5%, beans planting area is increased by 16.5%, potato planting area is increased by 18.3%, oil crops planting area is decreased by 5.5%, vegetable planting area is increased by 4.2%, and forage planting area is increased by 5.9%. The proportion of food crops: cash crops: forage is adjusted from 50.0: 11.7: 38.3 to 27.1: 28.7: 44.2, and the structure of agriculture and animal husbandry tends to be rationalized. In this paper, the conjugate matching cooperative game method is used to analyze the model, and the optimization method of regional industrial structure is proposed, which can help agricultural industry to improve production and promote the further optimization of industrial structure.","[Wang, Lin] Haikou Univ Econ, Sch Business Adm, Haikou 571127, Hainan, Peoples R China","Wang, L (corresponding author), Haikou Univ Econ, Sch Business Adm, Haikou 571127, Hainan, Peoples R China.",whu05@qq.com,,,planned project of philosophy and social sciences of Hainan Province: Research on Optimization and Adjustment of Industrial Structure in Hainan Province Constrained by Resources and Environment [HNSK(YB)19-44]; special project of philosophy and social sciences of Hainan Province: The Innovative Research on the Evolution of Island Ecological Civilization and the Division of Green Industry Recycling Type [HNSK(ZX)18-118],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was awarded the planned project of philosophy and social sciences of Hainan Province: Research on Optimization and Adjustment of Industrial Structure in Hainan Province Constrained by Resources and Environment (Grant NO.

Methods 126 primiparas were admitted to our hospital from June 2018 to November 2019 by random sampling method. According to the order of admission of primiparas, they were divided into conventional group (63 cases) and study group (63 cases). The routine group of primiparas were given routine delivery care, while the research group of primiparas were given doula accompanied care by midwives. The time of labor, pregnancy outcome, delivery pain score, delivery control and anxiety score of the two groups were compared and analyzed. Results Compared with the conventional group, the time of the first, second and total labor was significantly shorter in the study group (P < 0.05). The amount of postpartum hemorrhage in the study group was significantly less than that in the conventional group (P < 0.05). The rate of perineal incision and perineal laceration in the study group was significantly lower than that in the conventional group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in Apgar score <8 points compared with the control group (P > 0.05). The scores of pain and anxiety in the second stage of labor were significantly lower in the study group than in the conventional group (P < 0.05). The control score of the puerpera in the study group was significantly higher than that in the conventional group (P < 0.05). Conclusion The intervention measures of companion doula led by midwives can effectively shorten the time of labor, reduce the anxiety and pain score and improve the sense of control during labor of primiparas. This nursing method has clinical promotion and application value.","[Zhang, Lei; Tian, Dan] Capital Med Univ, Beijing Luhe Hosp, Tongshige St, Beijing 101149, Tongzhou Distri, Peoples R China","Tian, D (corresponding author), Capital Med Univ, Beijing Luhe Hosp, Tongshige St, Beijing 101149, Tongzhou Distri, Peoples R China.",z15910774655@163.com,,,,,"Celik E, 2018, ENG SCI TECHNOL, V21, P1104, DOI 10.1016/j.jestch.2018.08.00; Chunlei X, 2012, QILU NURS J, V18, P5; Gailing L, 2020, CAPITAL FOOD MED, V27, P18; Lio-Xiang W, 2019, HEILONGJIANG MED SCI, V42, P16; Mi L, 2020, CONT NURSES, V27, P8; Mosaad AM, 2019, AIN SHAMS ENG J, V10, P755, DOI 10.1016/j.asej.2019.07.00; Qing-Qing X, 2019, CONT MED, V25, P3; Ruixia A, 2018, MOD MED IMAGING, V27, P294; Shumin Y, 2020, CAPITAL FOOD MED, V27, P17; Sun Y, 2020, HENAN MED RES, V29, P56; Wenmin X, 2020, CHIN FOREIGN MED RES, V18, P7; Xiangyue L., 2020, MOD MED HLTH, V36, P43; Xiexiu Y, 2013, CHIN MED INNOVATION, V10, P12; Xinmei Z, 2019, NURS PRACT RES, V16, P9; Yanmei L., 2019, CHIN FOREIGN MED RES, V17, P17; Yuan Y, 2019, PROG MOD BIOMED, V19, P93; Yue R, 2020, MED EQUIP, V33, P18; Zhang YS, 2020, IEEE T MULTIMEDIA, V22, P2844, DOI 10.1109/TMM.2020.296688; Zhen-Ye M, 2019, J PRACT CLIN MED, V23, P11",19,0,0,4,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

To ensure smooth construction unloading, the deflection deformation of the large span floor and the field splicing node are monitored. Results show that the prefabricated construction method of the Mianyang Fule International School Gymnasium and the steel column-scaffold combination support system are affordable. After unloading, the floor has the traits of plates and relatively greater rigid reserve. Thus, it is applicable for large-span and high-load floor structure. The stress in the splicing node in the inflection point (L/2, L is the size of the grid) is relatively small, the bolt and the shearing-resistance plate have no slump, and the field splicing node is safe and reliable.

Thus, the efficiency in student loan market is very important for the development of higher education, especially, human capital formation in this process. To complement the centerpiece for the relationship between human capital formation, credit market and economic performance in long run, a model which is derived from Boyd and Smith' to explore the role of information cost in the market. This work tried to indicate the fact that, higher development in credit market reduces the information cost in student loans, which would lead to higher contribution of human capital formation to economic growth.","[Feng, Xiao; Huang, Bo; Meng, Weidong] Chongqing Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Chongqing, Peoples R China","Meng, WD (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",157085670@qq.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573025]; National Social Science Foundation of China [17XGL008]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2018CDXYJG0040]; Chongqing Graduate Research Innovation Project [CYB14005],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71573025), National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 17XGL008), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2018CDXYJG0040), and the Chongqing Graduate Research Innovation Project (CYB14005).","BARRO RJ, 1991, Q J ECON, V106, P407, DOI 10.2307/293794; Barro RJ, 2013, J DEV ECON, V104, P184, DOI 10.1016/j.jdeveco.2012.10.00; Boyd JH, 1998, ECON THEOR, V11, P241, DOI 10.1007/s00199005018; Briscoe G, 2003, INT J MANPOWER, V24, P568, DOI 10.1108/0143772031049109; Brooks L., 2013, STUDENT LOANS OVERV; GREENWOOD J, 1990, J POLIT ECON, V98, P1076, DOI 10.1086/26172; Greenwood J, 2010, AM ECON REV, V100, P1875, DOI 10.1257/aer.100.4.187; Grimpe C, 2019, STRATEGIC MANAGE J, V40, P685, DOI 10.1002/smj.295; Gross JPK, 2009, J STUD FINANC AID, V39, P1; Hanushek E.A., 2010, HIGH COST LOW ED PE; Hanushek EA, 2008, J ECON LIT, V46, P607, DOI 10.1257/jel.46.3.60; Heller DE, 1970, FINANCIAL AID PICTU; KRUGMAN P, 1994, FOREIGN AFF, V73, P62, DOI 10.2307/2004692; LEVINE R, 1991, J FINANC, V46, P1445, DOI 10.2307/232886; Levine R, 2004, 10766 NAT BUR EC RES, DOI [10.3386/w10766, DOI 10.3386/W10766; Lucas RE, 2002, ECONOMETRICA, V70, P1445, DOI 10.1111/1468-0262.0033; MANKIW NG, 1992, Q J ECON, V107, P407, DOI 10.2307/211847; Riley SM, 2017, STRATEGIC MANAGE J, V38, P1895, DOI 10.1002/smj.263; SCHULTZ TW, 1962, J POLIT ECON, V70, P1, DOI 10.1086/25872; Sultana S, 2017, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V54, P105, DOI 10.1177/002072091668848; WILLIAMSON SD, 1987, Q J ECON, V102, P135, DOI 10.2307/188468; WILLIAMSON SD, 1986, J MONETARY ECON, V18, P159, DOI 10.1016/0304-3932(86)90074-; Woo J.H., 2002, J STUDENT FINANCIAL, V32, P; Xu YF, 2020, J COMPUT APPL MATH, V365, DOI 10.1016/j.cam.2019.11238; Yadav D, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P44, DOI 10.1177/002072091775095",25,0,0,3,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Based on a two-sector theoretical model, this paper explores the factors restraining the transformation from traditional to modern agriculture and their relationship with economic growth. Using a sample of 31 provinces and cities in mainland China from 1990 to 2016, the results show that the relative price of industrial and agricultural products has a direct impact on the willingness of people to adopt modern technology. Specifically, the relative price of industrial and agricultural products forms a single combined threshold for agricultural modernisation, while the relative productivity of industry and agriculture form a double threshold for per capita GDP, these also show a significant nonlinear relationship. Moreover, the agricultural modernisation of the provinces and cities in the mainland of China is not randomly distributed. There are hot spots with high-value aggregations. The relative productivity has a significant spillover effect on per capita income, and has a negative impact on per capita income in neighbouring areas. Agricultural modernisation can breakthrough economic stagnation and become the driving force for the economy to enter a new round of growth.","[Li, Qian; Zeng, Miao; Du, Jiang] Sichuan Univ, Sch Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China","Du, J (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Sch Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",scucity@163.com,,,,,"[Anonymous], 1990, CONTINUITY CHANCE C; Belagra M, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P293, DOI 10.1177/002072091877305; Benin S, 2015, AGR ECON-BLACKWELL, V46, P103, DOI 10.1111/agec.1220; Bergius M, 2018, J PEASANT STUD, V45, P825, DOI 10.1080/03066150.2016.126055; Cao J, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P285, DOI 10.1177/002072091880353; Chen YH, 2019, AGR ECON-CZECH, V65, P340, DOI 10.17221/399/2018-AGRICECO; Clark G, 2007, PRINC ECON HIST W W; [丁志伟 Ding Zhiwei], 2016, [地理科学进展, Progress in Geography], V35, P; Fan SG, 1997, J DEV ECON, V53, P115, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3878(97)00005-; Galor O, 2011, UNIFIED GROWTH THEORY, P; Galor O, 2000, AM ECON REV, V90, P806, DOI 10.1257/aer.90.4.80; Gao WanLin, 2010, Research of Agricultural Modernization, V31, P25; Hall RE, 1999, Q J ECON, V114, P83, DOI 10.1162/00335539955595; Hansen GD, 2002, AM ECON REV, V92, P1205, DOI 10.1257/0002828026034473; Hossain J, 2017, INT J RENEW ENERGY R, V7, P72; Jones C., 2001, BE J MACROECON ADV, V1, P1, DOI DOI 10.2202/1534-6013.102; Knickel K, 2018, J RURAL STUD, V59, P197, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.04.01; Kogel T, 2001, J ECON GROWTH, V6, P337, DOI 10.1023/A:101274253100; LIN JYF, 1992, AM ECON REV, V82, P3; Lucas Robert E., 2004, EC ED B, VXLIV, P; Maddison Angus, 2001, WORLD EC MILLENNIA; Rivera M, 2018, J RURAL STUD, V59, P242, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.07.00; Takeshima H, 2020, AGR SYST, V177, DOI 10.1016/j.agsy.2019.10269; Takeshima H, 2017, AGR ECON-BLACKWELL, V48, P363, DOI 10.1111/agec.1233; Wang XB, 2016, AGR ECON-BLACKWELL, V47, P309, DOI 10.1111/agec.1223; Wu S., 2001, REV DEV ECON, V5, P375, DOI [10.1111/1467-9361.00130, DOI 10.1111/1467-9361.00130; Yadav D, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P44, DOI 10.1177/002072091775095; Yang DT, 2013, J MONETARY ECON, V60, P367, DOI 10.1016/j.jmoneco.2013.01.00; Young A, 2003, J POLIT ECON, V111, P1220, DOI 10.1086/37853; Zhang XB, 2017, CHINA ECON REV, V43, P184, DOI 10.1016/j.chieco.2017.01.01",30,0,0,18,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The advent of the era of Internet and cloud computing has brought a major change to China. However, with the advent of the era of big data, a bigger technological change is coming. The arrival of the era of big data has brought a certain impact on China's enterprise management and decision-making, and put forward higher requirements for China's enterprise management and decision-making. Therefore, enterprises need to constantly strive to improve themselves so as to better adapt to the era of big data. In order to keep pace with the development of The Times, major companies and enterprises need to constantly change their internal management methods in order to achieve sustainable and stable development in their own fields and make their management decisions smoother. Among them, optimization and reform of the application of big data are particularly important. Starting from the characteristics of big data and its role in enterprise management decisions, this paper analyzes the current situation of big data management within enterprises and discusses the influence of big data on enterprise management decisions from five aspects, namely, environment, data, participants, organization and technology. And this paper analyzes the construction method and design idea of enterprise decision support system based on artificial intelligence.","[Guo, Jie] Chongqing Univ Sci & Technol, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Dong] Soochow Univ, Suzhou 215006, Peoples R China","Wang, D (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Suzhou 215006, Peoples R China.",55234289@qq.com,,,China Scholarship Council,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This article was supported by the China Scholarship Council.","Achuthan K, 2020, IEEE T IND APPL, V56, P1742, DOI 10.1109/TIA.2020.296615; Bingqi Y, 2014, MANAGE OBSE; Bingyu C., 2017, CHINESE FOREIGN ENTR, V6, P1; Cui F., 2019, P 2019 3 INT C EC MA, P92; Information Technology-Enterprise Information Management, 2019, COMPUT NETW COMMUN, V6, P11; Li Y., 2019, P 2019 4 INT S MAN E, P51; Michaud V, 2020, NONPROFIT MANAG LEAD, V30, P377, DOI 10.1002/nml.2139; Naqvi SR, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P140, DOI 10.1177/002072091879010; Ramamurthy A, 2019, J AM WATER WORKS ASS, V111, P78, DOI 10.1002/awwa.131; Saeidi P, 2019, COMPUT STAND INTER, V63, P67, DOI 10.1016/j.csi.2018.11.00; Swart AJ, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P244, DOI 10.1177/002072091876705; Tang M, 2021, OMEGA-INT J MANAGE S, V100, DOI 10.1016/j.omega.2019.10214; Thakar T, 2018, IFAC PAPERSONLINE, V51, P762, DOI 10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.11.20; Xiao JF, 2016, IEEE T SMART GRID, V7, P847, DOI 10.1109/TSG.2015.242498; Yadav D, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P44, DOI 10.1177/002072091775095; Yuan L, 2020, NATL CIRCULATION EC, P4; Zhiying Z, 2015, NEW FINANCIAL MANAGE, V8, P8; Zimmermann A, 2019, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V159, P2120, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2019.09.38",18,0,0,9,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The grading processing of off-line examination is time-consuming. Besides, since the off-line grading is subjective, it is error-prone. In order to address the challenges in off-line examinations of universities, primary and secondary schools, it is very urgent to improve the efficiency of off-line grading. In order to realize intelligent grading for off-line examinations, we exploit deep learning techniques to off-line grading. First, we propose an image processing method for English letters. Second, we propose a image recognition method based on deep learning for English letters. Third, we propose a lightweight framework for grading. Based on the above designs, we design an intelligent grading system based on deep learning. We implement the system and the result shows that the intelligent grading system can batch grading efficiently. Besides, compared with related designs, the proposed system is more flexible and intelligent.","[Xiao, Meng] Shenzhen Polytech, Sch Management, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Yi, Haibo] Shenzhen Polytech, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","Yi, HB (corresponding author), Shenzhen Polytech, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",haiboyi@szpt.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China [2018A030310030]; Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, China [2017GkQNCX059]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors received funding from Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (No. 2018A030310030), Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, China (No. 2017GkQNCX059).","Alharbi F, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072092090342; Baylor D, 2017, KDD'17: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD ACM SIGKDD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING, P1387, DOI 10.1145/3097983.309802; Burden J, 2010, PROCEDIA ENGINEER, V2, P2931, DOI 10.1016/j.proeng.2010.04.09; HOON TG, 1995, J CHEM EDUC, V72, P51, DOI 10.1021/ed072p5; KHOTANZAD A, 1990, PATTERN RECOGN, V23, P1089, DOI 10.1016/0031-3203(90)90005-; Khubalkar S, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V57, P3, DOI 10.1177/002072091879950; Komarudin A, 2015, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V59, P468, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2015.07.51; Kumar DS, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091989419; Oehlers D, 2006, INT J ENG EDUC, V22, P126; Offir B, 2008, COMPUT EDUC, V51, P1172, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2007.10.00; Pulli K, 2012, COMMUN ACM, V55, P61, DOI 10.1145/2184319.218433; Rampasek L, 2016, CELL SYST, V2, P12, DOI 10.1016/j.cels.2016.01.00; Sun QS, 2005, PATTERN RECOGN, V38, P2437, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2004.12.01; Tang XO, 1998, ARTIF INTELL REV, V12, P177, DOI 10.1023/A:100651721172; Vos N, 2011, COMPUT EDUC, V56, P127, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2010.08.01; Xu RY, 2020, COMPUTING, V102, P765, DOI 10.1007/s00607-019-00722-; Zhang H, 2010, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V19, P596, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2009.203670; Zuo WM, 2006, PATTERN RECOGN LETT, V27, P210, DOI 10.1016/j.patrec.2005.08.01",18,0,0,2,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Most multimedia devices on the market, with the music and sound effects, a high compression mono or stereo transmission. This mono or stereo transmission with a high compression ratio is very low quality. Since audio is far less powerful than visual impact, and the capacity of the disc used to store audio is small, people tend to focus on visual information processing, but ignore the importance of audio. Multi-channel surround sound technology has received more and more attention in the teaching practice of film and television colleges, but it is also affected by various factors such as venue facilities. This has caused bottlenecks in teaching in this field and has greatly affected the teaching effect.

Based on data from 156 questionnaires collected from Jinan University and Shanghai Jiaotong University in China, this study adopts an fsQCA approach and concludes that (1) DBA candidates' research self-efficacy stems from all three sets of factors, including learning motivations, learning strategies, and environmental factors. These factors, at either a high level or a low level, combine to generate a number of antecedent configurations; (2) environmental factors, especially mentorship effectiveness and course experience, substantially boost DBA students' research self-efficacy; (3) unlike environmental factors, learning motivations and learning strategies seem to have limited effects on the development of research self-efficacy and act more as contributing conditions than core conditions. This paper makes theoretical contributions to the research fields of both DBA and research self-efficacy.","[Liu, Hui] South China Normal Univ, Sch Educ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Tang, Minhui] Jinan Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China;

Secondly, it studies the modeling and verification of rigid body and elastic body of hypersonic vehicle, establishes the error model with disturbance observation compensation, and proposes a new attitude control scheme of hypersonic vehicle, which realizes the stable tracking of attitude angle and improves the uncertainty of key parameters of the system.

In this paper, we proposed an improved YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) applied Duplex FPN, which enhanced large object detection by utilizing low-level feature information. The conventional YOLOv3 improved the small object detection performance by applying FPN (Feature Pyramid Networks) structure to YOLOv2. However, YOLOv3 with an FPN structure specialized in detecting small objects, so it is difficult to detect large objects. Therefore, this paper proposed an improved YOLOv3 applied Duplex FPN, which can utilize low-level location information in high-level feature maps instead of the existing FPN structure of YOLOv3. This improved the detection accuracy of large objects. Also, an extra detection layer was added to the top-level feature map to prevent failure of detection of parts of large objects. Further, dimension clusters of each detection layer were reassigned to learn quickly how to accurately detect objects. The proposed method was compared and analyzed in the PASCAL VOC dataset. The experimental results showed that the bounding box accuracy of large objects improved owing to the Duplex FPN and extra detection layer, and the proposed method succeeded in detecting large objects that the existing YOLOv3 did not.","[Shin, Seokyong] Kwangwoon Univ, Dept Plasma Bio Display, Seoul, South Korea; [Han, Hyunho] Univ Ulsan, Coll Gen Educ, Ulsan, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Hun] Kwangwoon Univ, Ingenium Coll Liberal Arts, Seoul, South Korea","Lee, SH (corresponding author), Kwangwoon Univ, Ingenium Coll Liberal Arts, Seoul, South Korea.",leesh58@kw.ac.kr,,"Shin, Seokyong/0000-0002-6409-4312",Kwangwoon University,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The present research has been conducted by the Research Grant of Kwangwoon University in 2020.","Bochkovskiy A., 2020, YOLOV4 OPTIMAL SPEE; Everingham M, 2010, INT J COMPUT VISION, V88, P303, DOI 10.1007/s11263-009-0275-; Girshick R.

The serious problems of students' physical health level is still the obvious short board of students' quality,(vertical bar)poor eyesight and physical health level are still the short board of students' quality have not been overcome and solved.(2) It is of great significance to study the birth and development mechanism of students' short physical health level for enhancing students' physical fitness and promoting the healthy development of teenagers. According to the idea that the connection between causes and results is the connection between things or phenomena, the retrospective perspective based on the Triple independent teaching mode of sports and the experience and practice beyond point and level are adopted. Based on the characteristics of Triple independent teaching mode and the problems existing in the implementation of Triple independent teaching mode and the countermeasures to solve the problems, two explanatory variables of Triple independent freedom and project diversity of students are extracted. Through the analysis of the two explanatory variables caused by the qualitative comparative analysis method, it is concluded that the main position of Triple independent of students is the effective condition configuration that causes the short board of students' physical health level. The results show that the contradiction between the students' independent choice of curriculum content and the setting of sports events, the contradiction between the students' independent choice of teachers and PE teachers are the main contradiction of the Triple independent Teaching mode and the root of the defect of the Triple independent Teaching mode. The crux of the teaching reform of Triple independent lies in the understanding and interpretation of the subject status of students' Triple independent. The teaching mode of Triple independent in physical education is to teach students in the main position of Triple independent. The virtual teaching objectives and the lack of depth in teaching are the reasons for the short physical health level of students. The teaching reform of Triple independent in Physical Education in Colleges and universities, whose form is greater than content, is the reform of teaching methods, not the reform of teaching content.","[Xilin, Liu] Wuhan Polytech, Sports Dept, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China","Xilin, L (corresponding author), Wuhan Polytech, Sports Dept, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",67983901@qq.com,,,,,"[Anonymous], OPINIONS STRENGTHEN; Baosheng C., 2020, 2019 NAT ED ; Belagra M, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P293, DOI 10.1177/002072091877305; Hongxia M, 2010, J PHYS ED, V17, P7; Jian W, 2010, ED OCCUP, P12; Jiong L., 2009, SPORTS CULT GUIDE, P7; Lanjia M., 2005, J BEIJING U PHYS ED, V28, P66; LeBoeuf RL, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P155, DOI 10.1177/002072091875625; Quennerstedt M, 2019, SPORT EDUC SOC, V24, P611, DOI 10.1080/13573322.2019.157473; Salehi S, 2019, PHYS REV PHYS EDUC R, V15, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.15.02011; Song X., 2009, J CHENGDU I PHYS ED, V35, P8; Tao W, 2009, J HENAN ED I NAT SCI, V18, P8; Wanlin X, 2016, J XIAN I PHYS ED, V33, P25; Xianjun J, 2010, J ANHUI NORMAL U NAT, V33, P50; Xilin L, 2011, J WUHAN POLYTECH, V10, P6; Yeshou X., 2013, J NANJING I PHYS ED, V27, P7; Zhang Y, 2018, CONT SPORTS SCI TECH, P13; Zhu Z, 2019, SPORTS, P5; Zili L, 2008, PHYS ED SCI, V29, P9",19,0,0,1,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The proposed laboratory allows students to obtain the linear model and stability condition of a robotic system, without getting involved in its mathematical modeling. The structure of a two-wheeled inverted pendulum robot has been used for demonstrating the laboratory's features. As part of this virtual experiment, design and evaluation of proportional-integral-derivative, model predictive control, and fuzzy controllers for maintaining the two-wheeled inverted pendulum's balance are considered. A set of graphical-user interfaces is designed for providing the interaction with the system. This virtual lab is readily extensible for other robotics structures and controllers, and its output data is promptly available for further analysis by other MATLAB toolboxes.","[Ghayoor, F.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Dept Elect Elect & Comp Engn, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa","Ghayoor, F (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Dept Elect Elect & Comp Engn, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa.",ghayoor@ukzn.ac.za,,"Ghayoor, Farzad/0000-0001-5780-6767",,,"[Anonymous], 2018, MOD SIM MULT PHYS S; App Compiler, 2018, BUILD STAND APPL MA; App Designer, 2018, CREAT DESKT WEB APP; Brito JJ, 2018, IEEE GLOB ENG EDUC C, P555, DOI 10.1109/EDUCON.2018.836327; Demirtas M, 2008, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON OPTIMIZATION OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT, VOL IV, P149, DOI 10.1109/OPTIM.2008.460251; Gil A, 2015, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC, V23, P443, DOI 10.1002/cae.2161; Gil A, 2014, IEEE T EDUC, V57, P92, DOI 10.1109/TE.2013.227695; Hasirci U, 2015, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V52, P320, DOI 10.1177/002072091558579; Hovland G, 2008, IEEE T EDUC, V51, P114, DOI 10.1109/TE.2007.90661; Isdaryani Feni, 2015, 2015 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronics, Intelligent Manufacture and Industrial Automation (ICAMIMIA).

However, because their own characteristics, the strategic plans in colleges and universities are mostly developed at an institutional level. As these provide an overview of the organization, they cannot be very detailed and may contain a certain amount of ambiguities in order to satisfy its multiple constituencies. At the institutional level there are limited opportunities to include specific strategies that may affect individual academic programs. To solve these limitations, this paper proposes strategic plans being developed and incorporated at the program level, specifically for electrical engineering or electrical engineering technology programs. The appropriate strategic planning results in strengthen these programs and generate useful and significant dialog among their constituencies. The paper finishes by showing a generic strategic plan for an electrical engineering technology program that can nevertheless, be adopted and modified as needed by faculty and academic staff involved in this process of creating a similar plan for their own electrical engineering programs.","[Lozano-Nieto, Albert] Penn State Univ, Wilkes Barre Campus, Lehman, PA 18612 USA","Lozano-Nieto, A (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Wilkes Barre Campus, Lehman, PA 18612 USA.",AXL17@psu.edu,,"Lozano, Albert/0000-0003-3241-012X",,,"Abdallah C, 2014, J MANAGE STUD, V51, P235, DOI 10.1111/joms.1200; ABET, CRIT ACCR ENG TECH; Allison M., 2015, STRATEGIC PLANNING ; Anderson, 1997, MANAGING STRATEGIC ; Arend RJ, 2017, STRATEGIC MANAGE J, V38, P1741, DOI 10.1002/smj.242; Bryson J.M., 2011, STRATEGIC PLANNING ; Bryson JM, 2018, PUBLIC MANAG REV, V20, P317, DOI 10.1080/14719037.2017.128511; Cardinal LB, 2001, ORGAN SCI, V12, P19, DOI 10.1287/orsc.12.1.19.1011; Crisp P., 1981, STRATEGIC PLANNING ; DeJong BP, 2014, J ENG TECHNOL, V31, P; Dooris M., 2003, PLANNING HIGHER ED, V31, P2; EADIE DC, 1983, PUBLIC ADMIN REV, V43, P447, DOI 10.2307/97585; Freedman Lawrence, 2013, STRATEGY A HIS; HOLMES J, 1985, POLITICS, V20, P2; Jennings D, 1998, DECISION MAKING INT; Keller G., 1995, MANAGEMENT REVOLUTI; KOTLER P, 1981, J HIGH EDUC, V52, P470, DOI 10.2307/198183; LANGLEY A, 1988, LONG RANGE PLANN, V21, P40, DOI 10.1016/0024-6301(88)90032-; Larsen IM, 2005, REFORM CHANGE HIGHER, P34; Namus B., 1995, VISIONARY LEADERSHI; Ruben BD, 2010, STRATEGIC PLANNING ; Salem H., 2015, GETTING MOST OUT U ; Spee AP, 2011, ORGAN STUD, V32, P1217, DOI 10.1177/017084061141138; Steiner G.A., 1979, STRATEGIC PLANNING ; Stone MM, 1996, STRATEGIC MANAGE J, V17, P633, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199610)17:8<633::AID-SMJ837>3.0.CO;2-; Taylor JS, 2008, EUR J EDUC, V43, P369, DOI 10.1111/j.1465-3435.2008.00363.",26,1,1,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

But its final closing time has been controversial. Based on the magmatic age of the surrounding orogenic belt, the source of this set of clastic sediments is determined, which provides new important evidence for the evolution of the South Tianshan orogenic belt. The results show that the Jurassic detrital zircons from the study area were mainly derived from magmatic zircons and are deposited in a proximal source. The detrital zircon age of the Lower Jurassic Badaowan and Sangonghe Formation are concentrated in 290-260 Ma, and in 350-290 Ma and 460-390 Ma, respectively. The detrital zircon age of the Middle Jurassic Xishanyao Formation concentrates in 370-320 Ma and 450-390 Ma. There are very few zircons from the Precambrian period. These ages are consistent with the timing, indicating these clastic sediments were mainly originated from the southern margin of the Yili - Middle Tianshan Block. The Late Permian - Middle Triassic detrital zircons almost do not exist, implying that there were no contemporary magmatism related to collision or post-collision in the South Tianshan district, its complex evolution and orogenic stage are still a challenging topic. In the ancient active plate margin, the sedimentary records in the pre-arc basin can provide more information about the magmatic arc and basin-orogen coupling than the present exposed arc itself. The rhyolite, trachyte, and trachyandesite of the Dahalajunshan Formation were widely developed in the Yili - Middle Tianshan Block during the Early Carboniferous. During the formation of Wulang Formation in the Early Permian, a large number of rhyolite were developed. The age data of 75 detrital zircons were obtained from the sandstone (J1s-5) of the Sangonghe Formation, of which 74 zircons have a concordance degree of over 90%, and their age data also fall on the harmonic curv. In addition, the age of the youngest zircons increased gradually from Early to Middle Jurassic, indicating that the sediments in this period had the feature of uncovering. Our study provides a good reference for the analysis of provenance and regional tectonic evolution.","[Wang, Chao; Shi, Xin] Chengdu Univ Technol, Inst Sedimentary Geol, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chao; Shi, Xin] Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservior Geol & Exploita, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chao] Sinopec Hua Bei Oilfield Serv Corp, Nanyang, Henan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Wenjian; Zhang, Huaisheng] East China Univ Technol, State Key Lab Nucl Resources & Environm, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","Jiang, WJ (corresponding author), East China Univ Technol, State Key Lab Nucl Resources & Environm, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",jiang2017@ecit.cn,,,State Key Laboratory of Nuclear Resources and Environment (East China University of Technology) [NRE 1804],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the Open Fund(NRE 1804) of State Key Laboratory of Nuclear Resources and Environment (East China University of Technology).","An F, 2017, GONDWANA RES, V43, P41, DOI 10.1016/j.gr.2015.11.01; [白建科 Bai Jianke], 2015, [地质论评, Geological Review], V61, P19; Bhattacharya JP, 2016, EARTH-SCI REV, V153, P77, DOI 10.1016/j.earscirev.2015.10.01; Charvet J, 2011, SCI CHINA EARTH SCI, V54, P166, DOI 10.1007/s11430-010-4138-; Dickinson WR, 2000, GEOL S AM S, P15; Forcan M, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P14, DOI 10.1177/002072091775095; Gao J, 2009, INT J EARTH SCI, V98, P1221, DOI 10.1007/s00531-008-0370-; Ge RF, 2014, TECTONICS, V33, P302, DOI 10.1002/2013TC00350; Ge RF, 2012, LITHOS, V142, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.lithos.2012.02.01; Gluskin E, 1996, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V33, P195, DOI 10.1177/00207209960330030; Gou LL, 2016, J ASIAN EARTH SCI, V115, P40, DOI 10.1016/j.jseaes.2015.09.02; Gu CC, 2018, GONDWANA RES, V60, P194, DOI 10.1016/j.gr.2018.04.01; Han BF, 2011, EARTH-SCI REV, V109, P74, DOI 10.1016/j.earscirev.2011.09.00; Han BF, 2010, GEOL SOC AM BULL, V122, P627, DOI 10.1130/B26491.; Han XZ, 2008, ACTA PETROL SIN, V24, P244; Han YG, 2018, EARTH-SCI REV, V186, P129, DOI 10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.09.01; Han YG, 2016, LITHOS, V246, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.lithos.2015.12.01; He ZY, 2018, EARTH-SCI REV, V185, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.05.01; [侯明才 Hou Mingcai], 2016, [地质学报, Acta Geologica Sinica], V90, P333; Huang H, 2015, LITHOS, V228, P23, DOI 10.1016/j.lithos.2015.04.01; Huang H, 2018, GEOL SOC AM BULL, V130, P952, DOI 10.1130/B31588.; IPSON SS, 1991, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V28, P322, DOI 10.1177/00207209910280040; Jiang CY, 1993, ACTA PETROLOGICA MIN, V12, P22; Jiang T, 2014, TECTONOPHYSICS, V612, P106, DOI 10.1016/j.tecto.2013.11.03; Jiang W., 2018, J E CHINA U SCI TECH, V41, P30; Kroner A, 2013, GONDWANA RES, V23, P272, DOI 10.1016/j.gr.2012.05.00; Li D, 2015, J ASIAN EARTH SCI, V113, P728, DOI 10.1016/j.jseaes.2015.09.00; [李鸿 Li Hong], 2011, [新疆地质, Xinjiang Geology], V29, P38; [李继磊 LI Ji-lei], 2009, [地质通报, Geological Bulletin of China], V28, P185; Liu DD, 2014, INT J EARTH SCI, V103, P737, DOI 10.1007/s00531-013-0994-; Liu YS, 2010, J PETROL, V51, P537, DOI 10.1093/petrology/egp08; Long LL, 2006, ACTA PETROL SIN, V22, P6; [马中平 MA Zhongping], 2007, [西北大学学报. 自然科学版, Journal of Northwest University.

In the field of design, designers use the convenience, quickness, transparency and brilliance of watercolor to draw a design drawing. In the field of art creation, watercolor is usually the best choice for painters to go out to sketch and create large-scale drawings. In the field of art education, watercolor tools are easy to carry, low-cost and easy to operate, which can facilitate students' repeated practice and outside Sketching is helpful to cultivate students' sense of color and observation ability. Therefore, as a branch of art curriculum, watercolor light color has a wide range of uses and great practicability, which is worth exploring and studying.","[Shi, Yin] Maanshan Normal Coll, Dept Educ & Teachers, Maanshan 243000, Peoples R China","Shi, Y (corresponding author), Maanshan Normal Coll, Dept Educ & Teachers, Maanshan 243000, Peoples R China.",2250833904@qq.com,,,quality engineering school enterprise cooperation practical education base project in Anhui Province: practice education base of Ma'anshan teachers college teacher art culture and art company [2016sjjd072],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: 2016 quality engineering school enterprise cooperation practical education base project in Anhui Province: practice education base of Ma'anshan teachers college teacher art culture and art company, Project No.: 2016sjjd072.","Aimin Wang, 2010, 2010 International Conference on E-Health Networking, Digital Ecosystems and Technologies (EDT 2010), P506, DOI 10.1109/EDT.2010.549644; Bongiorno L., 2014, TEACHING YOUNG CHILD, V7, P12; DAVIS JW, 1984, LEONARDO, V17, P66, DOI 10.2307/157489; Hu Y, 2011, J HIGHER ED RES, V2, P3; LeBoeuf RL, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P155, DOI 10.1177/002072091875625; Oncel AF, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P208, DOI 10.1177/002072091878871; Orji CT, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P334, DOI 10.1177/002072091877398; Perotoni MB, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P193, DOI 10.1177/002072091879009; Reid J, 2017, TOBACCO USE CANADA ; Schultz L., 2014, SCH ARTS, V84, P1; Tomohiro S, 2009, CISIS: 2009 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPLEX, INTELLIGENT AND SOFTWARE INTENSIVE SYSTEMS, VOLS 1 AND 2, P1024, DOI 10.1109/CISIS.2009.10; Wu J., 2011, J HIGHER ED RES, V21, P2",12,0,0,5,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

To obtain the types of failure, a novel fault diagnosis method based on back propagation (BP) neural network with Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) algorithm for PV modules is proposed. Through the in-depth analysis the output of PV modules under normal and fault conditions, the input variables of the diagnosis model are acquired. The high-speed and real-time fault diagnosis model for PV modules is first designed based on TMS320VC5402 DSP and long-distance wireless fault diagnosis is realized by Zigbee technology. The simulation and experimental results show that the fault diagnosis method for PV modules based on BP network with L-M algorithm can effectively detect four types of fault for PV modules such as open circuit, short circuit, partial shading and abnormal degradation. The numerical results verify the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method, which can provide a great educational benefit of PV operation technology.","[Chen, Ling; Cao, Xiang] Huaiyin Normal Univ, Sch Phys & Elect Elect Engn, Huaian, Peoples R China; [Han, Wei; Li, Hai-Tao; Xu, Zi-Kun] State Grid Jiangsu Elect Power Co Ltd, Huaian 223001, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jing-Wei] Hohai Univ, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Changzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Han, W (corresponding author), State Grid Jiangsu Elect Power Co Ltd, Huaian 223001, Peoples R China.",carolcl1987@126.com,,,Natural Science Research Program of Huai'an City [HAB201831],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors acknowledge the Natural Science Research Program of Huai'an City (Grant: HAB201831).","Appiah AY, 2019, IEEE ACCESS, V7, P30089, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.290294; Belaout A, 2018, RENEW ENERG, V127, P548, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2018.05.00; Blaifi S, 2018, ELECTR ENG, V100, P1021, DOI 10.1007/s00202-017-0567-; Chen LA, 2018, IEEE T SMART GRID, V9, P1835, DOI 10.1109/TSG.2016.260108; Dhimish M, 2017, ENERGY, V140, P276, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2017.08.10; Dhimish M, 2017, HIGH VOLT, V2, P244, DOI 10.1049/hve.2017.004; Harrou F, 2018, RENEW ENERG, V116, P22, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2017.09.04; Huang JM, 2019, IEEE ACCESS, V7, P70919, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.291933; Kamath HG, 2019, IEEE J PHOTOVOLT, V9, P424, DOI 10.1109/JPHOTOV.2018.288362; Kumar BP, 2018, IEEE J PHOTOVOLT, V8, P257, DOI 10.1109/JPHOTOV.2017.277015; Madeti SR, 2017, SOL ENERGY, V158, P161, DOI 10.1016/j.solener.2017.08.06; Mansouri M, 2018, ENERGY, V159, P842, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2018.06.19; Martin C, 2020, ENERG CONVERS MANAGE, V210, P11271; Mellit A, 2018, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V91, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2018.03.06; Triki-Lahiani A, 2018, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V82, P2680, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2017.09.10; Zarkovic MD, 2015, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V52, P81, DOI 10.1177/002072091557054; Zhang C, 2008, NEUROCOMPUTING, V72, P513, DOI 10.1016/j.neucom.2007.12.00; Zhang KF, 2016, ARAB J SCI ENG, V41, P3451, DOI 10.1007/s13369-015-2001-; Zhang WB, 2019, IEEE ACCESS, V7, P11736, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.289272; Zhao ZZ, 2016, NEURAL COMPUT APPL, V27, P375, DOI 10.1007/s00521-015-1850-; Zhu HL, 2018, SOL ENERGY, V176, P395, DOI 10.1016/j.solener.2018.10.05; Zimny J, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P142, DOI 10.1177/002072091775095",22,2,2,1,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

It aims at training skilled talents, which has made great contribution to the economy and industry. Generally, designing courses in high vocational education includes teaching analysis, teaching strategy, teaching practice and teaching assessment. Among the teaching steps, teaching assessment is one of the most important method to improve the quality of course teaching. However, in most high vocational education courses, traditional written exam is still the primary tools of assessments, which can not fulfill the development of high vocational education. In order to improve the quality of high vocational education, it is very urgent to design a practical and efficient system with multiple assessments. We exploit machine learning techniques to design assessment system for high vocation education. Machine learning is a very powerful tool for data analysis and it has been used for education tools in recent years. First, we improve the teaching organization for training skilled talents. Second, we propose a feature selection model based on the improved teaching organization. Third, we propose a machine learning model for teaching assessment. With the main contributions and other improvements, we design a multi-assessment system for vocational teaching based on machine learning. We implement the multi-assessment system by using Python and TensorFlow, which shows that the system can provide practical and efficient multiple assessments for vocational teaching based on training machine learning model. Compared with other assessment methods, machine learning based multi-assessment is more intelligent and automatic. Besides, it can be extended to other fields of education with slight modifications.","[Xiao, Meng] Shenzhen Polytech, Sch Management, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Yi, Haibo] Shenzhen Polytech, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China","Yi, HB (corresponding author), Shenzhen Polytech, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",haiboyi@szpt.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China [2018A030310030]; Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, China [2017GkQNCX059]; Teaching Research and Practice Project of Guangdong Province, China [GDJG2019403]; Special funds for Shenzhen Strategic Emerging Industries and Future Industrial Development [20170502142224600]; Teaching Research and Practice Project of Shenzhen Polytechnic [7019310019J]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors acknowledge Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (Grant no. 2018A030310030), Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, China (Grant no. 2017GkQNCX059), Teaching Research and Practice Project of Guangdong Province, China (Grant no.

Therefore, it is particularly important to meet the needs of special children's campus construction. However, China is relatively backward, and special education schools lack complete landscape design for special groups. Campus landscape carries many contents including education, leisure, communication and rehabilitation. At present, the landscape design of special education schools lacks the recognition of the particularity of special children, and ignores their demands for normal communication and interaction. Starting from the characteristics of special children, this paper analyses and studies the perceptual characteristics of hearing impaired students and visual impaired students respectively, and applies the concept of interactive design to the landscape design of special schools. Interaction design pays attention to the process of human experience, which coincides with the design idea of people-oriented emphasized in landscape design. Landscape interaction design is the design of human communication, communication and interaction space, so as to guide the campus landscape environment suitable for the barrier-free interaction of actors, make up for defects, provide safe activities, individualized education and living campus.","[Xin, Bian] Shandong Womens Univ, Inst Art & Design, Jinan 250300, Peoples R China","Xin, B (corresponding author), Shandong Womens Univ, Inst Art & Design, Jinan 250300, Peoples R China.",29065@sdwu.edu.cn,,,,,"Chen BQ., 2012, CHINA SCI ED INNOV G, V8, P1; Gang S., 2013, DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY L, V1, P8; Jiang XN., 2012, SOCIAL WELFARE THEOR, V9, P3; Kang R, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P179, DOI 10.1177/002072091879558; Loosvelt H, 2007, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V44, P146, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.44.2.; Loreto-Gomez G, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P163, DOI 10.1177/002072091879011; Muderrisoglu H, 2013, INDOOR BUILT ENVIRON, V24, P34; Wang FR., 2003, SICHUAN ARCHITECT SC, V29, P9; Zhang Y and, 2013, HUAZHONG ARCHITECT, V1, P6; Zhang YZ, 2016, J ARCHITECT, V3, P10",10,0,0,10,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

However, there are still some problems in the technological innovation network of major engineering projects, such as unclear responsibilities and rights among innovation subjects, and poor information communication, which make the technological innovation network of major engineering projects present low safety. The technological innovation network of major engineering projects is an alliance, and the dual governance consisting of formal contract governance and relational contract governance is an effective way to solve the alliance problem. Due to the transaction cost theory and relationship contract theory, identify the influencing factors of dual governance on the vulnerability of technological innovation network of major engineering projects through literature analysis. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the fragility of dual governance to the technological innovation network of major engineering projects. First, according to the transaction cost theory and relationship contract theory, the paper identifies the influencing factors of dual governance on the vulnerability of technological innovation network of major engineering projects. Then, using the complex network theory, a network model of influencing factors of technological innovation network vulnerability for major engineering projects is constructed, and MATLAB is used to simulate and analyze its vulnerability. The results are compared with the relevant network topology parameters, and finally the recommendations for reducing vulnerability are proposed. The findings provide a certain reference value for management and decision-making in the process of technological innovation of major engineering projects.","[Guo, Bin] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Publ Adm, Xian, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Zijing; Feng, Tao] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Management, Xian, Peoples R China","Cheng, ZJ (corresponding author), Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Xian 710055, Peoples R China.",chengzijing0729@126.com,,,,,"Beiza J, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P124, DOI 10.1177/002072091878873; Bossink BAG, 2004, J CONSTR ENG M, V130, P337, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2004)130:3(337; Cao Z, 2015, J OPER MANAG, V33-34, P15, DOI 10.1016/j.jom.2014.09.00; Chan APC, 2004, J CONSTR ENG M, V130, P188, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2004)130:2(188; Cheng EWL, 2000, J MANAGE ENG, V16, P84, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2000)16:2(84; Foss NJ, 2007, ORGANIZATION, V14, P29, DOI 10.1177/135050840707185; Guibing G, 2018, COMPUT INTEGR MANUF, V24, P228; Hongtao X., 2013, TECHNOL EC, V32, P2; Hongtao X, 2010, FORUM SCI TECHNOL CH, V6, P2; Jianchang L, 2015, SCI TECHNOL PROG POL, V32, P11; Jiasen R, 2015, CHIN J MANAG, V12, P45; Lei Z, 2016, SCI TECHNOL PROG POL, V33, P; Liu H, 2014, FRONT ENG MANAG, V1, P202, DOI 10.15302/J-FEM-201402; Liu H, 2016, J CIV ENG MANAG, V22, P401, DOI 10.3846/13923730.2014.97573; Manley K, 2017, J MANAGE ENG, V33, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.000054; Mengjun W, 2011, STRATEGIC STUDY CAE, V13, P6; Mengjun W, 2012, STRATEGIC STUDY CAE, V14, P10; Mengjun W, 2016, J CHINA RAILWAY SOC, V38, P14; Naqvi SR, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P140, DOI 10.1177/002072091879010; Ozorhon B, 2013, J MANAGE ENG, V29, P455, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.000015; Papadonikolaki E, 2018, J MANAGE ENG, V34, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.000064; Skibniewski MJ, 2013, J CIV ENG MANAG, V19, P136, DOI 10.3846/13923730.2012.75606; Wan D, 2005, TECHNOVATION, V25, P261, DOI 10.1016/S0166-4972(03)00096-; Wei Tong Chen, 2007, International Journal of Project Management, V25, P475, DOI 10.1016/j.ijproman.2006.12.00; Xue XL, 2018, J CLEAN PROD, V173, P265, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.01.00; Yang Y., 2014, SCI TECHNOLOGY PROGR, V31, P1; Yongfu S, 2012, J CHINA RAILWAY SOC, V34, P7; Zhen Z., 2016, SCI TECHNOL PROG POL, V33, P10; Zhensen Z, 2012, SCI TECHNOL PROG POL, V29, P3; Zhensen Z, 2013, MODERNIZATION MANAG, V2, P2; Zhensen Z, 2012, J ADV INFORM SCI SER, V22, P39",31,0,0,13,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Unlike the previous studies presented in the literature, the proposed method takes into account the excitation voltage limit and therefore formulates a new objective function for optimal PID parameters design. The practical aspect of the proposed constraint is significant since the generator field winding can be seriously damaged in case of the large excitation voltage. The performance of the proposed controller using the solution methodology proposed in this study and its contribution to the robustness of the control system are investigated. Further, the obtained PID parameters are used to simulate the AVR dynamics for a large step change in the generator's voltage set-point. Besides, the obtained step responses have been compared with the corresponding responses of the AVR system whose PID parameters are determined by using well-known methods presented in the literature. Also, the proposed AEO-PID controller shows superior performances in the case of uncertainties in the AVR system's parameters, as well as in the presence of the different disturbances in the system. The results obtained show that the obtained parameters provided a more secure and stable machine operation even with changes of the reference, generator, or excitation voltage signals compared with the performance of the controllers obtained by the previous works presented in the literature. Furthermore, AEO has proven its ability to get optimal solutions in a fast and efficient manner in terms of accuracy and time spent per iteration.","[Calasan, Martin; Micev, Mihailo] Univ Montenegro, Fac Elect Engn, Podgorica 81000, Montenegro; [Djurovic, Zeljko] Univ Belgrade, Sch Elect Engn, Belgrade, Serbia; [Mageed, Hala M.

However, with the rapid development of financial industry, the income of urban and rural residents is increasingly unbalanced. The increasing income gap between urban and rural areas has caused a large number of adverse phenomena in the process of economic development, seriously affecting the income distribution of the people and even causing social instability. Therefore, in today's big data era, it is necessary to systematically study and analyze the impact of financial industry development on the national income gap between urban and rural areas. At the same time, it is of great significance to improve the problem of excessive income gap between urban and rural areas. This paper mainly analyses the relationship between the three effects of the development of financial industry and the income gap between urban and rural residents. In the empirical aspect, the paper creatively uses the fuzzy Kmeans clustering algorithm to regression analysis the panel data of a certain area from 2010 to 2018. At the same time, in the empirical data analysis, this paper creatively replaces the European norm measure of the Kmeans clustering algorithm with the AE measure, and puts forward a proposal. The index of financial development level is based on the proportion of loans from financial institutions. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, this paper draws the following conclusions: the financial scale in the financial industry will have a huge impact on the income gap between urban and rural areas. Finally, based on the above problems and current situation, this paper puts forward relevant improvement suggestions.","[Li, Yao] Haikou Univ Econ, Sch Business Adm, Haikou 571127, Hainan, Peoples R China","Li, Y (corresponding author), Haikou Univ Econ, Sch Business Adm, Haikou 571127, Hainan, Peoples R China.",liyao1005@163.com,,,special project of philosophy and social sciences of Hainan Province: Research on Optimization and Adjustment of Industrial Structure in Hainan Province Constrained by Resources and Environment [HNSK(YB)19-44]; planned project of philosophy and social sciences of Hainan Province: The Innovative Research on the Evolution of Island Ecological Civilization and the Division of Green Industry Recycling Type [HNSK(ZX)18-118],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was awarded the special project of philosophy and social sciences of Hainan Province: Research on Optimization and Adjustment of Industrial Structure in Hainan Province Constrained by Resources and Environment (Grant No. HNSK(YB)19-44) and the planned project of philosophy and social sciences of Hainan Province: The Innovative Research on the Evolution of Island Ecological Civilization and the Division of Green Industry Recycling Type (Grant No. HNSK(ZX)18-118).","[Anonymous], 2017, EMPIR ECO; Demuzere M, 2017, Q J ROY METEOR SOC, V143, P1581, DOI 10.1002/qj.302; Gavankar NL, 2019, GEOCARTO INT, V34, P626, DOI 10.1080/10106049.2018.142573; Gupta R, 2017, APPL INTELL, V47, P624, DOI 10.1007/s10489-017-0917-; Haan JD, 2018, APPL EC LETT, P; Islam F, 2010, MPRA PAP, V40, P15; Ji L., 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V57, P17; Jingjing HU, 2013, FINANC TRADE EC, V34, P12; Kiran T, 2017, CANCER EPIDEM BIOMAR, V26, P1401, DOI 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-17-030; Lei GQ, 2016, CHINA FINANC ECON RE, V4, DOI 10.1186/s40589-016-0042-; Ma X, 2018, COMPUT ECON, V52, P1153, DOI 10.1007/s10614-017-9759-; Nongmeikapam K, 2018, IET IMAGE PROCESS, V12, P513, DOI 10.1049/iet-ipr.2017.110; Vincens N, 2018, SOC SCI MED, V196, P115, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.02; Wang F, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V57, P7; Wang YM, 2010, J SHANGHAI U FINANC, V30, P24; Ward JL, 2017, BMC PUBLIC HEALTH, V17, DOI 10.1186/s12889-017-4310-; Yeldan AE., 2004, RES PAP, V51, P61; Zheng LL, 2018, BMC HEALTH SERV RES, V18, DOI 10.1186/s12913-018-3522-",18,2,2,8,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This topic involves many physical and mathematical concepts like curl, divergence, gradient for field determination and representation. These concepts are not only difficult to understand but also often lead to poor learning because of the imaginations and non-visualization of electric and magnetic fields. A correct understanding of fields and its distribution is necessary to understand the working, design and optimization of electrical machines. This paper presents a finite element method (FEM) based educational tool that allows the technical students to visualize electromagnetic (EM) fields inside the EM systems. This tool therefore provides a better understanding of the design and optimization of various electrical devices. This paper shows an example of a 2-pole linear machine to visualize the distribution of the magnetic field in a non-linear circuit. This machine extends to form a linear switched reluctance motor (LSRM) using step-by-step design and optimization procedure along with the user guide interface programmed in FEM based ANSYS Maxwell software. This motor is used as an example to visualize magnetic fields using FEM software in complex circuits and can be used as a good educational tool for students.

As the harmonic content increases, higher core loss and eddy current loss in the windings results in higher operating temperatures. It causes magnetic flux density in the core to increase and shifts the operating point through the saturated region. This phenomenon is mostly taught in undergraduate education as theoretical information. However, as a difficult concept to understand, harmonics phenomenon might be taught by using experiments for active learning, visualizing the effects in a laboratory setting, and making the connection between theoretical and practical applications for deeper and meaningful learning. In this study, a teaching method for effects of harmonics is proposed and phase shift between the fundamental and harmonic component of the supply voltage on the transformer B-H characteristic in a laboratory application is introduced by an experimental work performed on toroidal transformers. Feedback from students shows that the proposed method is very efficient and useful for students to better understand the effects of harmonics on the transformer cores.","[Donuk, Atilla] Adnan Menderes Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Aydin, Turkey","Donuk, A (corresponding author), Adnan Menderes Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Aydin, Turkey.",adonuk@adu.edu.tr,,,,,"Al-Haj AH, 2000, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V15, P163, DOI 10.1109/61.84724; Amoiralis EI, 2009, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V24, P1999, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2009.202876; [Anonymous], 2008, C57110 IEEE, VC57, P11; [Anonymous], 2002, C571280 IEEE, VC57, P8; Ayasun S, 2006, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC, V14, P142, DOI 10.1002/cae.2007; BAGHZOUZ Y, 1993, IEEE T POWER SYST, V8, P746, DOI 10.1109/59.26080; Chowdhury AH, 1999, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V14, P450, DOI 10.1109/61.75408; Corona-Sanchez MA, 2017, IEEE T MAGN, V53, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2017.265682; Dayi L, 2009, INT C EL MACH SYST ; Digalovski M, 2013, EUROCO; Gorji Ghalamestani S, 2016, IEEE T MAGN, V52, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2016.251565; Hamad MS, 2012, IET POWER ELECTRON, V5, P1315, DOI 10.1049/iet-pel.2011.037; HSU JS, 1989, IEEE T MAGN, V25, P267; Huang P, 2017, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V64, P4391, DOI 10.1109/TIE.2017.267459; Jimenez-Mondragon VM, 2016, IEEE T MAGN, V52, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2016.258052; Kefalas TD, 2012, IEEE T MAGN, V48, P1609, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2011.217292; Krause TW, 2003, IEEE T MAGN, V39, P562, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2002.80635; Masoum MAS, 2008, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V23, P2033, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2008.92305; Mohammed OA, 2006, IEEE T MAGN, V42, P967, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2006.87246; Pedra J, 2004, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V19, P884, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2004.82525; Pierce LW, 1996, IEEE T IND APPL, V32, P633, DOI 10.1109/28.50217; Prochazka R, 2015, IEEE T MAGN, V51, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2014.235778; Scher AD, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P367, DOI 10.1177/002072091877504; Shameer AK, 2011, IEEE GCC C EXH UN A; Stensland T, 1997, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V12, P768, DOI 10.1109/61.58436; Steurer M, 2002, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V17, P155, DOI 10.1109/61.97420; Terciyanli A, 2010, IEEE EN CONV C EXP ; TranQuoc T, 1997, IEEE T MAGN, V33, P2045, DOI 10.1109/20.58271; Vahidi B, 2005, IEEE T EDUC, V48, P307, DOI 10.1109/TE.2004.84290; Zhang YS, 2016, IEEE T MAGN, V52, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2015.247429",30,3,3,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The authors developed and analyzed four market models, no IR enter and no brand remanufacture (n), no IR enter and brand remanufacture (nR), IR enter and no brand manufacture (nr), and IR enter and brand remanufacture (nrR). They then analyzed the results using sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis. The research found that new product prices, brand remanufactured product prices, and general re-product prices are positively correlated with brand loyalty; with the increasing level of brand loyalty, brand manufacturers' profit increases, while the IR's profit is lowered. Further, when the manufacturing costs of new products are high, the model preference for the brand manufacturers is always nR > nrR > n > nr; when the costs are lower, the level of the consumer brand loyalty affects the model preference. In models nr and nrR, brand loyalty may increase the brand consumer surplus, but reduces the average consumer surplus, total consumer surplus, and total social welfare.","[Peng, Gao; Jian-Guo, Du; Bin-Xin, Zhu] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Management, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Peng, Gao] Jiangsu Univ Technol, Sch Business, Changzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wei-Dong, Huang] Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Nanjing, Peoples R China","Wei-Dong, H (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Management, Nanjing 210003, Peoples R China.",uangwd@njupt.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71671093]; Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education; Key Research Base of Philosophy and Social Sciences; Jiangsu Province University Philosophy and Social Sciences Outstanding Innovation Team Construction Project; Special Funds of the National Social Science Fund of China [18VSJ038],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Work described in this paper was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71671093.

This paper aims to explore the psychosocial path of people participating in the collective action of NIMBY conflict, and to provide theoretical basis for effective governance of NIMBY conflict. By integrating the psychosocial explanatory variables related to collective action, we construct a regulated double mediation Model, which is empirically tested with 566 questionnaires from the NIMBY conflict in gaoling, China. The results show that: group relative deprivation, group emotions and group effectiveness have positive effects on people's NIMBY conflict participation tendency; group effectiveness and group emotions are important mediating variables of group relative deprivation affecting people's NIMBY conflict participation tendency; group identity has a positive adjustment effect on people's group emotions, group effectiveness, and the participation tendency of NIMBY conflict. The research indicates that group relative deprivation is the key precursor of NIMBY conflict, group emotion is the key factor driving the deterioration of NIMBY conflict, and group identity is the key factor catalyzing the occurrence of NIMBY conflict. This study helps to explain the psychological mechanism of people's participation in NIMBY conflict, and has certain implications for the prevention and governance of NIMBY conflict.","[Guo, Bin] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Publ Adm, Xian 710055, Peoples R China; [Li, KunJi] Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Management, Xian, Peoples R China","Li, KJ (corresponding author), Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Publ Adm, Xian 710055, Peoples R China.",376119298@qq.com,,,,,"Bandura A., 1986, J APPL PSYCHOL, V12, P169, DOI DOI 10.5465/AMR.1987.430653; Chao J, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V2, P7; Gibson CB, 2007, ACAD MANAGE REV, V32, P43; Jia LZ, 2013, J YUNNAN NORMAL U PH, V2, P7; Kakada P, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V1, P4; Kelloway EK, 2008, J APPL PSYCHOL, V93, P806, DOI 10.1037/0021-9010.93.4.80; Kelloway EK, 2007, BASIC APPL SOC PSYCH, V29, P13, DOI 10.1080/0197353070133088; Klandermans B, 2002, POLIT PSYCHOL, V23, P235, DOI 10.1111/0162-895X.0028; Liang HG, 2007, MIS QUART, V31, P5; Mackie DM, 2000, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V79, P602, DOI 10.1037//0022-3514.79.4.60; Mark M.M., 1984, REV PERSONALITY SOCI, V5, P19; Miller DA, 2009, GROUP PROCESS INTERG, V12, P445, DOI 10.1177/136843020910504; Osborne D, 2012, PERS SOC PSYCHOL B, V38, P628, DOI 10.1177/014616721143276; PARCEL TL, 1981, AM J SOCIOL, V86, P1193, DOI 10.1086/22737; Smith HJ, 2012, PERS SOC PSYCHOL REV, V16, P203, DOI 10.1177/108886831143082; van Zomeren M, 2004, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V87, P649, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.87.5.64; van Zomeren M, 2008, PSYCHOL BULL, V134, P504, DOI 10.1037/0033-2909.134.4.50; van Zomeren M, 2012, PERS SOC PSYCHOL REV, V16, P180, DOI 10.1177/108886831143083; van Zomeren M, 2009, J SOC ISSUES, V65, P645, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-4560.2009.01618.; Wang EP., 2012, LEADERSHIP SCI, V1, P; Wohl MJA, 2015, PERS SOC PSYCHOL B, V41, P714, DOI 10.1177/014616721557672; WRIGHT SC, 1990, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V58, P994, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.58.6.99",22,0,0,14,46,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

First, social network data are analyzed, which finds that the type of text data marks the majority. By using data mining technology, the raw data of numerous social network users can be obtained. Based on the random walk model, the data information of the text status of social network users is analyzed, and a user personality prediction method integrating multi-label learning is proposed. In addition, the online social network platform Weibo is taken as the research object. The blog information of Weibo users is obtained through crawler technology. Then, the users are labeled in accordance with personality characteristics. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used to evaluate the relation between the user personality characteristics and the user behavior characteristics of the Weibo users. The correlation between the network behaviors and personality characteristics of Weibo users is analyzed, and the scientificity of the prediction method is verified by the Big Five Model of Personality. By applying relevant technologies and algorithms of data mining and deep learning, the learning ability of neural networks on data characteristics can be improved. In terms of performance on analyzing text information of social network users, the user personality prediction method of integrated multi-label learning based on the random walk model has a large advantage. For the problem of personality prediction of social network users, through combining data mining technology and deep neural network technology in deep learning, the data processing results of social network user behaviors are more accurate.","[Zhu, Yu] Inner Mongolia Univ Sci & Technol, Ideol & Polit Educ, Baotou, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China","Zhu, Y (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Univ Sci & Technol, Ideol & Polit Educ, Baotou, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China.",zhuyusyx@sina.com,,,,,"Bell DC, 2017, SOC SCI RES, V62, P350, DOI 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2016.08.01; Bisen SS, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091989419; Chen TY, 2016, ONLINE INFORM REV, V40, P913, DOI 10.1108/OIR-08-2015-026; Chen X, 2016, INTERNET RES, V26, P566, DOI 10.1108/IntR-05-2014-014; Eyo M, 2016, COGENT EDUC, V3, DOI 10.1080/2331186X.2015.112813; Gong JB, 2017, SCI CHINA INFORM SCI, V60, DOI 10.1007/s11432-017-9243-; Guimaraes RG, 2017, IEEE ACCESS, V5, P10805, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.270667; Gulati A, 2017, BMC PULM MED, V17, DOI 10.1186/s12890-017-0393-; Guo LY, 2016, SOC BEHAV PERSONAL, V44, P1661, DOI 10.2224/sbp.2016.44.10.166; Hou J, 2018, FRONT PSYCHOL, V9, DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2018.0054; Huang HJ, 2018, IEEE T VEH TECHNOL, V67, P8549, DOI 10.1109/TVT.2018.285178; Kim J, 2018, ASIAN J COMMUN, V28, P93, DOI 10.1080/01292986.2017.136379; Konate Arouna, 2018, Wuhan University Journal of Natural Sciences, V23, P237, DOI 10.1007/s11859-018-1316-; Koutsoukas A, 2017, J CHEMINFORMATICS, V9, DOI 10.1186/s13321-017-0226-; Liang YJ, 2018, COMMUN NONLINEAR SCI, V57, P439, DOI 10.1016/j.cnsns.2017.10.01; Manjunatha HC, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091989106; Merchant K, 2018, IEEE J-STSP, V12, P160, DOI 10.1109/JSTSP.2018.279644; Nguyen G, 2019, ARTIF INTELL REV, V52, P77, DOI 10.1007/s10462-018-09679-; Phan N, 2016, SOC NETW ANAL MIN, V6, DOI 10.1007/s13278-016-0379-; Shire SY, 2018, AUTISM, V22, P299, DOI 10.1177/136236131667409; Souri A, 2018, HUM-CENT COMPUT INFO, V8, DOI 10.1186/s13673-018-0147-; Tadesse MM, 2018, IEEE ACCESS, V6, P61959, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2018.287650; van Geel M, 2017, PERS INDIV DIFFER, V106, P231, DOI 10.1016/j.paid.2016.10.06; Wang C., 2017, INT J CONTROL AUTOM, V15, P; Zhang WS, 2017, SOFTWARE PRACT EXPER, V47, P1127, DOI 10.1002/spe.248; Zheng Huizhong, 2016, Journal of Jilin University (Science Edition), V54, P561, DOI 10.13413/j.cnki.jdxblxb.2016.03.2",26,3,3,6,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This method incorporates both the locality of spatial and the correlation across spectrum of multispectral image. Remote sensing image is divided into different groups by clustering, and sparse representation coefficients of spatial and spectral and dictionary is obtained according to the dictionary learning algorithm. After threshold processing, the similar blocks are averaged and realized with multispectral remote sensing image denoising.

Real-time smoke detection via machine-based identification method in the area of surveillance system has been of great advantage in recent era. An effective smoke detection strategy is necessary to avoid the hazard resulting from fire. The conventional smoke detection method lacks in accuracy, therefore, deep learning based smoke detection is adopted for the same purpose. However, a lot of video smoke detection approach involves minimum lighting and it can be required for the cameras to discover the existence of smoke particles in a scene. Eliminating such challenges, our proposed work introduces a novel concept like hybrid reinforcement deep Q learning classifier of smoke detection. This work takes the correct decision about the smoke particles via reinforcement deep Q learning and classifies the smoke particle with the deep convolutional neural network. The proposed real-time algorithm is aimed to provide proper education for the engineers to detect moving objects for the purpose of developing surveillance systems. This method is also helpful for the beginners who have keen interest in the field of deep learning to control fire. Here, to observe the temporal variance of fire smoke, spatial analysis is identified in the present frame and in the subsequence of the video, spatio-temporal analysis has been taken into account. Finally, smoke particles are classified with the novel reinforcement Q learning-based classifier and experimental results show a better performance regarding classification accuracy. So we can detect smoke successfully with the novel method.

Designed for Distance Vocational Training and Education, this system uses the LabVIEW Virtual Instrumentation Program to control lighting levels. In this program, the interface developed allows students to control and monitor applications online using cameras, sensors, and controllers. In the modeled system, the lighting levels of LED lamps are controlled through PID controllers. Furthermore, a web page was designed that provides synchronized (simultaneous) access to application instrumentation for the students. Each user can run applications in a specific period through this website. Students can also monitor the lighting level of the laboratory in real-time with a webcam. Individual storage of the data obtained in the model also supports conducting necessary analyses. Students can strengthen their theoretical knowledge by running lighting technique experiment applications with real equipment in the Distance Vocational Training and Education. In the evaluation part of the research, the answers are given by the students (95%) also stated that they increased the theoretical knowledge of doing remote experiments. In total 98.5% of students believe that the ability to repeat experiments anywhere in this system will accelerate the learning process.","[Polat, Zuhal] Marmara Univ, Vocat Sch Tech Sci, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ekren, Nazmi] Marmara Univ, Fac Technol, Istanbul, Turkey","Polat, Z (corresponding author), Marmara Univ, Vocat Sch Tech Sci, Istanbul, Turkey.",zuhalpolat@marmara.udu.tr,,,Marmara University Scientific Research Projects Commission (BAPKO) [FEN-C-DRP 91212-0360],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by Marmara University Scientific Research Projects Commission (BAPKO) (Project No: FEN-C-DRP 91212-0360).","Andrei H, 2009, POWERTECH 200; [Anonymous], 2014, LABVIEW ILE PROGRAM; ASTROM KJ, 1993, IFAC SYMP SERIES, V1993, P37; Ayca AK, 2018, EURASIA J MATH SCI T, V14, P2493, DOI [10.29333/ejmste/89947, DOI 10.29333/EJMSTE/89947; El-Hajjar M, 2012, INTRO LABVIE; Engin AO, 2010, J KAFKAS U I SOCIAL, V1, P6; Gamble J., 2013, REVISITING GLOBAL TR, V20; Garcia-Orellana CJ, 2016, TECHNOLOGIES APPL E; Gautam Vaibhav, 2015, International Journal of Modern Education and Computer Science, V7, P12, DOI 10.5815/ijmecs.2015.04.0; George D., 2003, USING SPSS WINDOWS ; Gullu A, 2015, PROCD SOC BEHV, V176, P1050, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.01.57; Hamed Basil, 2012, INT J SOFT COMPUTING, VI, P9; Haritman E, 2018, IOP C SERIES MAT SC; Hu WS, 2013, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V60, P4673, DOI 10.1109/TIE.2012.220844; ISMAN A, 2001, SAKARYA U EGITIM FAK, V2, P; Jin ML, 2009, J MAR SCI TECH-TAIW, V17, P11; Kaya Z, 2014, TURK ONLINE J DISTAN, V15, P206, DOI 10.17718/tojde.3039; Liu YH, 2018, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC, V26, P1493, DOI 10.1002/cae.2205; Maire G, 2014, EVALUATION IMPLEMEN; Meng L, 2012, J DALIAN POLYTECH U, V31, P7; Mondal S, 2014, 14 INT C ENV EL EN; Odabasi F., 1998, COMPUTER ASSISTED E; Odema M, 2019, 2019 INT C INN TREN; Popovic B, 2013, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC, V21, pE110, DOI 10.1002/cae.2053; Qiu XJ, 2015, PROCEDIA ENGINEER, V99, P981, DOI 10.1016/j.proeng.2014.12.63; Saravanan R., 2012, IAES INT J ARTIF INT, V1, P7; Singh A, 2015, IJEEE, V; Singh AK, 2014, IJEEE, V3, P29; Song J, 2011, APPL SCI TECHNOL, V12, P1; Spayde DL, 2019, ASEE SE SECT ; Tekin A, 2012, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC, V20, P702, DOI 10.1002/cae.2044; Wan H, 2019, P 2019 GREAT LAK S ; Yabanova I, 2016, J ENG TECHNOL, V33, P3; Yu L, 2012, MOD ARCHIT ELECT, V8, P2",34,5,5,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Performance of the power system comprising of conventional sources like hydro and thermal generating units is evaluated by cascaded fuzzy PD-PI controller optimised by grasshopper optimization algorithm. The potential of grasshopper optimization algorithm is validated by comparing with other algorithms. Further, load-frequency response is studied by penetrating solar-thermal and wind power generating units into the recommended system. The power system integrated with renewable sources puts forth a great stability challenge in the wake of high load perturbation. Hence, a robust secondary controller named cascaded fuzzy PD-PI controller is designed by endorsing a profound grasshopper optimization algorithm technique, to tackle this stability challenge. The credibility of the cascaded fuzzy PD-PI controller with/without nonlinearities presented in the system is validated by comparing the results obtained from proportional-integral-derivative and fuzzy-proportional-integral-derivative controllers. Besides this, the performance of the system under highly perturbed step load variation confers the robustness of the proposed method.","[Tripathy, Debasis; Choudhury, N. B.

As a possible energy option, on-grid infrastructure is selected looking at its low necessity of development and hardware cost. This paper aims to impart the detailed designs of alternative energy options that will offset the annual irrigation costs of the Rainbow Youth Golf Education Program in Klamath County. Using simulator, a practical modeling of the system is performed to look at the cost associated with each case. After selecting a combination with the minimum cost, it is shown that the model decreases the irrigation cost compared to previous year. Other technological implications are also evaluated. Finally, worst case scenario is modeled using the simulator to show that even in the bad weather, the site's energy supply model serves well both electrically and economically.","[Hossain, Eklas; Shi, Feng] Oregon Tech, Dept Elect Engn & Renewable Energy, Oregon Renewable Energy Ctr OREC, Klamath Falls, OR USA; [Bayindir, Ramazan] Gazi Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Fac Technol, Ankara, Turkey; [Hossain, Jakir] Khulna Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Khulna, Bangladesh","Hossain, E (corresponding author), Oregon Inst Technol, 3201 Campus Dr, Klamath Falls, OR 97601 USA.",eklas.hossain@oit.edu,"Hossain, Jakir/ABA-1120-2020; Bayindir, Ramazan/A-4595-2018","Hossain, Jakir/0000-0002-6870-9142; Bayindir, Ramazan/0000-0001-6424-0343",,,"Banos R, 2011, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V15, P1753, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2010.12.00; Evans A, 2009, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V13, P1082, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2008.03.00; Frankovic D, 2017, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V54, P189, DOI 10.1177/002072091667364; Hepbasli A, 2008, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V12, P593, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2006.10.00; Hessami MA, 2011, APPL ENERG, V88, P2755, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.12.01; Hossain E., 2016, THESI; Hossain E, 2017, INT J RENEW ENERGY R, V7, P44; Hossain E, 2014, INT J RENEW ENERGY R, V4, P109; Hossain E, 2014, ENERG CONVERS MANAGE, V86, P132, DOI 10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.01; Kabalci E, 2014, INT CONF RENEW ENERG, P880, DOI 10.1109/ICRERA.2014.701651; Katti PK, 2007, RENEW ENERG, V32, P1346, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2006.06.00; Khan MJ, 2005, RENEW ENERG, V30, P835, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2004.09.00; Lee AHI, 2009, RENEW ENERG, V34, P120, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2008.04.01; Lund H, 2007, ENERGY, V32, P912, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2006.10.01; Mahmood ASMA, 2008, 2008 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: ICCIT 2008, VOLS 1 AND 2, P72; Mann K., 2003, EC RENEWABLE HYDROGE, P1; Nema P, 2007, INT C ADV EN SYST IC, P35; Nema P, 2009, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V13, P2096, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2008.10.00; Norian KH, 2014, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V51, P100, DOI [10.7227/IJEEE.51.22, 10.7227/IJEEE.51.2.2; Paatero JV, 2005, WIND ENERGY, V8, P421, DOI 10.1002/we.15; Pinaud BA, 2013, ENERG ENVIRON SCI, V6, P1983, DOI 10.1039/c3ee40831; Sakib N, 2017, INT J RENEW ENERGY R, V7, P39; Varun, 2009, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V13, P2716, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2009.05.00",23,1,1,1,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This issue complicates the process of supply and demand balancing because the electrical energy generated by photovoltaic arrays cannot be directly stored. Energy storage systems provide a solution to this issue by storing the excess energy generated during peak generation time which will be delivered to the grid during peak load, increasing system energy efficiency. In this work, the possibility of utilizing a Megawatt scale energy storage system, such as a battery bank, to improve the efficiency of a proposed 10-MW Biglow Canyon solar array through solar peak shaving is discussed in detail. With an overview of the benefits of peak shaving and a comparative study of energy storage technologies, an assessment of the most suitable commercially available storage systems is broadly discussed in the paper. Three control algorithms based on battery storage, state of charge, and constant output are proposed to balance the difference between generation and usage using appropriate energy storage system.

Wind certainly emerges as one of the most plausible energy sources in modern power generation. However, large-scale wind energy is associated with fluctuations in voltage and power due to its intermittent nature. The proposed pumped hydroelectric energy storage system offers one of the best solutions in solving this problem. It is shown that large-scale integration of wind energy becomes more feasible and efficient when a proper energy storage system is added to achieve appropriate energy charging or discharging. Upon comparing the potential of different storage systems, pumped hydroelectric energy storage is found to be highly promising for wind integration. In order to demonstrate the behavior of the integrated system with respect to time constant and to verify the feasibility of the energy storage in different case studies, simulations are performed in Matlab/Simulink. This work would open new doors toward the investigation of large-scale wind power integration. It is also expected that pumped hydroelectric energy storage would become a possible alternative for energy reserves for large-scale wind power applications.","[Carew, Nick; Warnock, William; Hossain, Eklas] Oregon Renewable Energy Ctr OREC, Dept Elect Engn & Renewable Energy, Klamath Falls, OR USA; [Bayindir, Ramazan] Gazi Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Ankara, Turkey; [Rakin, Adnan Siraj] Bangladesh Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Dhaka, Bangladesh","Hossain, E (corresponding author), Oregon Inst Technol, 3201 Campus Dr, Klamath Falls, OR 97601 USA.",eklas.hossain@oit.edu,"; Bayindir, Ramazan/A-4595-2018","rakin, Adnan Siraj/0000-0001-5444-8394; Bayindir, Ramazan/0000-0001-6424-0343",,,"Akhil A.

However, when the energy is exchanged between AC side and DC side or vice versa, the fluctuation in the capacitor used in deputize unit is unavoidable. The fluctuation in the deputize unit is due to the increase in the total harmonic distortion by the capacitor in the output voltages. This total harmonic distortion is evaded by exploring the deputize unit capacitor voltage mathematically. This paper proposes the enhanced frequency shift carrier modulation in H-bridge multilevel converter to suppress the influence of fluctuation in deputize unit capacitor voltages. Enhanced frequency shift carrier modulation is considered for nonlinear compensation. The principal results of using this enhanced frequency shift carrier modulation improvise the total harmonic distortion in the output voltage of H-bridge multilevel converter. Simulation and experimental results are done using MATLAB/SIMULINK to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","[Yuvaraja, T.; Kumar, K. A.

The large population is affected by diabetic retinopathy and hence research in the area of automated screening has acquired major research interest in the scientific community. The diagnosing features for diabetic retinopathy comprises of identifying deformations of minute blood vessel in form of exudates and its features occurring in and around the regions of fundus which will result into exudes, hemorrhages, or microaneurysms. This feature is often hard to be classified by naked eyes and need trained personnel for close inspection before making diagnosis. Therefore, a comprehensive machine learning tool is in the demand for automated diabetic retinopathy detection. Neural networks have given promising results in the field of classification. Therefore, we present a hybrid neural network-based method with realistic clinical potential. In this study, we present a neuro-fuzzy technique, which is developed for identification of exudates in retinal images and is utilized for the extraction of essential features from the retinal images of patient's eyeballs. We trained this hybrid neural network base technique over a set of 25,600 training images for color retinal images and tested it over 12,000 testing image set for binocular model. The method achieves an accuracy of 95.4% recognition on non-noisy images and 93% on noisy images; thereby giving a consistency rate of 91% in correspondence with the ophthalmologist.","[Jeyapriya, J.; Umadevi, K.

The prototypes of analog and digital fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers are built in the laboratory. These fractional-order PID controllers are applied to linear and nonlinear plants to demonstrate the effectiveness of fractional-order calculus in real time. These experiments are designed, developed, and implemented on the analog and digital platforms. These controllers are integrated to control the DC motor, brushless DC motor, and magnetic levitation modules through hardware-in-loop as well as stand-alone systems. The analog type of fractional-order PID implementation is carried out by using passive components (i.e. resistances and capacitances) with an operational amplifier. However, real-time digital implementation is carried out using field-programmable gate array and digital signal processor. This paper describes how the experiments on fractional calculus can be tailored for graduate, undergraduate students' education and extended for research in this emerging area.","[Khubalkar, Swapnil; Junghare, Anjali; Aware, Mohan] VNIT, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India; [Das, Shantanu] Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India","Khubalkar, S (corresponding author), VNIT, Elect Engn Dept, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India.",swapnilkhubalkar@students.vnit.ac.in,"Aware, Mohan/AAK-8513-2020; Khubalkar, Swapnil W/D-9302-2019; Khubalkar, Swapnil/I-7365-2015","Khubalkar, Swapnil W/0000-0002-7845-3355; Khubalkar, Swapnil/0000-0002-7845-3355",Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences [2012/36/69],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences, project sanction no. 2012/36/69.","Adhikary A., 2017, INA LETT, V2, P41, DOI [10.1007/s41403-017-0020-1, DOI 10.1007/S41403-017-0020-1; Adhikary A, 2016, IEEE T CIRCUITS-I, V63, P1142, DOI 10.1109/TCSI.2016.256826; Alsaedi A, 2015, ADV MECH ENG, V7, DOI 10.1177/168781401561812; Anand S, 2012, IEEE T EDUC, V55, P573, DOI 10.1109/TE.2012.220068; [Anonymous], FUNCTIONAL FRACTIONAL CALCULUS, SECOND EDITIO; Aware MV, 2017, ANALOG INTEGR CIRC S, V91, P131, DOI 10.1007/s10470-016-0920-; Biswas K, 2006, IEEE T CIRCUITS-II, V53, P802, DOI 10.1109/TCSII.2006.87910; Calderon AJ, 2006, SIGNAL PROCESS, V86, P2803, DOI 10.1016/j.sigpro.2006.02.02; Chen X, 2017, IEEE T POWER ELECTR, V32, P7034, DOI 10.1109/TPEL.2016.262878; Chopade AS, 2018, IEEE-CAA J AUTOMATIC, V5, P977, DOI 10.1109/JAS.2016.751018; Chopade AS, 2016, 2016 IEEE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL, MEASUREMENT AND INSTRUMENTATION (CMI), P331, DOI 10.1109/CMI.2016.741376; Debnath L., 2003, INT J MATH MATH SCI, V54, P3413, DOI [10.1155/S0161171203301486, DOI 10.1155/S0161171203301486; Dhabale AS, 2015, ASIAN J CONTROL, V17, P2143, DOI 10.1002/asjc.114; Dimeas I, 2017, AEU-INT J ELECTRON C, V78, P192, DOI 10.1016/j.aeue.2017.03.01; Dwivedi P, 2017, J FRANKLIN I, V354, P7732, DOI 10.1016/j.jfranklin.2017.09.01; Elwakil AS, 2010, IEEE CIRC SYST MAG, V10, P40, DOI 10.1109/MCAS.2010.93863; Estakhrouiyeh MR, 2017, T I MEAS CONTROL, V40, P177; Freeborn TJ, 2015, MATER RENEW SUSTAIN, V4, DOI 10.1007/s40243-015-0052-; Jiang CX, 2007, ADVANCES IN FRACTIONAL CALCULUS, P333, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4020-6042-7_2; Johansson H, 2013, IEEE J EM SEL TOP C, V3, P404, DOI 10.1109/JETCAS.2013.227385; Khanra M, 2013, J FRANKLIN I, V350, P1753, DOI 10.1016/j.jfranklin.2013.05.00; Khubalkar SW, 2016, 2016 IEEE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL, MEASUREMENT AND INSTRUMENTATION (CMI), P326, DOI 10.1109/CMI.2016.741376; Khubalkar S, 2017, TURK J ELECTR ENG CO, V25, P4223, DOI 10.3906/elk-1612-27; Khubalkar S, 2016, CIRC SYST SIGNAL PR, V35, P2189, DOI 10.1007/s00034-016-0262-; Khubalkar SW, 2018, ISA T, V82, P79, DOI 10.1016/j.isatra.2017.08.01; Krishna BT, 2011, SIGNAL PROCESS, V91, P386, DOI 10.1016/j.sigpro.2010.06.02; Muresan CI, 2013, MECHATRONICS, V23, P798, DOI 10.1016/j.mechatronics.2013.04.00; Naumovic MB, 2014, ELECTR ENG, V96, P267, DOI 10.1007/s00202-013-0292-; Ogata K., 1995, DISCRETE TIME CONTR; Oustaloup A, 2000, IEEE T CIRCUITS-I, V47, P25, DOI 10.1109/81.81738; Podlubny I, 1999, IEEE T AUTOMAT CONTR, V44, P208, DOI 10.1109/9.73914; Rapaic MR, 2011, ELECTR ENG, V93, P91, DOI 10.1007/s00202-011-0195-; Swain SK, 2017, AEU-INT J ELECTRON C, V78, P141, DOI 10.1016/j.aeue.2017.05.02; Tenreiro Machado J.

The Internet of Things (IoT), in which objects and objects from active relationships such as sensing, networking and mutual cooperation without human intervention is the core technology of the fourth Industrial Revolution, which can be linked to various industrial fields. As the IoT environment spreads, IoT devices are continuously increasing in various industries. IoT devices connected to the Internet are as different as each application environment. Many information is derived from the interaction between an IoT device and a device or between a human and an IoT device, as well as devices that provide simple data such as sensing. This paper proposes a support method to enable extended service search when users search for services using information generated in IoT environment. The existing service discovery method focuses on the method by which the user selects the service based on the simple service information disclosed by the service provider. In order to solve the problem of existing service discovery method, this study proposed a support method that enables users to search service discovery flexibly even when using existing methods in service discovery in IoT environment. The proposed method provides a user-centered service search environment construction through a search method using user IoT information which was not considered in the existing service search. This makes up for the problem of service availability and provider-oriented service discovery through the establishment of a user service discovery environment.","[Sim, Sungho] Semyung Univ, Sch Informat & Commun Sci, Jecheon, South Korea; [Choi, Hanyong] Shinhan Univ, Div IT Convergence Engn, Dongducheon, South Korea","Choi, H (corresponding author), Shinhan Univ, Div IT Convergence Engn, Dongducheon, South Korea.",hychoi@shinhan.ac.kr,,,,,"Atzori L, 2010, COMPUT NETW, V54, P2787, DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2010.05.01; Bormann C, 2010, IETF J, V; Gubbi J, 2013, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V29, P1645, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2013.01.01; Hai ZG, 2004, J SYST SOFTWARE, V70, P107, DOI [10.1016/S0164-1212(03)00003-7, 10.1016/S0164-1212(02)00003-7; Harshavardhanan P., 2012, COMP COMM INF ICCCI, P; Hyung-Jun Yim, 2014, Journal of KIISE: Computing Practices and Letters, V20, P4; Lee STM, 2016, FRONT MICROBIOL, V7, DOI 10.3389/fmicb.2016.0037; 김미정, 2017, [Korean Computers and Accounting Review, 전산회계연구], V15, P; Object Management Group, 2006, DAT DISTR SERV REA; Platzer C, 2005, Third European Conference on Web Services, Proceedings, P6; Sajjanhar A, 2004, AS PAC WEB C HANGZH, P65; Schmidt E., 2013, NEW DIGITAL AGE, P31; Youngsang K, 2017, KOREA I INFORM TECHN, V15, P; Zanella A, 2014, IEEE INTERNET THINGS, V1, P22, DOI 10.1109/JIOT.2014.230632",14,7,7,1,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This paper presents an instructional approach involving FEM simulations in order to aid in the practical operations on electrical contacts in MV and HV electrical apparatuses effectively. Prior to the completed engineering and scientific work in the field of the electrical apparatuses, constructing the FEM-based model is an effective way to achieve and understand the pros and cons of the experimental solutions. This design method is widely used by the industrial companies and can be implemented as an educational method giving young engineers a new edge. The desired effect of the proposed course was to develop student understanding of electrical contacts engineering by combining the theoretical (simulations) and the practical approach. Ordered creativity was successfully put into practice by checking the parameters derived from the simulations on the real scale layout, which affected and enhanced student confidence in the field and in engineering skills. This instructional approach consisted of two sections (The Theoretical and the Practical) and is essential for understanding and further exploiting the acquired knowledge and certain other measures in engineering work. Moreover, it renders a complete engineering experience employing consequences and their impact on experimental electrical contact research based on multitasking and diversity. The statistical analysis proved that the proposed method had a significant impact and yielded improved results. Moreover, a major improvement in student learning and satisfaction after participating in the proposed course was noted.","[Kolimas, Lukasz; Lapczynski, Sebastian; Szulborski, Michal] Warsaw Univ Technol, Inst Elect Power Engn, Ul Koszykowa 75, PL-00662 Warsaw, Poland","Szulborski, M (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Technol, Inst Elect Power Engn, Ul Koszykowa 75, PL-00662 Warsaw, Poland.",mm.szulborski@gmail.com,"Szulborski, Michał/AHC-9746-2022",,,,"Abdulwahed M, 2014, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC, V22, P110, DOI 10.1002/cae.2053; Bird J., 2003, ELECT CIRCUIT THEOR; Braunovic M, 2010, ELECTR CONTACT, P28; Braunovic M, 2006, SERIES ELECT COMPUTE, P67; Cabecinhas D, 2016, IEEE T CONTR SYST T, V24, P400, DOI 10.1109/TCST.2015.245444; Chou YC., 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V2019, P1, DOI [10.1177/0020720919834669, DOI 10.1177/0020720919834669; Feisel LD, 2005, J ENG EDUC, V94, P121, DOI 10.1002/j.2168-9830.2005.tb00833.; Glennie J., 2012, UNESCO COMMONWEALTH, P1; Guzman JL, 2013, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC, V21, P360, DOI 10.1002/cae.2048; Guzman JL, 2016, IEEE CONTR SYST MAG, V36, P63, DOI 10.1109/MCS.2015.249509; Ionescu CM, 2013, IEEE T EDUC, V56, P436, DOI 10.1109/TE.2013.224951; Jong BS, 2013, IEEE T EDUC, V56, P292, DOI 10.1109/TE.2012.221737; Kuffel E., 2000, HIGH VOLTAGE ENG FU; Li H., 2015, ASSESS EVAL HIGH EDU, V41, P24; Lundquist C, 2013, IEEE T EDUC, V56, P261, DOI 10.1109/TE.2012.221187; Margaryan A., 2008, WORK BASED LEARNIN; Merrill M.

Many studies focus on the process of vacuum application but the process of vacuum removal is generally ignored. Different from observations on surcharge preloading, ground settlement rather than heave occurred during vacuum removal. In this study, a stress-controlled triaxial test was carried out to simulate both processes of vacuum application and removal applied on a clayey soil and hence the mechanism of ground settlement induced by vacuum removal is discussed. Compressive axial strain was observed during the decrease of isotropic stress that simulated vacuum removal. To better understand the observed deformation characteristics of the clayey soils during vacuum removal, in this study, a simple anisotropic elastic model was used. The happening of ground settlement of the clayey soil during vacuum removal is mainly because that the Young's modulus in the vertical direction is higher than that in the horizontal direction. Lateral extension is dominant for the ground deformation during vacuum removal.","[Liu, Jian; Liang, Chuanyang; Wu, Yuedong] Hohai Univ, Geotech Res Inst, Key Lab Minist Educ Geomech & Embankment Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Rui] Harbin Inst Technol, Shenzhen Sch, Shenzhen Key Lab Urban & Civil Engn Disaster Prev, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Mei, Guoxiong] Guangxi Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Key Lab Disaster Prevent & Struct Safety, Minist Educ, Nanning, Peoples R China","Chen, R (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Shenzhen Sch, Shenzhen Key Lab Urban & Civil Engn Disaster Prev, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",chenrui1005@hotmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51608152, 51322807]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2019B73814]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province China [2016A030310368]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0404803]; Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [SJKY19_0449]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors thank for the support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos 51608152 and No. 51322807), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2018b00714 and 2015B25914), the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province China (No. 2016A030310368), National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2017YFC0404803), Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (No. SJKY19_0449) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2019B73814).","[Anonymous], 2007, STANDARD TEST METHO; ASTM, 2017, D431817 ASTM IN; ASTM D2487-11, 2011, D248711 ASTM IN; ATKINSON JH, 1990, GEOTECHNIQUE, V40, P531, DOI 10.1680/geot.1990.40.4.53; Bergado DT, 2002, CAN GEOTECH J, V39, P304, DOI 10.1139/T01-10; Chai JC, 2005, J GEOTECH GEOENVIRON, V131, P1552, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2005)131:12(1552; Chakrabarty J., 2006, THEORY PLASTICIT; Chen R, 2019, EUR J SOIL SCI, V70, P493, DOI 10.1111/ejss.1276; Chen R, 2019, J HYDROL, V568, P260, DOI 10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.10.05; Chu J, 2012, INT J GEOMECH, V5, P15; Holtz RD., 1975, J TRANSPORT RES BOAR, V548, P2; Indraratna B, 2004, CAN GEOTECH J, V41, P1098, DOI [10.1139/t04-054, 10.1139/T04-054; Kianfar K, 2015, CAN GEOTECH J, V52, P2156, DOI 10.1139/cgj-2014-051; Lings ML, 2000, GEOTECHNIQUE, V50, P109, DOI 10.1680/geot.2000.50.2.10; Muir WD., 2004, GEOTECHNICAL MODELL; Noble CA., 2011, CAN GEOTECH J, V3, P3; Noorzad R, 2014, ARAB J GEOSCI, V7, P623, DOI 10.1007/s12517-012-0771-; Pennington DS, 1997, GEOTECHNIQUE, V47, P391, DOI 10.1680/geot.1997.47.3.39; Robinson RG, 2012, CAN GEOTECH J, V49, P729, DOI [10.1139/t2012-024, 10.1139/T2012-024; Samson L, 2011, CAN GEOTECH J, V9, P44; Scher AD, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P367, DOI 10.1177/002072091877504; Schofield AN., 1968, CRITICAL STATE SOI; Shi JW, 2019, COMPUT GEOTECH, V116, DOI 10.1016/j.compgeo.2019.10321; Shi JW, 2019, COMPUT GEOTECH, V106, P108, DOI 10.1016/j.compgeo.2018.10.01; Wang J, 2016, J GEOTECH GEOENVIRON, V142, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.000151; Wu Y, 2016, ENV EARTH SCI, V75, P1, DOI DOI 10.1007/S12665-015-4915-; Wu YD, 2016, J ZHEJIANG UNIV-SC A, V17, P565, DOI 10.1631/jzus.A160023; Yu SY, 2013, INT J NAV ARCH OCEAN, V5, P598, DOI 10.2478/IJNAOE-2013-015",28,0,0,1,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The gap of traffic resources among different regions will affect the coordinated development of regional economy and widen the gap of wealth among regions. Under the background of emphasizing the coordinated development of regional economy in China, it is particularly important to study the allocation and utilization rate of highway resources in China. Based on the data of 31 provincial administrative regions from 2000 to 2014, this paper combines the Dagum Gini coefficient decomposition method with the extended distribution dynamics model to study the dynamic evolution of regional gap and distribution of highway scale from the perspective of quantity and quality. It is found that the gap of quality is more severe than that of quantity in China. The quality gap between East China and West China is the greatest, while the quantity gap is smaller, which indicates that China should pay attention to the utilization rate of highway resources while emphasizing the rational allocation, and check whether the supply of resources in the regions with busy and developed logistics services meets the demand while promoting economic growth by improving traffic accessibility.","[Sheng, Xin] Jiangsu Open Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Sheng, Xin] Guangzhou Panyu Polytech, Sch Management, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Lin, Xiaoci; Wu, Zeying; Chen, Jiayi; Liu, Biyu; Zhong, Zuchang] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Business, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Deng, Lijun] Fuzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou, Peoples R China","Deng, LJ (corresponding author), Fuzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou, Peoples R China.",dlj7425@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673064]; Innovation team project (HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES) of universities in Guangdong [2017WCXTD003]; Philosophy and Social Sciences in Guangzhou [2018GZGJ194]; Yangcheng young scholars' Foundation [17QNXR12]; Social Sciences Planning Project of the Panyu Polytechnic [2016SK007],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant: 71673064), Innovation team project (HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES) of universities in Guangdong (Grant: 2017WCXTD003), Philosophy and Social Sciences in Guangzhou (Grant: 2018GZGJ194), Yangcheng young scholars' Foundation (Grant: 17QNXR12), Social Sciences Planning Project of the Panyu Polytechnic (Grant: 2016SK007).","Chen F, 2015, ECON GEOGR, V35, P7; Li N, 2010, MODERNIZATION MANAGE, P1; Li YT, 2012, AREAL RES DEV, V31, P14; Li Z.

Conventional gradient-based approaches for target recognition require lot of data to be trained on and require exhaustive training with high computational expense. Hence, when a new condition or untrained data is encountered, such systems inadequately misconfigure newly learned feature sets in the trained model. This misconfigures the structure of re-learned features and is then carried out in subsequent recognition stages. Thus, a development in this scenario with low training time will allow us to fend of this disadvantage. This study presents a new automatic target recognition framework that gives the enhanced performance of target-recognition system when several imaging sensors are connected with one another. This is in contrast with traditional automatic target recognition frameworks, which utilizes one-on-one computational model over synthetic-aperture radar image-processing systems. The work comprises of a learning-based classifications strategy when dealing with sharing of learned parameters over the network to discern critical changes in target-recognition performance by utilizing a novel one-shot learning-based reconfigurable learning network for image processing platform. This upgrades the networked connected CCTV and multiview synthetic-aperture radar image object identification and recognition process.","[Rai, Ankush; Kannan, R.

The trajectory planning strategies of Cartesian space and angular displacement, angular velocity and angular acceleration of three joints in high-speed handling are studied. Firstly, the critical trajectory points starting point and end point, and points for obstacle avoidance height are set up, and then according to the inverse kinematics model of the robot, a point-to-point door type moving trajectory is established, and the mapping relationship between the motion characteristics of the operating space and the motion characteristics of the joint space is established by using the 4-3-4 degree polynomial motion law in the operating space. However, aiming at the higher energy consumption of 4-3-4 degree polynomial interpolation caused by longer the trajectory, and difficult control of obstacle avoidance height, one key point is added. Thereby, the motion rules are interpolated by 4-3-3-4 degree polynomial interpolation, and the mapping relationship between the motion characteristics of the operating space and the motion characteristics of the joint space is established. Two trajectory planning methods are simultaneously simulated under the same keys points and the same trajectory time range. The motion characteristics of the joint rotation angle of the parallel robot between polynomial interpolations are respectively compared. The results show that the trajectory planning method based on 4-3-3-4 degree polynomial interpolation in joint space has obvious advantages in improving the running state of the delta parallel robot and reducing the energy consumption of the system.","[Liu, Cheng; Cao, Guohua] Changchun Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Liu, Cheng; Qu, Yongyin] Beihua Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Jilin, Jilin, Peoples R China","Cao, GH (corresponding author), Changchun Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",bhdqxy@163.com,,,Jilin Provincial Development and Reform Commission [2018C035-1]; Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Talents Team Project [20190101018JH]; Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Department [20160101276JC],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Jilin Provincial Development and Reform Commission (Grant: 2018C035-1), Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Talents & Team Project (Grant: 20190101018JH), and Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Department (Grant: 20160101276JC).","Brogardh T, 2007, ANNU REV CONTROL, V31, P69, DOI 10.1016/j.arcontrol.2007.01.00; Chen Xue-sheng, 2002, Robot, V24, P46; Gasparetto A, 2010, ADV ENG SOFTW, V41, P548, DOI 10.1016/j.advengsoft.2009.11.00; HE P, 2003, ROBOT, V25, P61; [居鹤华 Ju Hehua], 2012, [控制工程, Control Engineering of China], V19, P47; Liu HS, 2013, ROBOT CIM-INT MANUF, V29, P309, DOI 10.1016/j.rcim.2012.08.00; Mei Jiangping, 2016, Journal of Mechanical Engineering, V52, P9, DOI 10.3901/JME.2016.19.00; Moreno-Valenzuela J, 2017, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V54, P319, DOI 10.1177/002072091668910; Wang MM, 2015, ACTA ASTRONAUT, V112, P77, DOI 10.1016/j.actaastro.2015.03.00; Zhou Y, 2012, J SHANGHAI DIANJI U, V15, P23",10,0,0,2,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

A heterogeneous vehicular network is developed with the idea of utilizing the readily available infrastructures such as long-term evolution and dedicated short-range communication, which is economically profitable. We discussed some of the issues that arise when we converge dedicated short-range communication and long-term evolution and addressed certain issues such as creating a link to communicate between two different technologies that can be achieved by considering the baseband implementations of the two technologies in the physical layer and Media Access Control (MAC) levels. The efficiency of the system is observed at three distinguish multimedia transmission where a text file, audio file, and an image file are transmitted and the system's performance is observed by analyzing the bit error rate vs signal-to-noise ratio for each of the files.

The fractal features along with the local features are used to train the system. The deep neural network with three layers is used to train the system.

However, in courses related to digital communications or signal processing usually these simulations cannot be easily applied to real data or in real scenarios. This limitation does not allow the students to verify that the learned theoretical hypotheses are valid in practice. Nowadays, software defined radio platforms have been proposed to validate theoretical telecommunications concepts in real situations. Therefore, by combining a software defined radio and simulation tools, students can implement the learned notions over real data in real scenarios. This allows students to work under real applications in order to learn by experience and to see that the theoretical concepts are valid in the real world. This paper presents a project involving real-time decoding of automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) signals, implemented by using a universal software radio peripheral software defined radio and MATLAB (R). The universal software radio peripheral allows to receive real automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast signals sent by the aircraft. Then, by using MATLAB (R) tools, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast baseband signals are decoded. The students are guided through a manual to demodulate the real automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast signals and display in a map the aircraft trajectories. The evaluation is based on a competition between the students, considering execution time of their algorithms, and a final report of the project. This project allows to obtain a game-oriented and novel approach for teaching digital communications and signal processing. The implementation of this project in telecommunications engineering courses motivate the students, allowing them to understand better difficult theoretical concepts, and improve their computer, teamwork, and collaboration skills. The originality of the approach is based on the usage of a prototyping platform, combined with simulation tools, for practical application of telecommunications engineering concepts using real signals.","[Poveda, Hector] Univ Tecnol Panama, Fac Ingn Elect, Panama City, Panama; [Ferre, Guillaume; Tajan, Romain] Bordeaux Inst Technol, ENSEIRB MATMECA, Talence, France","Poveda, H (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Panama, Panama City, Panama.",hector.poveda@utp.ac.pa,,,"National Bureau of Science, Technology and Innovation of Panama through the project RAPIDO-5G [ITE15-021]; Sistema Nacional de Investigacion [SNI 153-2017]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is partially supported by the National Bureau of Science, Technology and Innovation of Panama through the project RAPIDO-5G (ITE15-021) and the Sistema Nacional de Investigacion (SNI 153-2017).","Abdulaziz A., 2015, AM J SIGNAL PROCESSI, V5, P2; [Anonymous], 2011, DO260B RTCA IN; Arpaio M., 2016, IEEE INT FOR RES TEC, P; Balanis C., 2005, ANTENNA THEORY ANAL, P85; El-Hajjar Mohammed, 2014, IEEE Communications Magazine, V52, P194, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2014.681591; Kim Y, 2017, IEEE AERO EL SYS MAG, V32, P52, DOI 10.1109/MAES.2018.16023; Kraszewski D, 1977, J MICROWAVE POWER, V12, P5; Varga M, 2015, 2015 38TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (TSP), P215, DOI 10.1109/TSP.2015.729625; Welch TB, 2012, INT CONF ACOUST SPEE, P2789, DOI 10.1109/ICASSP.2012.628849",9,0,0,2,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

It was found that the amplitude change rate of each frequency component of the engine was >30% and the maximum was 115%. And the amplitude change rate of the sieve was generally 170%-240%, with the maximum reaching 307.8%. Therefore, the engine and vibrating screen cannot be considered as a stable vibration source. The cutter excitation frequency was mainly concentrated on the fundamental frequency and frequency multiplier <80 Hz, the amplitude was more stable.","[Pang, Jing; Li, Yaoming; Xu, Lizhang] Jiangsu Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Modern Agr Equipment & Technol, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Pang, Jing; Jin, Xin] Henan Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Agr Equipment Engn, Luoyang, Peoples R China","Pang, J (corresponding author), Henan Univ Sci & Technol, Luoyang 471003, Peoples R China.",jing_pang@163.com,"Xu, Lizhang/AAX-1590-2021","Jin, Xin/0000-0002-2959-8865","National Natural Science Foundation of PR China [51205110, 31671590]; National Key Research and Development Program of China Subproject [2017YFD0700800]","The author(s) received the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of PR China (Contract No. 51205110 and Contract No. 31671590).

However, the derivation and understanding of it is difficult and there is standard literature that is not consistent and thus increases the difficulties. In order to gain a consistent and vivid derivation of the stress tensor for use in electrical engineering lectures, two common variants are analysed from a didactic as well as scientific point of view. It is shown that one variant is consistent whereas the other one can lead to contradictions in case of materials with permeability gradients and thus is not recommended for lectures. Moreover, the resulting tensors of both variants yield different force distributions. For the consistent variant, methods for clarifying the respective force distribution for use in lectures are derived. Finally, a brief consideration on the experimental provability of the results is carried out.","[Schleicher, A.; Werner, R.] Tech Univ Chemnitz, Saxony, Germany","Schleicher, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Chemnitz, D-09126 Chemnitz, Germany.",andre.schleicher@etzu-chemnitz.de,,,,,"Bermudez A, 2017, IEEE T MAGN, V53, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2016.263331; Chan Man Fong CF, 2003, ADV MATH ENG SCI, P30; Chikazumi S, 1997, PHYS FERROMAGNETISM, V2nd, P36; de Medeiros LH, 1999, IEEE T MAGN, V35, P1215, DOI 10.1109/20.76716; Gerlach W, 1922, Z PHYS, V9, P349, DOI 10.1007/BF0132698; Greiner W, 1991, HYDRODYNAMIK, P6; Henke H., 2015, ELEKTROMAGNETISCHE F, P22; Landau LD, 1984, ELECTRODYNAMICS CONT, P7; Meeker D., 2018, FINITE ELEMENT METH; Muller G, 2009, THEORIE ELEKT MASCHI, P1; Muller-Kirstein HJW., 2004, ELECTRODYNAMICS INTR, P16; Trachanas S., 2018, INTRO QUANTUM PHYS F, P28; [No title captured",13,0,0,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Here, the communicating membrane system is modeled based on several IoT devices connected in peer to peer form and the theory of fractional differential equations is as governing function over them. Here, the difficulty is in developing a collaborative learning algorithm for finding collaborative key points within high-dimensional decision space. In order to overcome such a problem, a gradient-based method is required to enable distributed control and collaborative decision making. Here, at every interval of the sampling time, all the subsystems are optimally synchronized in P population system by multiset-rewriting rules including the effect of symport/antiport systems. This is an interesting technical problem, related to the borderline between universality and non-universality of continuity of distributed coupling of multi-coupled control system. The presented study discusses the experimental proof of the algorithmic framework and model for SLAM operation. The consensus architecture in this domain will enable the development of evolving architecture of a non-linear cyber physical system. The close loop stability and the recursive feasibility of the evolved architecture are also studied.","[Rai, Ankush; Kannan, R.

Under these situations, if any Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) node wants to send the emergency data to sink/server, then that node may face harsh traffic load conditions in various routes, therefore many times end-to-end delay occurs while sending emergency data. To find the best optimized possible solution for this problem, we proposed an intelligent self-learning and educating algorithm, which uses reinforcement learning technique, shortest path algorithm along with convex-hull algorithm for creation of safe path (green corridor) to send data packets from any node to sink/server in emergency situation on priority basis. This approach is beneficial for engineers (industry/students) to better deal with real-time emergency situations and education purpose. Mainly our proposed learning algorithm selects certain WSN nodes based upon their link quality and higher residual energy to create safe path (green corridor) for emergency situation. The performance of this learning algorithm has been tested in MATLAB and Contiki Cooja simulator under heavy traffic conditions along with various performance parameters like Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) ratio, end-to-end delay, energy consumption and better throughput.

IoT can offer solutions for many problems. However, it requires many skills from different disciplines that current electrical and computer engineers lack. In order to encourage the seamless internalization of the IoT and the technologies it supports, a new method should be considered in training electrical and computer engineers. The new methods should focus on applications and projects that involve the use of components such as hardware, software, and cloud platforms that are available in the market rather than class oriented theories. In this study, we introduce a methodology for teaching an IoT systems course that will encourage students to study how to develop and accomplish IoT applications in real time, at a reasonable cost, and for general use rather than meeting the detailed needs of one merchant. We exploit universally available open source software and cloud platforms to enhance teaching IoT course. The proposed course is taught at the undergraduate level in the computer engineering departments of Kocaeli and Sakarya Universities in Turkey. The results show that the designed method can have a constructive influence on the progress of computer engineering education by timely and positive assistance in educating the new IoT engineers.","[Kucuk, Kerem; Msongaleli, Dawson Ladislaus] Kocaeli Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Umuttepe Campus, TR-41380 Kocaeli, Turkey; [Bayilmis, Cuneyt] Sakarya Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Sakarya, Turkey","Kucuk, K (corresponding author), Kocaeli Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Umuttepe Campus, TR-41380 Kocaeli, Turkey.",kkucuk@kocaeli.edu.tr,"Bayilmis, Cuneyt/ABI-4012-2020; Kucuk, Kerem/V-6486-2017","Bayilmis, Cuneyt/0000-0003-1058-7100; Kucuk, Kerem/0000-0002-2621-634X",,,"[Anonymous], MIT APP INV LIB DO; Atzori L, 2010, COMPUT NETW, V54, P2787, DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2010.05.01; Byrne JR, 2017, IEEE T EDUC, V60, P50, DOI 10.1109/TE.2016.262625; Chtourou S, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P62, DOI 10.1177/002072091775095; Corno F, 2017, IEEE T EDUC, V60, P40, DOI 10.1109/TE.2016.260878; Corno F, 2016, IT PROF, V18, P50, DOI 10.1109/MITP.2016.10; Feki MA, 2013, COMPUTER, V46, P24, DOI 10.1109/MC.2013.6; Guzelgoz S, 2010, IEEE T EDUC, V53, P532, DOI 10.1109/TE.2009.203216; Gupta A, 2015, 2015 THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON IMAGE INFORMATION PROCESSING (ICIIP), P285, DOI 10.1109/ICIIP.2015.741478; Hwang YM, 2017, EDUC MEDIA INT, V54, P83, DOI 10.1080/09523987.2017.136283; Jan C.

While these development platforms solve many low-level challenges, getting started with embedded system prototyping may seem overwhelming for novices. Choosing novice friendly sensors can make a substantial difference. In this paper, a framework for selecting sensors for novice use is presented and accessibility obstacles are defined. Six learning barriers in end-user programming are adopted for evaluating obstacles effecting on novice usability. Four properties for evaluating sensors and to overcome the barriers are presented: protocol complexity, connection type and component size, understandable real-life phenomena measured and documentation. Sensor protocol complexity and documentation are identified as key factors affecting implementation challenges.","[Karvinen, Kimmo] Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Automat & Syst Technol, Maarintie 8, Espoo, Finland","Karvinen, K (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Automat & Syst Technol, Maarintie 8, Espoo, Finland.",kimmo.karvinen@iki.fi,,"Karvinen, Kimmo/0000-0003-3946-4163",,,"Ahmadzadeh M., 2005, SIGCSE Bulletin, V37, P8; Alqadi BS, 2017, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 ACM SIGCSE TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION (SIGCSE'17), P15, DOI 10.1145/3017680.301776; Blikstein P., 2013, P 12 INT C INT DES C, P17; Bonarini A, 2014, ROBOT AUTON SYST, V62, P1073, DOI 10.1016/j.robot.2013.08.00; Booth T, 2015, PROCEEDINGS 2015 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON VISUAL LANGUAGES AND HUMAN-CENTRIC COMPUTING (VL/HCC), P299, DOI 10.1109/VLHCC.2015.735723; Cuellar MP, 2014, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC, V22, P153, DOI 10.1002/cae.2054; Eichbaum QG, 2013, DIAGN STAND CARE, P2; Jamieson P., 2010, P FECS, P28; Jamieson P., 2015, 2015 IEEE FRONT ED C, P; Karvinen K, 2014, MAKE SENSORS HANDS ; Karvinen K, 2015, J SMALL SATELL JOSS, V4, P; Karvinen K, 2018, INT J ENG EDUC, V34, P26; Karvinen Kimmo, 2016, WORLD T ENG TECHNOL, V14, P34; Kelleher C, 2005, ACM COMPUT SURV, V37, P83, DOI 10.1145/1089733.108973; Kim SH, 2009, IEEE T EDUC, V52, P99, DOI 10.1109/TE.2008.91980; Ko AJ, 2004, 2004 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON VISUAL LANGUAGES AND HUMAN CENTRIC COMPUTING: PROCEEDINGS, P19; Lahtinen E., 2005, ACM SIGCSE B, V37, P14, DOI [10.1145/1151954.1067453, DOI 10.1145/1151954.1067453; Pane JF, 2001, INT J HUM-COMPUT ST, V54, P237, DOI 10.1006/ijhc.2000.041; Parisi C., 2014, P WORKSH NAN AGR SEC, DOI [10.2791/80497, DOI 10.2791/80497; Pearce JM, 2012, SCIENCE, V337, P1303, DOI 10.1126/science.122818; Robins A., 2003, COMPUTER SCI ED, V13, P137, DOI [DOI 10.1076/CSED.13.2.137.14200, 10.1076/csed.13.2.137.14200; Sadler J., 2015, P 9 INT C TANG EMB E, P347, DOI [10.1145/2677199.2680581, DOI 10.1145/2677199.2680581; Sadler JA., 2016, THESI; Severance C, 2014, COMPUTER, V47, P11, DOI 10.1109/MC.2014.1; Soriano A., 2014, PROC 19THWORLD C INT, P904; Sykes A, 2011, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON E-LEARNING, VOLS 1 AND 2, P82; Winslow L.

However, in the usual teaching process, teachers often teach this knowledge using some simple examples of analysis and calculation but without deep discussions. As a result, students could not have a deep understanding about these concepts or not apply the concepts on actual problems flexibly. Therefore, passive learning habits are formed. The lack of self-exploration awareness and comprehensive ability would result in a poor learning effect. This paper designs a specific application scene of Kirchhoff's circuit laws using a multi-channel resistor network. With this application, students can construct the knowledge system autonomously, find the problems proactively, solve the problems timely, and combine the research-based autonomous learning with extracurricular open mutual learning; so, their active learning ability will be promoted to a large extent. Compared with the past teaching methods, this pedagogical case highlights the following advantages of active learning. Firstly, it highlights the process of guiding students to study the object from a small-scale resistor network to a complex and large-scale multi-channel resistor network. Secondly, it embodies the concrete application of calculus knowledge in various basic courses with the help of perfect mathematical deduction. Thirdly, it exercises students' programming ability by using MATLAB to numerically simulate theoretical results. Finally, this case practices students' hands-on experimental ability by constructing real resistor circuits and verifying the theory and simulation results. In addition, we get good feedback from students on the teaching effect through the questionnaire survey.","[Kang, Rui; Lin, Yixuan] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Optoelect Informat, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuexin] Univ Elect Sci & Technol, UoG UESTC Joint Sch, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hao; Wu, Minghe; Teng, Baohua] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Phys Elect, Chengdu 610054, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Teng, BH (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Phys Elect, Chengdu 610054, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",phytbh@163.com,"Kang, Rui/AAF-5175-2021","Kang, Rui/0000-0002-1564-8753; Teng, Baohua/0000-0003-0731-9316",,,"Alexander C.

It is a challenge for robotics course professors to get students to clearly understand the basic theoretical concepts for its correct application to solve problems, and to motivate them to achieve the best performance. Previous works proposed the use of 3D models to perform the simulation of industrial robots in class and consequently to reinforce the students' theoretical and practical concepts. However, it has not yet been clearly demonstrated how the use of robots and simulations helps improve students' academic performance. In this paper, the main contribution consists of a formal evaluation in which the comparison between the use of two teaching methods was carried out. In the first teaching method (traditional method), the professor used PowerPoint presentations and oral explanations to teach theoretical concepts and solve exercises (Group A). In the second teaching method, the professor added the use of 3D simulations together with the traditional method to teach theoretical concepts and solve exercises (Group B). Students of both groups performed the same written exam about forward kinematics in order to study and analyse the differences between the methodology used with Group A and the methodology used with Group B. This exam consisted of solving three exercises with different robot complexity levels. The results demonstrate that the performance of the students in group B is significantly better than that of the students in group A. In other words, the use of 3D simulations improves student's academic performance, and provides a teaching tool to enhance the way the professors teach.","[Loreto-Gomez, Gerardo] Inst Tecnol Super Uruapan, Dept Ingn Mecatron, Uruapan, Mexico; [Rodriguez-Arce, Jorge; Montano-Serrano, Victor M.] Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Fac Ingn, Ciudad Univ Cerro de Coatepec S-N, Toluca 50110, Mexico; [Gonzalez-Garcia, Salvador] Tecnol Monterrey, Dept Reg Comp & Mecatron, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias Reg Ctr, Campus Morelia, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico","Rodriguez-Arce, J (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Fac Ingn, Ciudad Univ Cerro de Coatepec S-N, Toluca 50110, Mexico.",jrodrigueza@uaemex.mx,"RODRIGUEZ-ARCE, JORGE/AAH-2945-2020","RODRIGUEZ-ARCE, JORGE/0000-0003-0289-7061; Montano-Serrano, Victor Manuel/0000-0002-3228-2773; Loreto, Gerardo/0000-0002-3960-8801",,,"Antonelli G, 2009, MATHMOD 0; Braunl T, 2007, AM ASS ART INT FAL; Cao Y, 2011, ASEE ANNU CONF EXP; Carpin S, 2007, IEEE INT C ROB AUT, DOI [10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363180, DOI 10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363180; Craig J., 2009, INTRO ROBOTICS MEC; Dale E., 1946, AUDIO VISUAL METHODS, P3; Denavit J., 1955, J APPL MECH, V22, P21; Dunn T.

It implies a complex multidisciplinary panorama which includes ongoing subjects for which traditional electrical and computer engineers are not entirely ready. As the implementation of Smart-Grid is imminent, high-skilled professionals are needed to absorb the research, labor, business, logistics, and innovation issues of today and tomorrow. This leads to a transformation of the education role for undergraduate programs which is now, accordingly, urged to build up students' research skills. In this paper, a case study is presented to introduce and asses a new teaching/evaluation methodology intended to build critical thinking, objectivity, and ingenuity among mechanical-electrical undergraduate students during a one-semester course on Smart-Grid. The results show that the proposed technique may improve the aforementioned research skills within the group of students. Overall, the proposed methodology can be used as a protocol to guide new research cases and to frame similar educational proposals.","[Ponce, Pedro; Ibarra, Luis; Mata, Omar; Molina, Arturo] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Engn & Sci, Mexico City 14380, DF, Mexico","Ibarra, L (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Engn & Sci, Mexico City 14380, DF, Mexico.",ibarra.luis@itesm.mx,"Ibarra, Luis/W-9477-2019; Molina, Arturo/AAS-7147-2020","Ibarra, Luis/0000-0002-7290-3001; Molina, Arturo/0000-0001-5461-2879; Ponce, Pedro/0000-0001-7035-5286; Mata, Omar/0000-0002-2432-358X","CONACYT SENER Fund for Energy Sustainability [266632, S0019201401]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is a product of the Project 266632 Laboratorio Binacional para la Gestion Inteligente de la Sustentabilidad Energetica y la Formacion Tecnologica (Bi-National Laboratory on Smart Sustainable Energy Management and Technology Training), funded by the CONACYT SENER Fund for Energy Sustainability (Agreement: S0019201401).","Afdal HW, 2018, TEACH TEACH EDUC, V74, P215, DOI 10.1016/j.tate.2018.05.01; Alayon S, 2013, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC, V21, pE121, DOI 10.1002/cae.2053; [Anonymous], 2009, CASE STUDY RES DESI; Beringer J, 2007, J GEOGR HIGHER EDUC, V31, P445, DOI 10.1080/0309826070151403; Brown H.E., 2010, ELECT J, V23, P64, DOI [10.1016/j.tej.2010.05.005, DOI 10.1016/J.TEJ.2010.05.005; DeLorenzo Group, SMART GRI; Durham MF, 2017, CBE-LIFE SCI EDUC, V1; Fajri P, 2016, IEEE INTEL TRANSP SY, V8, P8, DOI 10.1109/MITS.2015.250573; Ghasem N, 2016, EUR J ENG EDUC, V41, P455, DOI 10.1080/03043797.2015.109515; Heydt G., 2009, P IEEE POW EN SOC GE, P; Hu QR, 2015, IEEE T EDUC, V58, P32, DOI 10.1109/TE.2014.232152; Huet I, 2018, EUR J ENG EDUC, V43, P725, DOI 10.1080/03043797.2017.141529; Ilic M., 2010, POW EN SOC GEN M IEE, P; Kember D, 2000, HIGH EDUC, V40, P69, DOI 10.1023/A:100406850031; Kezunovic M, 2010, IEEE POW ENER SOC G; Lunardi L, 2013, ASEE ANNU CONF EXP; Mathworks, 2016, PHYS SYST SIM SIM; McKenna AF, 2016, EUR J ENG EDUC, V41, P411, DOI 10.1080/03043797.2015.108583; Micari M, 2016, EUR J ENG EDUC, V41, P380, DOI 10.1080/03043797.2015.107981; Momoh J.A., 2012, SMART GRID FUNDAMEN; Monemi SS., 2011, 2011 ASEE ANN C EX; Moslehi K, 2010, IEEE T SMART GRID, V1, P57, DOI 10.1109/TSG.2010.204634; Mwasilu F, 2014, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V34, P501, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2014.03.03; Pons D, 2016, EUR J ENG EDUC, V41, P530, DOI 10.1080/03043797.2015.109516; Srivastava AK, 2017, IEEE T POWER SYST, V32, P2267, DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2016.261158; Srivastava K., 2012, POW EN SOC GEN M IEE, P; Strasser T, 2014, IEEE T POWER SYST, V29, P1989, DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2014.230574; Tlhoaele M, 2016, EUR J ENG EDUC, V41, P263, DOI 10.1080/03043797.2015.105610; Tuballa ML, 2016, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V59, P710, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2016.01.01; TURMEAU WA, 1982, HIGH EDUC, V11, P397, DOI 10.1007/BF0015765; Turner MJ, 2017, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V54, P299, DOI 10.1177/002072091668731",31,10,10,2,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This method transforms the analog filter to a digital filter by applying bilinear transformation equations, which allows the students explore the various characteristics of digital filter, such as low pass filter, high pass filter, band pass filter and band stop filter. That means Laplace equation transformed by inductance, capacitance and resistance will be replaced by the z equation, which is used for deriving sequence of difference equations. In the case studies, the clinical EMGdi is used to show the features of the developed method. Furthermore, classroom experience in the Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University has shown that the developed method helps in consolidating a better understanding of signal de-noising processing in digital signal processing course.","[Luo, Guo] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Luo, G (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",185616509@qq.com,,,,,"ARY JP, 1979, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V26, P696, DOI 10.1109/TBME.1979.32646; Chapman R, 2000, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V48, P854, DOI 10.1109/78.82467; Jolley CJ, 2015, EUR RESPIR J, V45, P355, DOI 10.1183/09031936.0006301; Martinez-Torres MR, 2005, IEEE T EDUC, V48, P422, DOI 10.1109/TE.2005.84973; Meyer-Base U, 2010, IEEE T EDUC, V53, P638, DOI 10.1109/TE.2009.203921; Norilo V, 2015, COMPUT MUSIC J, V39, P30, DOI 10.1162/COMJ_a_0033; Shankar PM, 2016, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V53, P291, DOI 10.1177/002072091562247; Wei C, 2007, DIGIT SIGNAL PROCESS, V17, P50, DOI 10.1016/j.dsp.2006.04.00; Yu C, 2002, IEEE T CONSUM ELECTR, V43, P127; Zhuge QF, 2004, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V52, P1090, DOI 10.1109/TSP.2004.82350",10,7,7,6,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

One of the main issues of e-learning, especially in engineering education, is the lack of online educational laboratories. Practical work remains a considerable burden as engineering educational programs focus on handling real equipment. These last are only accessible within a restrictive schedule and might be unaffordable for low budget institutions. The need is clear for interactive platforms that enhance the motivation and controls the regulation of workload for each student. In this paper, an overview about online laboratories is given and a simple approach of remote lab is suggested. The proposal of our research team (Team SEITI) can be used for carrying-out experiments that require neither assembly nor physical changes until the results are obtained unless a technician, that must be present in the laboratory, acts on equipment. The idea is to set up a real-time measurement retrieval laboratory that requires the involvement of a technician to act on instruments and will grant access to a large scale of students.","[Zine, Othmane; Errouha, Mustapha; Zamzoum, Othmane; Derouich, Aziz; Talbi, Abdennebi] Univ Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah, Higher Sch Technol Fez, Lab PE2D, Team SEITI, Fes, Morocco","Zine, O (corresponding author), Univ Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah, Higher Sch Technol Fez, Lab PE2D, Team SEITI, Fes, Morocco.",othmane.zine@usmba.ac.ma,"errouha, mustapha/L-6700-2018","ZINE, Othmane/0000-0002-6429-1666; Derouich, Aziz/0000-0003-4598-5002",,,"Aktan B, 1996, IEEE T EDUC, V39, P320, DOI 10.1109/13.53875; Asumadu JA, 2005, IEEE T INSTRUM MEAS, V54, P38, DOI 10.1109/TIM.2004.83459; Auer ME23.

Two second-year classes in electrical engineering at the University Tahri Mohamed in Bechar, Algeria, were involved in the study. The experiment compared the level to which one class of students mastered goals without the use of information and communication technologies, to the mastery achieved by a second class which participated in a tutorial that has a technological tool built into the project-based approach. The subject of power electronics was chosen for this study because of its different knowledge, which is strongly represented in difficult learning contents for students. A questionnaire about motivation was used to collect data within an experimental research plan. After three months of conducting the study, the results demonstrated that the integration of the tutorial with the project-based approach is likely to increase students' motivation to learn and to master the subject of power electronics.","[Belagra, Mammar; Draoui, Belkacem] Bechar Univ, 110 Cite 160 Logement, Bechar 08000, Algeria","Belagra, M (corresponding author), Bechar Univ, 110 Cite 160 Logement, Bechar 08000, Algeria.",maamar_didact@yahoo.fr,"DRAOUI, Belkacem/AAE-1461-2019","DRAOUI, Belkacem/0000-0001-5490-3991",,,"AMES C, 1992, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V84, P261, DOI 10.1037/0022-0663.84.3.26; Ames C., 1992, STUDENT PERCEPTIONS, P32; Archambault J, 1996, VERS GESTION ED CLA; Arpin L, 2001, APPRENTISSAGE PROJET, P25; Bernet E., 2002, THESI; Bernet E., 2010, THESI; Campos-Delgado DU, 2010, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V47, P430, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.47.4.; Chiang C.

In electric circuits textbooks, the transformation is found by comparing the two networks and making sure that the resistance between each pair of nodes in one network is the same as the resistance between the same pair of nodes in the other network. The two networks are compared as open-circuit networks. This creates confusion among students because usually the network is part of a larger closedcircuit network. In this paper, an alternative method is proposed. The new method starts from one configuration and finds the corresponding equivalent configuration by deriving currents and voltages, as part of a closed circuit. This method can be adopted in circuit analysis courses to help students develop a deeper understanding of this topic.","[Arabasi, Sameer] German Jordanian Univ, Dept Phys, POB 35247, Amman 11180, Jordan","Arabasi, S (corresponding author), German Jordanian Univ, Dept Phys, POB 35247, Amman 11180, Jordan.",sameer.arabasi@gju.edu.jo,,"Arabasi, Sameer/0000-0001-6645-7802",,,"Alexander C.K., 1989, FUNDAMENTALS ELECT ; Baser M, 2010, EURASIA J MATH SCI T, V6, P4; DIRECTOR SW, 1995, P IEEE, V83, P1246, DOI 10.1109/5.40642; Engelhardt PV, 2004, AM J PHYS, V72, P98, DOI 10.1119/1.161481; Frederiksen JR, 1999, J RES SCI TEACH, V36, P806, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2736(199909)36:7<806::AID-TEA5>3.0.CO;2-; Geban O., 2008, RES SCI TECHNOLOGICA, V25, P243, DOI [https://doi.org/10.1080/02635140701250857, DOI 10.1080/02635140701250857; Gunstone R, 2009, RES SCI EDUC, V39, P515, DOI 10.1007/s11165-008-9092-; Hart C, 2008, RES SCI EDUC, V38, P529, DOI 10.1007/s11165-007-9060-; Jaakkola T, 2010, USE EXTERNAL REPRESE, P13; Jaakkola T, 2011, J RES SCI TEACH, V48, P71, DOI 10.1002/tea.2038; Jacob J.

According to the student feedback, this approach allowed gathering his main interests - vector control, microcontroller programming and wind power generation - together, therefore reinforcing his motivation towards his final year project and making him feel particularly responsible for its outcome. Microcontroller-based hardware-in-the-loop emulation made possible to combine the three afore-cited student interests. In this context, the virtual prototype of a current-controlled wind turbine-driven 2-MW permanent-magnet synchronous generator is presented, along with the pseudo-code corresponding to the permanent-magnet synchronous generator speed control algorithm programmed in an 8-bit microcontroller. In addition, tuning formulas are derived for the digital integral-proportional controllers commanding both the permanent-magnet synchronous generator current and speed. Detailed descriptions are provided in order to guarantee reproducibility. Implementation of the hardware-in-the-loop rig is also tackled, supported by illustrative results obtained when running it. The developed hardware-in-the-loop rig is considered suitable for laboratory practices of subjects like digital control and microcontroller programming.","[Larruscain, Gorka; Tapia, Gerardo; Susperregui, Ana; Itsaso Martinez, M.] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Fac Engn, Dept Automat Control & Syst Engn, San Sebastian, Spain","Tapia, G (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Fac Engn, Plaza Europa 1, San Sebastian 20018, Spain.",gerardo.tapia@ehu.eus,"Tapia, Gerardo/P-4160-2017; Susperregui, Ana/Q-9323-2018; Martínez, Miren Itsaso/ABF-1201-2020","Tapia, Gerardo/0000-0002-6224-9595; Susperregui, Ana/0000-0002-0803-7049; Martinez Aguirre, Miren Itsaso/0000-0002-3286-6744",,,"Baltic M, 2014, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V51, P204, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.51.3.; Fragoso S, 2016, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC, V24, P400, DOI 10.1002/cae.2171; Geng H, 2009, IET RENEW POWER GEN, V3, P168, DOI 10.1049/iet-rpg:2007004; Goodwin GC, 2011, IEEE T EDUC, V54, P48, DOI 10.1109/TE.2010.204343; Gunasekaran M, 2012, IEEE T EDUC, V55, P508, DOI 10.1109/TE.2012.219244; Ibrahim D, 2003, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V40, P175, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.40.3.; Ibrahim D., 2006, MICROCONTROLLER BAS; KUO BC, 1992, DIGITAL CONTROL SYS; Montesinos-Miracle D, 2009, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V46, P183, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.46.2.; Ogata K., 2001, MODERN CONTROL ENG, V4t; Rodriguez-Ponce R, 2015, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V52, P219, DOI 10.1177/002072091557592; Rodriguez-Resendiz J, 2011, IEEE T EDUC, V54, P657, DOI 10.1109/TE.2011.210621; Short M, 2011, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V48, P339, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.48.4.; Tapia G, 2006, IEEE T ENERGY CONVER, V21, P909, DOI 10.1109/TEC.2005.85997; TOLIYAT HA, 2004, POW ELE APP, pNIL; Troni G, 2013, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V50, P395, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.50.4.; Vas P., 1998, SENSORLESS VECTOR D; Welch T.

Problem identification and formulation, applying mathematical and engineering knowledge for solving a problem, and design and synthesis of the final product are some of the outcomes that the students achieve upon completing such projects. In this paper, the design of an electrodynamic suspension system, in which an aluminium disc suspended above two concentric coils, is considered. The mathematical description is presented and proved that the value of electromagnetic force exerted on the disc is proportional to the inverse square of its height. The system is then simulated with a finite element method software and the effects of varying different system's parameters on the exerted force are studied through simulation results. Analytical calculations and simulation results are validated by being compared with experimental measurements, which show a close agreement.","[Ghayoor, Farzad; Swanson, A.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Elect Elect & Comp Engn, Durban, South Africa","Ghayoor, F (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Howard Coll, Elect Elect & Comp Engn, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa.",ghayoor@ukzn.ac.za,,"Ghayoor, Farzad/0000-0001-5780-6767; Swanson, Andrew/0000-0002-9965-4746",,,"[Anonymous], 2014, E02PE ENG COUNC S A; Barry N, 2012, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V44, P28; Bussy BR, 2017, P 25 SO AFR U POW EN, P12; Cazacu E, 2006, REV ROUMAINE SCI TEC, V51, P27; Branco PJC, 2010, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V47, P380, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.47.4.; Earnshaw S., 1839, SOC, V7, P9; LAITHWAITE ER, 1965, P I ELECTR ENG, V112, P2361, DOI 10.1049/piee.1965.039; LeeKim HK, 2006, IEEE T MAGN, V42, P191; Liu HJ, 2017, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V54, P341, DOI 10.1177/002072091769465; Meeker D.C., 2006, FINITE ELEMENT METH; Oka K, 1996, ELECT ENG JPN, V116, P29; Riba JR, 2017, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V54, P35, DOI 10.1177/002072091665950; Santisteban JA, 2012, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V44, P23; Suresh S, 2015, INT INNOVAT RES J EN, V1, P1; Thompson MT, 2000, IEEE POTENTIALS, V19, P40, DOI 10.1109/45.82564",15,4,4,1,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The proposed educational method combines theoretical, simulation and experimental approaches with the purpose of a higher-level knowledge achievement. Several exercises have been defined and implemented in the teaching process. Some characteristic overhead transmission line steady state regimes, such as Ferranti effect, natural load flow and capacitive overhead transmission line behaviour, have been analysed. The special analysis has been carried out in order to determine the basic characteristics of the switching transients. Software package MATLAB/Simulink has been used for the estimation of system parameters and for the simulation analysis. Different overhead transmission line models have been compared and useful modelling guidelines have been recommended. Experimental calculations have been performed by using a physically scaled system consisting of multiple Pi sections representing 100 km length 400 kV overhead transmission line. The proposed method has been tested within High Voltage Engineering undergraduate course and useful application feedback from students has been obtained.","[Forcan, Miodrag] Univ Belgrade, Fac Elect Engn, Belgrade, Serbia; [Forcan, Miodrag; Banjanin, Mladen; Vukovic, Goran] Univ East Sarajevo, Fac Elect Engn, East Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg","Forcan, M (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Sch Elect Engn, Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra 73, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",miodrag.forcan@etf.unssa.rs.ba,"Banjanin, Mladen Svetozar/AAD-9818-2019; Forcan, Miodrag/AAZ-7502-2021","Banjanin, Mladen/0000-0002-9797-5386",,,"[Anonymous], 2004, 600714 IE; [Anonymous], MATLAB SI; [Anonymous], 1998, PESTR7 IEE; Banjanin M, 2015, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V52, P340, DOI 10.1177/002072091558810; Bergen A, 2000, POWER SYSTEMS ANAL, P4; Canadian-American EMTP User Group, 2011, ATP RUL BOO; CIGRE, 1990, GUID REPR NETW EL C; DIgSILENT, VERS 14 0 52; Hileman A., 1999, INSULATION COORDINA; Kiessling F, 2014, OVERHEAD POWER LINES, P2; Seyedi H, 2013, IET GENER TRANSM DIS, V7, P218, DOI 10.1049/iet-gtd.2012.028; Shahnia F, 2016, IEEE T EDUC, V59, P81, DOI 10.1109/TE.2015.244861; Shenkman A., 2005, TRANSIENT ANAL ELECT, P32; Tleis N., 2008, POWER SYSTEMS MODELL, P3; Vahidi B, 2010, INT J ENG EDUC, V26, P135; Wood R.J.C., 1925, Journal of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, V44, P121; Yuan J., 2011, IEEE T POWER DELIV, V27, P112, DOI [10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2172696, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2172696",17,4,4,1,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The educational tool comprises a graphical user interface in MATLAB. The graphical user interface permits an individual to investigate various parameters involved in the design of the required compensator, which includes percentage overshoot, peak time, and velocity error constant and observe the results dynamically as the parameters change. The approach used in this article for the design of compensators is based on the frequency response analysis. One can obtain various plots including unit step response plot, Bode plot, and root locus plot for uncompensated and compensated systems to have a better understanding of the designed compensator.","[Yadav, Drishti; Patel, R.
