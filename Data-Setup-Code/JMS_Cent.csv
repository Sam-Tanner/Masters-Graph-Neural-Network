Although, research on AD has increased in recent years, however, the complexity associated with brain structure and functions makes the early diagnosis of this disease a challenging task. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a neuroimaging technology that has been widely used to study the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In literature, the computer-aided diagnosis of AD is limited to binary classification or diagnosis of AD and MCI stages. However, its applicability to diagnose multiple progressive stages of AD is relatively under-studied. This study explores the effectiveness of rs-fMRI for multi-class classification of AD and its associated stages including CN, SMC, EMCI, MCI, LMCI, and AD. A longitudinal cohort of resting-state fMRI of 138 subjects (25 CN, 25 SMC, 25 EMCI, 25 LMCI, 13 MCI, and 25 AD) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is studied. To provide a better insight into deep learning approaches and their applications to AD classification, we investigate ResNet-18 architecture in detail. We consider the training of the network from scratch by using single-channel input as well as performed transfer learning with and without fine-tuning using an extended network architecture. We experimented with residual neural networks to perform AD classification task and compared it with former research in this domain. The performance of the models is evaluated using precision, recall, f1-measure, AUC and ROC curves. We found that our networks were able to significantly classify the subjects. We achieved improved results with our fine-tuned model for all the AD stages with an accuracy of 100%, 96.85%, 97.38%, 97.43%, 97.40% and 98.01% for CN, SMC, EMCI, LMCI, MCI, and AD respectively. However, in terms of overall performance, we achieved state-of-the-art results with an average accuracy of 97.92% and 97.88% for off-the-shelf and fine-tuned models respectively. The Analysis of results indicate that classification and prediction of neurodegenerative brain disorders such as AD using functional magnetic resonance imaging and advanced deep learning methods is promising for clinical decision making and have the potential to assist in early diagnosis of AD and its associated stages.","[Ramzan, Farheen; Khan, Muhammad Usman Ghani; Rehmat, Asim; Iqbal, Sajid] UET, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Lahore, Pakistan; [Iqbal, Sajid] Bahauddin Zakariya Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Multan, Pakistan; [Saba, Tanzila; Rehman, Amjad] Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia; [Mehmood, Zahid] Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Engn, Taxila 47050, Pakistan","Iqbal, S (corresponding author), UET, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Lahore, Pakistan.;Iqbal, S (corresponding author), Bahauddin Zakariya Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Multan, Pakistan.",sajid.iqbal@bzu.edu.pk,"Iqbal, Sajid/AAS-8369-2020; Mehmood, Zahid/S-1709-2018; Saba, Tanzila/D-4593-2018","Mehmood, Zahid/0000-0003-4888-2594; Saba, Tanzila/0000-0003-3138-3801; iqbal, sajid/0000-0002-8464-2275","HEC Pakistan [NRPU-4223]; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (National Institutes of Health) [U01 AG024904]; DOD ADNI (Department of Defense) [W81XWH-12-2-0012]; National Institute on Aging; AbbVie; Alzheimer's Association; Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation; Araclon Biotech; BioClinica, Inc.; Biogen; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; CereSpir, Inc.; Cogstate; Eisai Inc.; Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Eli Lilly and Company; EuroImmun; Fujirebio; GE Healthcare; IXICO Ltd.; Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research & Development, LLC.; Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development LLC.; Lumosity; Lundbeck; Merck Co., Inc.; Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC.; NeuroRx Research; Neurotrack Technologies; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation; Pfizer Inc.; Piramal Imaging; Servier; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company; Transition Therapeutics; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) Lab Prince Sultan University Riyadh Saudi Arabia; F.

In this manuscript, a deep learning model is deployed to predict input slices as a tumor (unhealthy)/non-tumor (healthy). This manuscript employs a high pass filter image to prominent the inhomogeneities field effect of the MR slices and fused with the input slices. Moreover, the median filter is applied to the fused slices. The resultant slices quality is improved with smoothen and highlighted edges of the input slices. After that, based on these slices' intensity, a 4-connected seed growing algorithm is applied, where optimal threshold clusters the similar pixels from the input slices. The segmented slices are then supplied to the fine-tuned two layers proposed stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) model. The hyperparameters of the model are selected after extensive experiments. At the first layer, 200 hidden units and at the second layer 400 hidden units are utilized. The testing is performed on the softmax layer for the prediction of the images having tumors and no tumors. The suggested model is trained and checked on BRATS datasets i.e., 2012(challenge and synthetic), 2013, and 2013 Leaderboard, 2014, and 2015 datasets.

Time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) methodology identifies cost drivers and reduces inaccurate costing based on siloed budgets. Inaccurate costing also results from the fact that current costing methods use charges and there has been tremendous cost shifting throughout health care. High cost, high variability processes can be identified for process improvement. As payment models inevitably evolve towards value-based metrics, it will be critical to knowledgably participate in the coordination of these changes. This document provides 8 practical Recommendations from the Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) aimed at outlining the principles of TDABC, creating process maps for patient workflows, understanding payment structures, establishing physician alignment across service lines to create integrated practice units to facilitate development of evidence-based pathways for specific patient risk groups, establishing consistent care delivery, minimizing variability between physicians and departments, utilizing data analytics and information technology tools to track progress and obtain actionable data, and using TDABC to create costing transparency.","[Allin, Olivia] Harvard Univ, Harvard Coll, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Urman, Richard D.; Bader, Angela M.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Surg & Publ Hlth, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Urman, Richard D.; Bader, Angela M.] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, 75 Francis St CWN L1, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Edwards, Angela F.] Wake Forest Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Winston Salem, NC 27101 USA; [Blitz, Jeanna D.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Pfeifer, Kurt J.] Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Med, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Feeley, Thomas W.] Harvard Univ, Harvard Business Sch, Inst Strategy & Competitiveness, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Urman, RD (corresponding author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Surg & Publ Hlth, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Urman, RD (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, 75 Francis St CWN L1, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",rurman@bwh.harvard.edu,"Urman, Richard/ABG-4830-2020","Urman, Richard/0000-0002-0516-5977",,,"Akhavan S, 2016, CLIN ORTHOP RELAT R, V474, P8, DOI 10.1007/s11999-015-4214-; Aronson S, 2018, ANESTH ANALG, V126, P682, DOI 10.1213/ANE.000000000000260; Azoulay Arik, 2007, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, V5, P11, DOI 10.1186/1478-7547-5-1; Berwick DM, 2008, HEALTH AFFAIR, V27, P759, DOI 10.1377/hlthaff.27.3.75; Boston Consulting Group, 2018, DUTCH HOSP MAK VAL ; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, COMPR CAR JOINT REP; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, US HLTH CAR SPEND R; Dalci I, 2010, INT J CONTEMP HOSP M, V22, P609, DOI 10.1108/0959611101105377; Feeley TW, 2010, J HEALTHC MANAG, V55, P399, DOI 10.1097/00115514-201011000-0000; French KE, 2016, HEALTHCARE-J DEL SCI, V4, P173, DOI 10.1016/j.hjdsi.2015.08.00; French KE, 2013, HEALTHCARE-J DEL SCI, V1, P136, DOI 10.1016/j.hjdsi.2013.07.00; Kaplan R.

Reichertz is one of the most significant pioneers in the field of medical informatics worldwide. In 1969, 50 years ago, he became Professor at the Hannover Medical School. On the occasion of this anniversary an attempt was made to report on the scientific work of Peter Reichertz and to reflect on this work in the light of medical informatics knowledge today. The aim of this study was to search publications listings in the Peter L. Reichertz Archive, in Pubmed/Medline, and in the Web of Science. As well as to analyse contents and communication approaches to help in classifying Peter Reichertz's scientific publications. Three comprehensive publication lists were identified: the Print Bibliography (384 publications), the Disc Bibliography (285 publications) and the Selected Publications Bibliography (111 publications). Based on the last bibliography, a classification was built along the semantic dimensions of (1) major topics, (2) fields of publication, and (3) publication languages. Major contents of Peter Reichertz's research in informatics were medical informatics as a field (including education), informatics applications in medicine and health care, and health information systems. Clear shifts over time were observed. To his research on informatics applications, in the 1970s health information systems was added as topic, which then became a major part of his research. While in the 1960s and earlier German was a major publication language, from the 1970s onwards this shifted to English as the major language. Peter Reichertz very early identified the potential of computers in medicine and health care. He did not just use information and communication technology and information processing methodology as if they were other technology, such as microscopes or ultrasonic devices, for improving diagnosis and therapy. He was visionary enough to very early see the revolutionary potential of informatics for biomedicine and health care, with consequential impact on research and education.","[Haux, Reinhold] TU Braunschweig, Peter L Reichertz Inst Med Informat, Muehlenpfordtstr 23, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [Haux, Reinhold] Hannover Med Sch, Muehlenpfordtstr 23, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany","Haux, R (corresponding author), TU Braunschweig, Peter L Reichertz Inst Med Informat, Muehlenpfordtstr 23, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany.;Haux, R (corresponding author), Hannover Med Sch, Muehlenpfordtstr 23, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany.",Reinhold.Haux@plri.de,,"Haux, Reinhold/0000-0001-5376-8660",,,"Brigl B, 2005, INT J MED INFORM, V74, P51, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2004.09.00; Demiris G, 2011, Yearb Med Inform, V6, P5; Elkin PL, 2013, METHOD INFORM MED, V52, P538, DOI 10.3414/ME13-01-004; Gehring S, 2018, METHOD INFORM MED, V57, pE46, DOI 10.3414/ME18-13-000; Gulkesen KH, 2019, METHOD INFORM MED, V58, pE1, DOI 10.1055/s-0039-168110; Gulkesen KH, 2019, METHODS INF ME; Haarbrandt B, 2018, METHOD INFORM MED, V57, pE66, DOI 10.3414/ME18-02-000; Haux R, 2000, METHOD INFORM MED, V39, P26; Haux R, 2016, Yearb Med Inform, VSuppl 1, pS76, DOI 10.15265/IYS-2016-s00; Haux R, 2014, Yearb Med Inform, V9, P255, DOI 10.15265/IY-2014-002; Haux R, 2006, INT J MED INFORM, V75, P268, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2005.08.00; Haux R, 2012, LECT NOTES INFORM, P9; Haux R, 2017, METHOD INFORM MED, V56, pE1, DOI 10.3414/ME16-01-012; Haux R, 2010, INT J MED INFORM, V79, P599, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2010.06.00; Holmes John H, 2018, Yearb Med Inform, V27, P5, DOI 10.1055/s-0038-164121; Kuhn KA, 2001, METHOD INFORM MED, V40, P27; Lyu PH, 2015, INFORM HEALTH SOC CA, V40, P210, DOI 10.3109/17538157.2014.89249; Mantas J, 2010, METHOD INFORM MED, V49, P105, DOI 10.3414/ME511; Maojo V, 2012, METHOD INFORM MED, V51, P131, DOI 10.3414/ME11-01-006; Maojo V, 2012, METHOD INFORM MED, V51, P82, DOI 10.3414/ME11-01-006; McCray AT, 2011, METHOD INFORM MED, V50, P491, DOI 10.3414/ME11-06-000; Moehr J R, 2004, Yearb Med Inform, P20; ORTHNER H, 1987, COMPUT METH PROG BIO, V25, P69, DOI 10.1016/0169-2607(87)90041-; Peter L, 2019, REICHERTZ I MED INF; Prasser F, 2018, METHOD INFORM MED, V57, pE57, DOI 10.3414/ME17-02-002; Prokosch HU, 2018, METHOD INFORM MED, V57, pE82, DOI 10.3414/ME17-02-002; Reichertz P, 1965, DEUT MED WOCHENSCHR, V19, P34; Reichertz P, 1966, Z ARZTL FORTBILD, V55, P32; Reichertz PL, 2006, INT J MED INFORM, V75, P282, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2005.10.00; REICHERTZ PL, 1987, COMPUT METH PROG BIO, V25, P89, DOI 10.1016/0169-2607(87)90044-; REICHERTZ PL, 1980, METHOD INFORM MED, V19, P1; REICHERTZ PL, 1977, METHOD INFORM MED, V16, P12; Reichertz PL, 1981, KONZEPTE MED I UNPU; Reichertz PL, 2004, YB MED INFORM, P21; Reichertz PL, CURRICULUM VITA; Reichertz PL, 1973, PROTOKOLL KLAU UNPU; Rienhoff O., 1988, 33 ANN M GMDS EFMI ; Schuemie MJ, 2009, METHOD INFORM MED, V48, P76, DOI 10.3414/ME057; Semler SC, 2018, METHOD INFORM MED, V57, pE50, DOI 10.3414/ME18-03-000; Teilhard de Chardin P, 1949, PLACE HOMME NATUR; TEMPLETON AW, 1969, RADIOLOGY, V92, P30, DOI 10.1148/92.1.3; TIEMANN F, 1959, MED EXP, V1, P1; van Bemmel JH, DECISION SUPPORT MED, P; WAGNER GA, 1987, METHOD INFORM MED, V26, P17; Wang LQ, 2017, STUD HEALTH TECHNOL, V245, P968, DOI 10.3233/978-1-61499-830-3-96; Winter A, 2018, METHOD INFORM MED, V57, pE92, DOI 10.3414/ME18-02-000; ZIPF HF, 1957, N-S ARCH EX PATH PH, V231, P9",47,0,0,1,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The objective of this study was to explore patients' perspectives on the usability of this self-management app. A mixed-methods study design was implemented. The app was trialed at a local rehabilitation centre with 20 inpatient participants who experienced a SCI. They received mobile app training sessions throughout their inpatient rehabilitation. A thematic analysis was performed on qualitative data from post-discharge exit questionnaires and researchers' field notes. Quantitative data (in the form of participants' tool usage data and self-reported system usability scale scores) were collected at discharge and 3 months post-discharge. Three main themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: (1) being accessible to users (i.e., being easy to adopt and compatible with assistive technologies), (2) being intuitive to navigate (i.e., incorporating a simple app layout and a system of alert notifications), and (3) offering users flexibility (i.e., providing users with control over their data). The mobile app received above average mean system usability scale scores, both at discharge (78.1/100) and 3 months post-discharge (71.6/100). Given that participants found the app acceptable for use in inpatient rehabilitation and following discharge into the community, further testing is warranted to explore its efficacy in preventing secondary complications.","[Singh, Gurkaran; MacGillivray, Megan; Sawatzky, Bonita; Mortenson, W.

Studies conducted on adult (>= 18 years) patients between 2015 and February 2019 were deemed eligible. A total of 19 papers were included. Our review suggests that the use of Machine Learning (ML) in the field of OR organization has many potentials. Predictions of the surgical case duration were obtain with a good performance; their use could therefore allow a more precise scheduling, limiting waste of resources. ML is able to support even more complex models, which can coordinate multiple spaces simultaneously, as in the case of the post-anesthesia care unit and operating rooms. Types of Artificial Intelligence could also be used to limit another organizational problem, which has important economic repercussions: cancellation. Random Forest has proven effective in identifing surgeries with high risks of cancellation, allowing to plan preventive measures to reduce the cancellation rate accordingly. In conclusion, although data in literature are still limited, we believe that ML has great potential in the field of OR organization; however, further studies are needed to assess the effective role of these new technologies in the perioperative medicine.","[Bellini, Valentina; Bignami, Elena] Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Anesthesiol Crit Care & Pain Med Div, Viale Gramsci 14, I-43126 Parma, Italy; [Guzzon, Marco; Bigliardi, Barbara; Mordonini, Monica; Filippelli, Serena] Dept Engn & Architecture, Parco Area Sci 181-A, I-43124 Parma, Italy","Bignami, E (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Anesthesiol Crit Care & Pain Med Div, Viale Gramsci 14, I-43126 Parma, Italy.",elenagiovanna.bignami@unipr.it,,,,,"Albala D, 2019, UROLOGY, V124, P198, DOI 10.1016/j.urology.2018.09.03; Bellini V, 2019, J MED SYST, V43, DOI 10.1007/s10916-019-1178-; Bignami E, 2019, ANESTH ANALG, V128, pE30, DOI 10.1213/ANE.000000000000389; Childers CP, 2018, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V320, P835, DOI 10.1001/jama.2018.921; Christodoulou E, 2019, J CLIN EPIDEMIOL, V110, P12, DOI 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2019.02.00; Cobb AN, 2018, J SURG RES, V232, P308, DOI 10.1016/j.jss.2018.06.04; Edelman ER, 2017, FRONT MED-LAUSANNE, V4, DOI 10.3389/fmed.2017.0008; Eschenfeldt PC, 2018, PLOS ONE, V13, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.019924; Fairley M, 2019, HEALTH CARE MANAG SC, V22, P756, DOI 10.1007/s10729-018-9457-; Fong AJ, 2016, J SURG RES, V204, P371, DOI 10.1016/j.jss.2016.04.05; Ghezzi TL, 2016, WORLD J SURG, V40, P2550, DOI 10.1007/s00268-016-3543-; Hadjerci O, 2016, EXPERT SYST APPL, V61, P64, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2016.05.00; Harvin JA, 2019, J AM COLL SURGEONS, V228, P255, DOI 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2018.12.02; Healey T, 2015, JBJS REV, V3, P1; Hernandez-Meza G, 2018, J CLIN MONIT COMPUT, V32, P147, DOI 10.1007/s10877-017-9998-; Hernandez-Meza G, 2017, NEUROPHOTONICS, V4, DOI 10.1117/1.NPh.4.4.04140; Hollon TC, 2018, NEUROSURG FOCUS, V45, DOI 10.3171/2018.8.FOCUS1826; Khorgami Z, 2019, SURG ENDOSC, V33, P2217, DOI 10.1007/s00464-018-6507-; Lee CH, 2017, KIDNEY RES CLIN PRAC, V36, P3, DOI 10.23876/j.krcp.2017.36.1.; Luo L, 2020, HEALTH INFORM J, V26, P141, DOI 10.1177/146045821881360; Maimaiti N, 2016, ETHIOP J HEALTH DEV, V30, P9; Moccia S, 2018, INT J COMPUT ASS RAD, V13, P1357, DOI 10.1007/s11548-018-1787-; Moustafa MA, 2017, EGYPT J ANAESTH, V33, P153, DOI 10.1016/j.egja.2017.02.00; Obermeyer Z, 2016, NEW ENGL J MED, V375, P1216, DOI 10.1056/NEJMp160618; Pesteie M, 2018, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V37, P81, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2017.273911; Rajkomar A, 2019, NEW ENGL J MED, V380, P1347, DOI 10.1056/NEJMra181425; Rothstein DH, 2018, SEMIN PEDIATR SURG, V27, P79, DOI 10.1053/j.sempedsurg.2018.02.00; Sahu M., 2016, INT J MECH ENG ROBOT, V; Shahabikargar Z, 2017, STUD HEALTH TECHNOL, V239, P133, DOI 10.3233/978-1-61499-783-2-13; Sidey-Gibbons JAM, 2019, BMC MED RES METHODOL, V19, DOI 10.1186/s12874-019-0681-; Sobrie O, 2016, COMPUT METH PROG BIO, V133, P183, DOI 10.1016/j.cmpb.2016.05.02; Stepaniak PS, 2009, ANESTH ANALG, V109, P1232, DOI 10.1213/ANE.0b013e3181b5de0; Suzuki S, 2019, PLOS ONE, V14, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.022191; Tuwatananurak JP, 2019, J MED SYST, V43, DOI 10.1007/s10916-019-1160-; Wu HL, 2015, PLOS ONE, V10, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.013483; Xie SC, 2018, PHARMACOGENOMICS, V19, P1111, DOI 10.2217/pgs-2018-008; Zhao BQ, 2019, J MED SYST, V43, DOI 10.1007/s10916-018-1151-",37,15,16,7,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Thus, it is necessary to enhance the accessibility of EHR by improving the user experience (UX). To apply information visualization that turns EHR data into an understandable visual format, we propose following five screen design principles when designing UX interfaces. #1: One view should contain single patient data. #2: Data should be summarized or titled for overview and details should be given on-demand. #3: Data should be displayed in time-series. #4: Data should be categorized by primary type. #5: More data should be displayed at the same time. Three screen designs are plausible utilizing the above-mentioned principles. To measure the UX of screen designs and validate the design principles, we built an EHR viewer system that has three windows corresponding to these screen designs and had it tested by medical staff. The results of the test revealed that the UX of the screen design is proportional to the number of design principles that the screen design incorporates. It shows that the proposed screen design principles improve the UX of EHR.","[Fujita, Kenichiro; Takemura, Tadamasa] Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Appl Informat, Chuo Ku, 7-1-28 Minatojima Minamimachi, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Onishi, Katsumi] Osaka City Univ, Media Ctr, Sumiyoshi Ku, 3-3-138 Sugimotocho, Osaka 5588585, Japan; [Kuroda, Tomohiro] Kyoto Univ Hosp, Sakyo Ku, 54 Kawaharacho, Kyoto 6068507, Japan","Fujita, K (corresponding author), Univ Hyogo, Grad Sch Appl Informat, Chuo Ku, 7-1-28 Minatojima Minamimachi, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan.",fujita.kenichiroh.6c@kyoto-u.jp,,"Fujita, Kenichiro/0000-0002-9806-3477",,,"Anders S, 2012, INT J MED INFORM, V81, P842, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2012.04.00; [Anonymous], 1957, RUL PROF CHARG HEAL; Chen M., 2016, INFORM THEORY TOOL; Evans R S, 2016, Yearb Med Inform, VSuppl 1, pS48, DOI 10.15265/IYS-2016-s00; Faiola A., 2011, P INT C HUM COMP INT, P11; Hayrinen K, 2008, INT J MED INFORM, V77, P291, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2007.09.00; Klimov D, 2010, J INTELL INF SYST, V35, P261, DOI 10.1007/s10844-009-0100-; Koppel R, 2005, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V293, P1197, DOI 10.1001/jama.293.10.119; Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare, 2013, SEC GUID HLTH INF SY, P9; Ordonez P., 2010, P 1 ACM INT HLTH INF, P77; Plaisant C., 1996, Human Factors in Computing Systems.

HLNR was lower in patients with high pathologic stage, high Fuhrman nuclear grade and accompanying tumor necrosis positiveness. There was a negative correlation between pathologic stage, Fuhrman nuclear grade and tumor necrosis with HLPR. P values are 0.001, 0.014 and 0.047 respectively. HLPR was lower in patients with high pathologic stage, high Fuhrman nuclear grade and accompanying tumor necrosis positiveness. High pathological stage, high Fuhrman nuclear grade and existence of tumor necrosis are associates with preoperative low HLNR and low HLPR in renal cell carcinoma patients. They can be used as prognostic markers in patients with renal mass preoperatively.","[Ucar, Murat; Akkoc, Ali; Topcuoglu, Murat] Alanya Alaaddin Keykubat Univ, Sch Med, Antalya, Turkey; [Soyupek, Sedat; Oksay, Taylan; Ozorak, Alper; Demir, Murat; Kosar, Alim] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Sch Med, Isparta, Turkey","Ucar, M (corresponding author), Alanya Alaaddin Keykubat Univ, Sch Med, Antalya, Turkey.",murat.ucar@alanya.edu.tr,"ozorak, alper/AAA-5716-2021",,,,"Azab B, 2012, RENAL FAILURE, V34, P571, DOI 10.3109/0886022X.2012.66874; Azab B, 2012, ANN SURG ONCOL, V19, P217, DOI 10.1245/s10434-011-1814-; Bazzi WM, 2016, CAN J UROL, V23, P815; de Martino M, 2015, BJU INT, V115, P397, DOI 10.1111/bju.1276; de Martino M, 2013, BJU INT, V111, pE348, DOI 10.1111/bju.1206; de Martino M, 2012, CANCER-AM CANCER SOC, V118, P82, DOI 10.1002/cncr.2625; Frank I, 2002, J UROLOGY, V168, P2395, DOI 10.1016/S0022-5347(05)64153-; Hofbauer SL, 2014, BRIT J CANCER, V111, P1526, DOI 10.1038/bjc.2014.45; Hutterer GC, 2015, ANTICANCER RES, V35, P346; Ikuerowo SO, 2019, NIGER J CLIN PRACT, V22, P1271, DOI 10.4103/njcp.njcp_35_1; Kao SCH, 2010, CLIN CANCER RES, V16, P5805, DOI 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-224; Keizman D, 2012, EUR J CANCER, V48, P202, DOI 10.1016/j.ejca.2011.09.00; Kishi Y, 2009, ANN SURG ONCOL, V16, P614, DOI 10.1245/s10434-008-0267-; Klatte T, 2009, CANCER EPIDEM BIOMAR, V18, P894, DOI 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-08-078; Leibovich BC, 2003, CANCER-AM CANCER SOC, V97, P1663, DOI 10.1002/cncr.1123; Leibovich BC, 2010, J UROLOGY, V183, P1309, DOI 10.1016/j.juro.2009.12.03; Lucca I, 2015, WORLD J UROL, V33, P2045, DOI 10.1007/s00345-015-1559-; Mandal SK, 2015, J CANCER RES THER, V11, DOI 10.4103/0973-1482.13938; Mano R., 2019, UROL ONCOL SEMINAR; Mantovani A, 2008, NATURE, V454, P436, DOI 10.1038/nature0720; Muijs D, 2010, BIVARIATE ANAL COMP, P12; Pichler M, 2013, BRIT J CANCER, V108, P901, DOI 10.1038/bjc.2013.2; Rhodes EC, 2014, PEDIATR SURG INT, V30, P243, DOI 10.1007/s00383-013-3321-; Siegel RL, 2019, CA-CANCER J CLIN, V69, P7, DOI 10.3322/caac.2155; Sobin LH., 2011, TNM CLASSIFICATION ; Sun M, 2011, EUR UROL, V60, P644, DOI 10.1016/j.eururo.2011.06.04; Sureka B, 2014, J CANCER RES THER, V10, P552, DOI 10.4103/0973-1482.13792; Xia LL, 2017, ANTICANCER RES, V37, P3175, DOI 10.21873/anticanres.1167; Yodying H, 2016, ANN SURG ONCOL, V23, P646, DOI 10.1245/s10434-015-4869-; Zisman A, 2002, J CLIN ONCOL, V20, P4559, DOI 10.1200/JCO.2002.05.11",30,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

This longitudinal, retrospective study enrolled 88 high-risk patients and had a follow-up time of 12.4 years. We collected clinical and laboratory data, as well as information on arterial stiffness parameters using arterial tonometry and measurements from ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. We considered nonfatal, incident cardiovascular events as the primary outcome. Given the small size of our dataset, we used survival analysis (i.e., Cox proportional hazards model) combined with a machine learning-based algorithm/penalization method to evaluate the data. Our predictive model, calculated with Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), included body mass index, diabetes mellitus, gender (male), and PWV. We recorded 16 nonfatal cardiovascular events (5 myocardial infarctions, 5 episodes of heart failure, and 6 strokes). The adjusted hazard ratio for PWV was 1.199 (95% confidence interval: 1.09-1.37, p < 0.001). Arterial stiffness was a predictor of cardiovascular disease development, as determined by PWV in a high-risk population. Thus, in obese, hypertensive, hyperglycemic patients with preserved kidney function, PWV can serve as a prognostic factor for major adverse cardiac events.","[Garcia-Carretero, Rafael; Vigil-Medina, Luis] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Mostoles Univ Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Mostoles, Spain; [Barquero-Perez, Oscar; Ramos-Lopez, Javier] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Signal Theory & Commun & Telemat Syst & Comp, Mostoles, Spain","Garcia-Carretero, R (corresponding author), Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Mostoles Univ Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Mostoles, Spain.",rgcarretero@salud.madrid.org; luis.vigil@salud.madrid.org; oscar.barquero@urjc.es; javier.ramos@urjc.es,"Garcia-Carretero, Rafael/E-1935-2015","Garcia-Carretero, Rafael/0000-0001-7532-4585",,,"Ambler G, 2012, STAT MED, V31, P1150, DOI 10.1002/sim.437; Amer Diabet Assoc, 2018, DIABETES CARE, V41, pS13, DOI 10.2337/dc18-S00; Babiska M, 2015, STUD LOGIC GRAMM RHE, V43, P33, DOI [10.1515/slgr-2015-0040, DOI 10.1515/SLGR-2015-0040; Ben-Shlomo Y, 2014, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V63, P636, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2013.09.06; Benner A, 2010, BIOMETRICAL J, V52, P50, DOI 10.1002/bimj.20090006; Cleeman JI, 2001, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V285, P2486, DOI 10.1001/jama.285.19.248; Collins GS, 2015, J CLIN EPIDEMIOL, V68, P112, DOI [10.1016/j.jclinepi.2014.11.010, 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.014508, 10.1186/s12916-014-0241-z, 10.1002/bjs.9736, 10.7326/M14-0697, 10.1136/bmj.g7594; Concato J, 1995, J CLIN EPIDEMIOL, V48, P1495, DOI 10.1016/0895-4356(95)00510-; Core Team R, 2021, R LANG ENV STAT COM; Cruickshank K, 2002, CIRCULATION, V106, P2085, DOI 10.1161/01.CIR.0000033824.02722.F; Goeman JJ, 2010, BIOMETRICAL J, V52, P70, DOI 10.1002/bimj.20090002; Hansen TW, 2006, CIRCULATION, V113, P664, DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.57934; James G., 2013, SPRINGER TEXTS STAT, DOI [10.1007/978-1-4614-7138-7, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-7138-7; KHUNTI K, 2010, BMJ-BRIT MED J, V342, P6312, DOI DOI 10.1136/BMJ.C631; Kohavi R., 1995, IJCA; Koumaras C, 2014, J AM SOC HYPERTENS, V8, P74, DOI 10.1016/j.jash.2013.09.00; Kramer H, 2005, HYPERTENSION, V46, P38, DOI 10.1161/01.HYP.0000171189.48911.1; Levey AS, 2009, ANN INTERN MED, V150, P604, DOI 10.7326/0003-4819-150-9-200905050-0000; Lewington S, 2002, LANCET, V360, P1903, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)11911-; Mann JFE, 2004, KIDNEY INT, V66, pS59, DOI 10.1111/j.1523-1755.2004.09215.; O'Brien E, 2010, BLOOD PRESS MONIT, V15, P171, DOI 10.1097/MBP.0b013e32833b7c0; Ojeda FM, 2016, GENOM PROTEOM BIOINF, V14, P235, DOI 10.1016/j.gpb.2016.03.00; Oliveras A, 2013, J HYPERTENS, V31, P103, DOI 10.1097/HJH.0b013e32835ac7b; Pavlou M, 2015, BMJ-BRIT MED J, V351, DOI 10.1136/bmj.h386; Payne RA, 2010, HYPERTENSION, V55, P9, DOI 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.107.09046; Scuteri A, 2012, ATHEROSCLEROSIS, V221, P189, DOI 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.11.04; Simon N, 2011, J STAT SOFTW, V39, P; Sowa JP, 2014, PLOS ONE, V9, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.010144; Sowa JP, 2013, PLOS ONE, V8, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.006243; Sutton-Tyrrell K, 2005, CIRCULATION, V111, P3384, DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.104.48362; Tang J, 2014, DATA CLASSIF ALGORIT, V3; Tibshirani R, 1997, STAT MED, V16, P385, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19970228)16:4<385::AID-SIM380>3.0.CO;2-; Townsend RR, 2010, AM J HYPERTENS, V23, P282, DOI 10.1038/ajh.2009.24; Van Bortel LM, 2012, J HYPERTENS, V30, P445, DOI 10.1097/HJH.0b013e32834fa8b; Wang KL, 2009, J HYPERTENS, V27, P461, DOI 10.1097/HJH.0b013e3283220ea; Wiener M, 2002, MACH LEARN, V2, P18, DOI DOI 10.1023/A:101093340432; Williams B, 2018, EUR HEART J, V39, P3021, DOI 10.1093/eurheartj/ehy33; Zhang LF, 2018, KIDNEY BLOOD PRESS R, V43, P1375, DOI 10.1159/00049295",38,10,10,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The structure and shape of the organ, combined with morphological measurements such as volume and curvature, can provide significant guidance towards establishing progression or severity of a condition, and thus support improved diagnosis and therapy planning. Furthermore, the classification and stratification of organ abnormalities aim to explore and investigate organ deformations following injury, trauma and illness. This paper presents a framework for automatic morphological feature extraction in computer-aided 3D organ reconstructions following organ segmentation in 3D radiological scans. Two different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets are evaluated. Using the MRI scans of 85 adult volunteers, the overall mean volume for the pancreas organ is 69.30 +/- 32.50cm(3), and the 3D global curvature is (35.23 +/- 6.83) x 10(-3). Another experiment evaluates the MRI scans of 30 volunteers, and achieves mean liver volume of 1547.48 +/- 204.19cm(3) and 3D global curvature (19.87 +/- 3.62) x 10(- 3). Both experiments highlight a negative correlation between 3D curvature and volume with a statistical difference (p < 0.0001). Such a tool can support the investigation into organ related conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and liver disease.","[Asaturyan, Hykoush; Villarini, Barbara] Univ Westminster, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, London, England; [Thomas, E.

Keeping in view its dreadful effect on humans, cancer detection at a premature stage is a more significant requirement to reduce the probability of mortality rate. This manuscript depicts an approach of finding lung nodule at an initial stage that comprises of three major phases: (1) lung nodule segmentation using Otsu threshold followed by morphological operation; (2) extraction of geometrical, texture and deep learning features for selecting optimal features; (3) The optimal features are fused serially for classification of lung nodule into two categories that is malignant and benign. The lung image database consortium image database resource initiative (LIDC-IDRI) is used for experimentation. The experimental outcomes show better performance of presented approach as compared with the existing methods.","[Saba, Tanzila; Sameh, Ahmed; Khan, Fatima] Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia; [Shad, Shafqat Ali] Luther Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Decorah, IA USA; [Sharif, Muhammad] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Comp Sci, Wah Campus, Islamabad, Pakistan","Saba, T (corresponding author), Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia.;Sharif, M (corresponding author), COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Comp Sci, Wah Campus, Islamabad, Pakistan.",tsaba@psu.edu.sa; asameh@psu.edu.sa; fkhan@psu.edu; shadsh01@luther.edu; sharif@ciitwah.edu.pk,"Sharif, Muhammad/AAB-8376-2022; Sharif, Muhammad/ACD-2598-2022; Saba, Tanzila/D-4593-2018","Saba, Tanzila/0000-0003-3138-3801; Shad, Shafqat/0000-0003-0339-1070","Research and Innovation Center [SSP-18-5-03]; Prince Sultan University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; AI & Data Analytics Lab (AIDA), Prince Sultan University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","This work was supported by Research and Innovation Center through grant number SSP-18-5-03; Prince Sultan University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

It is fundamental that patients get actively involved in the management of the disease in their living environments. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the use and acceptance of a self-management system for diabetes developed with User Centered Design Principles in community settings. Persons with diabetes and health professionals were involved the design, development and evaluation of the self-management system; which comprised three iterative cycles: scenario definition, user archetype definition and system development. A comprehensive system was developed integrating modules for the management of blood glucose levels, medication, food intake habits, physical activity, diabetes education and messaging. The system was adapted for two types of principal users (personas): Type 1 Diabetes user and Type 2 Diabetes user. The system was evaluated by assessing the use, the compliance, the attractiveness and perceived usefulness in a multicenter randomized pilot study involving 20 patients and 24 treating professionals for a period of four weeks. Usage and compliance of the co-designed system was compared during the first and the last two weeks of the study, showing a significantly improved behaviour of patients towards the system for each of the modules. This resulted in a successful adoption by both type of personas. Only the medication module showed a significantly different use and compliance (p= 0.01) which can be explained by the different therapeutic course of the two types of diabetes. The involvement of patients to make their own decisions and choices form design stages was key for the adoption of a self-management system for diabetes.","[Fico, Giuseppe; Fioravanti, Alessio; Eugenia Beltran-Jaunsaras, Maria; Teresa Arredondo, Maria] Univ Politecn Madrid, Photon Technol & Bioengn Dept, Life Supporting Technol Grp, Madrid, Spain; [Martinez-Millana, Antonio; Traver, Vicente] Univ Politecn Valencia, ITACA, Valencia, Spain; [Leuteritz, Jan-Paul] Fraunhofer Inst Ind Engn IAO, Ergon & Vehicle Interact, Berlin, Germany","Martinez-Millana, A (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, ITACA, Valencia, Spain.",gfico@lst.tfo.upm.es; anmarmil@itaca.upv.es,"Waldmeyer, María Teresa Arredondo/AAQ-1497-2021; Martinez-Millana, Antonio/O-8012-2015; Fico, Giuseppe/K-3640-2017","Waldmeyer, María Teresa Arredondo/0000-0003-3113-3976; Martinez-Millana, Antonio/0000-0003-1056-5067; Fico, Giuseppe/0000-0003-1551-4613; BELTRAN-JAUNSARAS, MARIA EUGENIA/0000-0002-4219-0055",European Commission [216270.3],This study was funded by European Commission under the 7th Framework Program grant agreement number 216270.3.,"Amer Diabet Assoc, 2008, DIABETES CARE, V31, pS12, DOI 10.2337/dc08-S01; ASLAN S, 2018, 2018 26 SIGN PROC CO, P1, DOI DOI 10.1109/SIU.2018.840482; Barry MJ, 2012, NEW ENGL J MED, V366, P780, DOI 10.1056/NEJMp110928; Bodenheimer T, 2002, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V288, P2469, DOI 10.1001/jama.288.19.246; Chavez S, 2017, DIABETES CARE, V40, pE145, DOI 10.2337/dc17-085; Conte R, 2017, E-HEALTH BIOENG CONF, P321, DOI 10.1109/EHB.2017.799542; DAVIS FD, 1989, MIS QUART, V13, P319, DOI 10.2307/24900; Draznin B, 2013, DIABETES CARE, V36, P1807, DOI 10.2337/dc12-250; Flores AE, 2013, INT CONF BIOMED, P60; Fico G, 2016, IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH, V20, P29, DOI 10.1109/JBHI.2014.236786; Fico G, 2015, IFMBE PROC, V45, P992, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-11128-5_24; Fioravanti A, 2015, MED BIOL ENG COMPUT, V53, P1285, DOI 10.1007/s11517-014-1237-; Gabert R, 2016, PLOS ONE, V11, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.015922; Gomez EI, 2008, IEEE T INF TECHNOL B, V12, P470, DOI 10.1109/TITB.2007.90216; Guillen A, 2011, IEEE ENG MED BIO, P3554, DOI 10.1109/IEMBS.2011.609059; Haas L, 2012, DIABETES CARE, V35, P2393, DOI 10.2337/dc12-170; Hassenzahl M, 2003, MENSCH COMPUTER 2003, P18; Helal Abdelsalam, 2009, J Diabetes Sci Technol, V3, P14; Inzucchi SE, 2015, DIABETES CARE, V38, P140, DOI 10.2337/dc14-244; Irace C, 2017, JMIR MHEALTH UHEALTH, V5, DOI 10.2196/mhealth.853; Martinez-Millana A, 2015, MED BIOL ENG COMPUT, V53, P1295, DOI 10.1007/s11517-015-1245-; Nielsen J., 1990, SIGCHI Bulletin, P24; Nolte E., 2008, INTEGRATION CHRONI; O'Connor AM, 2009, COCHRANE DB SYST REV, DOI [10.1002/14651858.CD001431.pub2, 10.1002/14651858.CD001431.pub4, 10.1002/14651858.CD001431.pub3; Oreskovic Nicolas Michel, 2017, JMIR Med Inform, V5, pe25, DOI 10.2196/medinform.824; Quinn Charlene C, 2014, J Diabetes Sci Technol, V8, P36; Reutens AT, 2012, DIABETES RES CLIN PR, V98, P38, DOI 10.1016/j.diabres.2012.06.00; Ryu B, 2017, J MED INTERNET RES, V19, DOI 10.2196/jmir.886; Salzburg Global Seminar, 2011, BMJ, V342, pd1745, DOI 10.1136/bmj.d174; Shahar Y, 2006, ARTIF INTELL MED, V38, P115, DOI 10.1016/j.artmed.2005.03.00; Synnott J, 2012, IEEE ENG MED BIO, P5819, DOI 10.1109/EMBC.2012.634731; Zarkogianni K, 2015, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V62, P2735, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2015.247052",32,4,4,4,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The tumor contains a cluster of abnormal cells grouped around the inner portion of human brain. It affects the brain by squeezing/ damaging healthy tissues. It also amplifies intra cranial pressure and as a result tumor cells growth increases rapidly which may lead to death. It is, therefore desirable to diagnose/ detect brain tumor at an early stage that may increase the patient survival rate. The major objective of this research work is to present a new technique for the detection of tumor. The proposed architecture accurately segments and classifies the benign and malignant tumor cases. Different spatial domain methods are applied to enhance and accurately segment the input images. Moreover Alex and Google networks are utilized for classification in which two score vectors are obtained after the softmax layer. Further, both score vectors are fused and supplied to multiple classifiers along with softmax layer. Evaluation of proposed model is done on top medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention (MICCAI) challenge datasets i.e., multimodal brain tumor segmentation (BRATS) 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and ischemic stroke lesion segmentation (ISLES) 2018 respectively.","[Amin, Javeria] Univ Wah, Dept Comp Sci, Wah, Pakistan; [Amin, Javeria; Sharif, Muhammad; Yasmin, Mussarat] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Comp Sci, Wah Campus Pakistan, Wah, Pakistan; [Saba, Tanzila] Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia; [Anjum, Muhammad Almas] NUST Pakistan, Coll EME, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Fernandes, Steven Lawrence] Sahyadri Coll Engn & Management, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Mangaluru, India","Amin, J (corresponding author), Univ Wah, Dept Comp Sci, Wah, Pakistan.;Amin, J (corresponding author), COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Comp Sci, Wah Campus Pakistan, Wah, Pakistan.",javeria.amin@uow.edu.pk; muhammadsharifmalik@yahoo.com; mussarat@ciitwah.edu.pk; tsaba@psu.edu.sa; almananjum@yahoo.com; steven.ec@sahyadri.edu.in,"Sharif, Muhammad/AAB-8376-2022; ARSLAN, Okan/AAA-3232-2020; Saba, Tanzila/D-4593-2018; Sharif, Muhammad/ACD-2598-2022","Saba, Tanzila/0000-0003-3138-3801; ",,,"Abdel-Maksoud E, 2015, EGYPT INFORM J, V16, P71, DOI 10.1016/j.eij.2015.01.00; ADAMS R, 1994, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V16, P641, DOI 10.1109/34.29591; Alex K., 2012, ADV NEURAL INFORM P; Amin J, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V87, P290, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.04.06; Amin J, 2017, J COMPUT SCI-NETH, V19, P153, DOI 10.1016/j.jocs.2017.01.00; [Anonymous], [No title captured; [Anonymous], [No title captured; [Anonymous], 2017, PATTERN RECOGN LET; Ansari GJ, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V87, P328, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.04.07; Bauer S, 2013, PHYS MED BIOL, V58, pR97, DOI 10.1088/0031-9155/58/13/R9; Bernal J., 2018, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG; Bhagat PK, 2019, ADV INTELL SYST, V698, P543, DOI 10.1007/978-981-13-1819-1_5; Chen SC, 2019, PATTERN RECOGN, V88, P90, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2018.11.00; Cheng G, 2018, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V27, P281, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2017.276051; Cui ZP, 2016, CHIN CONTR CONF, P7026, DOI 10.1109/ChiCC.2016.755446; Deng WK, 2010, INT CONF BIOMED, P393, DOI 10.1109/BMEI.2010.563953; Dong DC, 2016, MATERIAL ENGINEERING AND MECHANICAL ENGINEERING (MEME2015), P50; Ellwaa A, 2016, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V10154, P129, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-55524-9_1; Gordillo N, 2013, MAGN RESON IMAGING, V31, P1426, DOI 10.1016/j.mri.2013.05.00; Hai JJ, 2019, J HEALTHC ENG, V2019, DOI 10.1155/2019/841548; Han JW, 2018, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V27, P1639, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2017.278142; Havaei M, 2017, MED IMAGE ANAL, V35, P18, DOI 10.1016/j.media.2016.05.00; Isensee F., 2018, NNU NET SELF ADAPTI; Kamnitsas K, 2016, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V10154, P138, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-55524-9_1; Kamnitsas K, 2017, MED IMAGE ANAL, V36, P61, DOI 10.1016/j.media.2016.10.00; Kistler M, 2013, J MED INTERNET RES, V15, DOI 10.2196/jmir.293; Lee CH, 2008, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V5241, P35; Liaqat A, 2018, J MECH MED BIOL, V18, DOI 10.1142/S021951941850038; Maier O, 2017, MED IMAGE ANAL, V35, P250, DOI 10.1016/j.media.2016.07.00; Menze BH, 2015, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V34, P1993, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2014.237769; Menze BH, 2010, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V6362, P15; Naqi SM, 2018, CURR MED IMAGING, V14, P108, DOI 10.2174/157340561366617030611432; Nida N, 2016, IIOAB J, V7, P20; Oliva A, 2016, PLACES IMAGE DATABA; Raja N.

As a crucial application of IoT, telecare medicine information system (TMIS) provides people a high quality of life and advanced level of medical service. In TMIS, smart card-based authenticated key agreement schemes for multi-server architectures have gathered momentum and positive impetus due to the conventional bound of a single server. However, we demonstrate that most of the protocols in the literatures can not implement strong security features in TMIS, such as Lee et al.'s and Shu's scheme. They store the identity information directly, which fail to provide strong anonymity and suffer from password guessing attack. Then we propose an extended authenticated key agreement scheme (short for AKAS) with strong anonymity for multi-server environment in TMIS, by enhancing the security of the correlation parameters stored in the smart cards and calculating patients' dynamic identities. Furthermore, the proposed chaotic map-based scheme provides privacy protection and is formally proved under Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic. At the same, the informal security analysis attests that the AKAS scheme not only could resist the multifarious security attacks but also improve efficiency by 21% compared with Lee et al.'s and Shu's scheme.","[Qiao, Hui; Dong, Xuewen; Shen, Yulong] Xidian Univ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Shen, YL (corresponding author), Xidian Univ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",qiaohui1007300405@163.com; xwdong@xidian.edu.cn; ylshen@mail.xidian.edu.cn,"Qiao, Hui/AAA-4976-2021",,"National key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB1400704]; Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province [2019ZDLGY12-03, 2019ZDLGY13-06, 2019ZDLGY12-04, 2019Z-DLGY13-01]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61972310, 61972308, 61902295]","This work is supported in part by the National key Research and Development Program of China under Grant No. 2017YFB1400704, the Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province under Grant No. 2019ZDLGY12-03, 2019ZDLGY13-06, 2019ZDLGY12-04 and 2019Z-DLGY13-01, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61972310, 61972308 and 61902295.","Bhuiyan MZA, 2017, IEEE T DEPEND SECURE, V14, P363, DOI 10.1109/TDSC.2015.246965; Chang YF, 2013, J MED SYST, V37, DOI 10.1007/s10916-012-9902-; Chen CT, 2015, SECUR COMMUN NETW, V8, P1608, DOI 10.1002/sec.110; Hsiang HC, 2009, COMPUT STAND INTER, V31, P1118, DOI 10.1016/j.csi.2008.11.00; Irshad A, 2017, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V77, P; Irshad A, 2017, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V76, P16463, DOI 10.1007/s11042-016-3921-; Ji YX, 2018, J MED SYST, V42, DOI 10.1007/s10916-018-0998-; Kocher P., 1999, Advances in Cryptology - CRYPTO'99. 19th Annual International Cryptology Conference.

This evaluation compares the functional size of each mobile app measured using the COSMIC method to the score of the app obtained in a previous evaluation that relied on functions extraction using a quality assessment questionnaire. It includes as well an investigation of the relationships between the functional sizes of these apps, their ratings in the apps stores, as well as the number of installs. As results, it was noticed that there is a considerable shift between the rankings of the functional sizes and the functionality scores obtained in the opinion-based questionnaire, for most of the apps assessed. Moreover, the study of the relationship between the functional sizes and the ratings, as well as the number of installs indicated that these variables are not linked, since they are impacted by external factors. The findings support the use of the COSMIC method for these apps in regard to measuring the functional size for further updates or improvements, which can also help developers to have an overview about the existing apps on the market and compare between them. Moreover, COSMIC is more effective since it covers all the features and functionalities of prenatal mPHRs.","[Bachiri, Mariam; Idri, Ali] Mohammed V Univ, ENSIAS, Software Project Management Res Team, Rabat, Morocco; [Abran, Alain] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Software Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Redman, Leanne M.] Louisiana State Univ, Pennington Biomed Res Ctr, Reprod Endocrinol & Womens Hlth Lab, Baton Rouge, LA 70808 USA; [Luis Fernandez-Aleman, Jose] Univ Murcia, Fac Comp Sci, Dept Comp, Murcia, Spain","Bachiri, M (corresponding author), Mohammed V Univ, ENSIAS, Software Project Management Res Team, Rabat, Morocco.",mariam_bachiri@um5.ac.ma; ali.idri@um5.ac.ma; alain.abran@etsmtl.ca; leanne.redman@pbrc.edu; aleman@um.es,"Bachiri, Mariam/AAI-1517-2019; Fernández-Alemán, José Luis/G-1282-2011; Abran, Alain/I-2493-2016","Bachiri, Mariam/0000-0002-0415-2285; Fernández-Alemán, José Luis/0000-0002-0176-450X; Abran, Alain/0000-0003-2670-9061; Idri, Ali/0000-0002-4586-4158",US Agency for International Development [7-246]; USAID; NAS,"This work was conducted within the research project PEER, 7-246 supported by the US Agency for International Development.

This limits the use of surgical image-guidance technologies and challenges the appropriate placement of trocars, which influences the operative ease and potential quality of laparoscopic surgery. This work describes the development of a platform that simulates pneumoperitoneum in a patient-specific manner, using preoperative CT scans as input data. This aims to provide a more realistic representation of the intraoperative scenario and guide trocar positioning to optimize the ergonomics of laparoscopic instrumentation. The simulation was developed by generating 3D reconstructions of insufflated and deflated porcine CT scans and simulating an artificial pneumoperitoneum on the deflated model. Simulation parameters were optimized by minimizing the discrepancy between the simulated pneumoperitoneum and the ground truth model extracted from insufflated porcine scans. Insufflation modeling in humans was investigated by correlating the simulation's output to real post-insufflation measurements obtained from patients in theatre. The simulation returned an average error of 7.26 mm and 10.5 mm in the most and least accurate datasets respectively. In context of the initial discrepancy without simulation (23.8 mm and 19.6 mm), the methods proposed here provide a significantly improved picture of the intraoperative scenario. The framework was also demonstrated capable of simulating pneumoperitoneum in humans. This study proposes a method for realistically simulating pneumoperitoneum to achieve optimal ergonomics during laparoscopy. Although further studies to validate the simulation in humans are needed, there is the opportunity to provide a more realistic, interactive simulation platform for future image-guided minimally invasive surgery.","[Dawda, Shivali; Camara, Mafalda; Pratt, Philip; Vale, Justin; Darzi, Ara; Mayer, Erik] Imperial Coll London, Dept Surg & Canc, London, England","Dawda, S (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Surg & Canc, London, England.",shivali.dawda@gmail.com,"; Mayer, Erik/A-6207-2013","Dawda, Shivali/0000-0002-3091-2305; Mayer, Erik/0000-0002-5509-4580",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Imperial Biomedical Research Centre (BRC),"This work is independent research funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Imperial Biomedical Research Centre (BRC).

More and more wearable medical devices (MD) with wireless communication technologies embedded are being developed by innovative academic community and companies. Optical wireless communication (OWC) consisting of Visible Light Communication (VLC), infrared (IR), Optical Camera Communication (OCC) and Light Fidelity (LiFi) along with the conventional Radio Frequency (RF) wireless communication are suitable technologies to be used for hybrid Wireless Integrated Medical Assistance Systems (WIMAS). The WIMAS addressed in this paper consists of two Wireless Medical Body Area Networks (WMBAN) (an insulin wearable kit and an ECG test device with VLC/OCC are considered) and an Emergency Remote Medical Assistance (ERMA) with LiFi technology embedded. Using RF in medical facilities is subject of strict regulations due to interferences with other RF medical devices, negative effects on human health and lack of security. VLC and OCC are suitable to be embedded in MDs in order to be used by the patients with wearable WMBAN. Research on IR transdermal communication for implantable MDs has also been demonstrated as feasible and both VLC and OCC have promising future, as well. On the other hand, LiFi technology, recently deployed on the market, is mature enough to be integrated in the ERMA system addressed here.","[Riurean, Simona; Leba, Monica; Ionica, Andreea] Univ Petrosani, Petrosani 332006, Romania; [Antipova, Tatiana] Inst Certified Specialists, Perm, Russia; [Rocha, Alvaro] Univ Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal","Riurean, S (corresponding author), Univ Petrosani, Petrosani 332006, Romania.",simonariurean@upet.ro; antipovatatianav@gmail.com; amrocha@dei.uc.pt; monicaleba@upet.ro; andreeaionica@upet.ro,"Riurean, Simona Mirela/X-3873-2019; Antipova, Tatiana/C-4240-2015; Ionica, Andreea C/B-9657-2015; Leba, Monica/B-9620-2015; Rocha, Álvaro/O-3273-2013","Riurean, Simona Mirela/0000-0002-5283-6374; Antipova, Tatiana/0000-0002-0872-4965; Ionica, Andreea C/0000-0003-1988-9340; Leba, Monica/0000-0002-4083-9121; Rocha, Álvaro/0000-0002-0750-8187",University of Petrosani,This study was funded with personal resources and had support from University of Petrosani.,"Abita JL, 2004, J HOPKINS APL TECH D, V25, P26; Al-Qahtani A., 2015, FUTURE INFORM COMMU; [Anonymous], 2012, 802156 IEEE, P1, DOI DOI 10.1109/IEEESTD.2012.616160; [Anonymous], 2018, CISC VIS NETW IND G; Ardakani MH, 2016, IEEE WCN; Arefin M.T., 2017, J COMPUT COMMUN, V5, P53, DOI [10.4236/jcc.2017.57006, DOI 10.4236/jcc.2017.57006, DOI 10.4236/JCC.2017.57006; Armstrong J, 2009, J LIGHTWAVE TECHNOL, V27, P189, DOI 10.1109/JLT.2008.201006; Baig MM, 2013, J MED SYST, V37, DOI 10.1007/s10916-012-9898-; BARRY JR, 1993, IEEE J SEL AREA COMM, V11, P367, DOI 10.1109/49.21955; Carruthers JB, 1997, IEEE T COMMUN, V45, P1260, DOI 10.1109/26.63469; Carruthers JB, 2002, IEEE T ANTENN PROPAG, V50, P759, DOI 10.1109/TAP.2002.101124; Cleveland R.F., 1999, OET B, V56, P; Dimitrov S., 2015, PRINC LED LIGHT, V84, P7; Dissanayake SD, 2013, J LIGHTWAVE TECHNOL, V31, P1063, DOI 10.1109/JLT.2013.224173; Elgala H, 2011, IEEE COMMUN MAG, V49, P56, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2011.601173; Fernando N., 2011, IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2011), P5, DOI 10.1109/ITW.2011.608956; GFELLER FR, 1979, P IEEE, V67, P1474, DOI 10.1109/PROC.1979.1150; Ghassemlooy Z., 2017, VISIBLE LIGHT COMMU; Ghassemlooy Z., 2019, OPTICAL WIRELESS COM, VSecon; Hans N, 2008, INDIAN J CRIT CARE M, V12, P170, DOI 10.4103/0972-5229.4507; JARVIS JC, 1991, J MED ENG TECHNOL, V15, P53, DOI 10.3109/0309190910900996; Jungnickel V, 2002, IEEE J SEL AREA COMM, V20, P631, DOI 10.1109/49.99552; Kahn JM, 1997, P IEEE, V85, P265, DOI 10.1109/5.55422; Lebas C, 2018, 2018 GLOBAL LIFI CONGRESS (GLC; Lee SCJ, 2009, IEEE PHOTONIC TECH L, V21, P1749, DOI 10.1109/LPT.2009.203266; Lopez-Hernandez FJ, 1997, ELECTRON LETT, V33, P1804, DOI 10.1049/el:1997122; Marin-Garcia I, 2018, IET OPTOELECTRON, V12, P289, DOI 10.1049/iet-opt.2018.505; Menezes P.

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals may provide a reasonable option for this type of identification due its unique features that overcome the lacks of other common methods. Currently, however, the processing load for such signals requires considerable time and labor. New methods and algorithms have attempted to reduce EEG processing time, including a reduction of the number of electrodes and segmenting the EEG data into its typical frequency bands. This work complements other efforts by proposing a genetic algorithm to reduce the number of necessary electrodes for measurements by EEG devices. Using a public EEG dataset of 109 subjects who underwent relaxation with eye-open and eye-closed stimuli, we aimed to determine the minimum set of electrodes required for optimum identification accuracy in each EEG sub-band of both stimuli. The results were encouraging and it was possible to accurately identify a subject using about 10 out of 64 electrodes. Moreover, higher frequency bands required a fewer number of electrodes for identification compared with lower frequency bands.","[Albasri, Ahmed; Abdali-Mohammadi, Fardin; Fathi, Abdolhossein] Razi Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Technol, Fac Engn, Kermanshah, Iran","Abdali-Mohammadi, F (corresponding author), Razi Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Technol, Fac Engn, Kermanshah, Iran.",fardin.abdali@razi.ac.ir,"Abdali-Mohammadi, Fardin/D-6558-2011; Fathi, Abdolhossein/ABH-8117-2020","Abdali-Mohammadi, Fardin/0000-0002-6691-680X; Albasri, Ahmed/0000-0002-9282-3340",,,"Aliakbaryhosseinabadi S, 2017, J NEUROSCI METH, V284, P27, DOI 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2017.04.00; Altahat S, 2015, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V9492, P162, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-26561-2_2; Arvaneh M, 2011, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V58, P1865, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2011.213114; Chatchinarat Auchin, 2016, 2016 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC).

This learning intentions at using cervical cancer risk features to build classification model using Random Forest (RF) classification technique with the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and two feature reduction techniques recursive feature elimination and principle component analysis (PCA). Utmost medical data sets are frequently imbalanced since the number of patients is considerably fewer than the number of non-patients.

Machine learning methods represent the next evolution in forecasting, but model choice and optimization remain challenging for achieving optimal results. To determine the best method to predict demand for outpatient appointments comparing machine learning and traditional methods, this retrospective study analyzed appointment requests at a major outpatient department in a destination medical center. Two separate locations (A and B) were assessed with 20 traditional, hybrid (traditional + machine learning) and machine learning methods to determine the best forecasting outcome (lowest Forecast Standard Error, FSE). Data characteristics from both datasets were examined. 20 forecasting models were then assessed and compared for the best result. Location A's data displayed a cyclical and non-trending pattern while Location B's displayed a cyclical and trending pattern. Both Location A and B yielded the feature engineered XGBoost model (machine learning) with the lowest out-of-sample FSE. It is important to carefully analyze and understand the underlying data set pattern and then test a variety of traditional, machine learning, and hybrid prediction methods to achieve optimal predictive results. Additionally, the use of feature engineering or hybrid methods can augment the usefulness of machine learning methods.","[Klute, Brian; Chen, Wei; Stelpflug, Aaron] Mayo Clin, Dept Management Engn & Internal Consulting, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Homb, Andrew] Mayo Clin, Dept Radiol, Rochester, MN USA","Chen, W (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Dept Management Engn & Internal Consulting, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.",Chen.Wei@mayo.edu,,,,,"Abdus-Salaam H., 2009, SCI TECHN HUM TIC S; Abraham G, 2009, IEEE T INF TECHNOL B, V13, P380, DOI 10.1109/TITB.2009.201456; Afilal M, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0527-; Ahmadi-Javid A, 2017, EUR J OPER RES, V258, P3, DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2016.06.06; Akyuz AO, 2017, 2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INNOVATIONS IN INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS (INISTA), P7, DOI 10.1109/INISTA.2017.800112; Al-Haque S, 2015, MIL MED, V180, P111, DOI 10.7205/MILMED-D-14-0019; Bouckaert N, 2018, HEALTH POLICY, V122, P728, DOI 10.1016/j.healthpol.2018.05.01; Boutsioli Zoe, 2009, Hosp Top, V87, P14, DOI 10.1080/0018586090332311; Brownlee J., 2018, HYPERPARAMETER OPTI; Calegari R, 2016, COMPUT MATH METHOD M, V2016, DOI 10.1155/2016/386326; Cheng CY, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0571-; Claudio David, 2014, IIE Transactions on Healthcare Systems Engineering, V4, P1, DOI 10.1080/19488300.2013.87935; Cote M J, 2001, Healthc Financ Manage, V55, P5; Cote Murray J, 2013, Hosp Top, V91, P9, DOI 10.1080/00185868.2013.75796; DeLurgio S., 2009, PRODUCTION INVENTORY, V45, P3; Heroman William M, 2012, Physician Exec, V38, P3; Hong WS, 2018, PLOS ONE, V13, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.020101; Jain A., 2016, WHAT I LEARNT TIME ; Kadri F, 2014, J MED SYST, V38, DOI 10.1007/s10916-014-0107-; Luo L, 2017, BMC HEALTH SERV RES, V17, DOI 10.1186/s12913-017-2407-; Mai Q, 2015, EMERG MED AUSTRALAS, V27, P16, DOI 10.1111/1742-6723.1234; Ouyang YC, 2018, INT J NEURAL SYST, V28, DOI 10.1142/S012906571750053; Schweigler LM, 2009, ACAD EMERG MED, V16, P301, DOI 10.1111/j.1553-2712.2009.00356.; Shan JC, 2019, IEEE T NEUR NET LEAR, V30, P486, DOI 10.1109/TNNLS.2018.284433; Sun Y, 2009, BMC EMERG MED, V9, DOI 10.1186/1471-227X-9-; Villani M, 2017, BMC HEALTH SERV RES, V17, DOI 10.1186/s12913-017-2280-; XGBoost developers, 2016, INTRO BOOSTED TREE; Yu L, 2017, EURASIA J MATH SCI T, V13, P7615, DOI 10.12973/ejmste/8030",28,6,6,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The images are received by the detector and this can be degraded by several factors like atmospherical things and device noises which emit temperature noise, processing noise and explosion noise. There are several strategies are developed already to cut back the signal to noise magnitude relation of the hyperspectral image. However, the stationary noise of the many denoising ways developed cannot be applied on to the gauge boson noise. Thus, the each gauge boson and thermal noise square measure gift within the captured hyperspectral image (HSI). during this paper, we tend to projected a replacement denoising framework known as tensor-based filtering employing a PARAFAC tensor decomposition methodology for scale back each noise. The proposed technique is performs higher in removing noise as compared with different strategies like Multiple linear regression (MLR) algorithm and combined algorithm called multidimensional wavelet transforms with multiway wiener filter (MWPT-MWF) technique. The performance analysis of the new denoising framework has more efficient for reducing signal dependent (PN) and signal independent noise (TN) as compared with other conventional method. Hence this novel denoising approach would be more beneficial for detection of skin allergy and also this algorithm will be very useful for detection of retinal exudates and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and retinopathy disease in medical application.","[Nageswaran, Kirubanandasarathy] Syed Ammal Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Ramanathapuram 623502, India; [Nagarajan, Karthikeyan] Syed Ammal Engn Coll, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Ramanathapuram 623502, India; [Bandiya, Ramasubramanian] Sarathy Sarojini Engn Coll, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Bangaluru, Karnataka, India","Nageswaran, K (corresponding author), Syed Ammal Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Ramanathapuram 623502, India.",dr_nksarathy@syedengg.ac.in; nkarthikkeyan@gmail.com; ramabannada87@gmail.com,"Nagarajan, Karthikeyan/ABI-6163-2020","Nagarajan, Karthikeyan/0000-0002-6199-5131; N, Kirubanandasarathy/0000-0002-6900-3854",,,"Aiazzi B, 2003, IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE, V41, P2531, DOI 10.1109/TGRS.2003.81881; Aiazzi B, 1997, DSP 97: 1997 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1 AND 2, P601, DOI 10.1109/ICDSP.1997.62842; Aiazzi B, 2006, ANN GEOPHYS-ITALY, V49, P; Alparone L, 2009, 2009 FIRST WORKSHOP ON HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING: EVOLUTION IN REMOTE SENSING, P364, DOI 10.1109/WHISPERS.2009.528908; Archibald R, 2007, IEEE GEOSCI REMOTE S, V4, P674, DOI 10.1109/LGRS.2007.90511; Argenti F, 2006, SIGNAL PROCESS, V86, P2056, DOI 10.1016/j.sigpro.2005.10.01; Atkinson I., 2003, P INT C IM PROC, P1; Bourennane S., 2015, REMOTE SENSING LET; Bourennane S, 2018, REMOTE SENS-BASEL, V10, DOI 10.3390/rs1009133; Bro R., 1997, CHEMOM INTELL LAB S; Cheng G, 2018, IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE, V56, P6712, DOI 10.1109/TGRS.2018.284182; Demirkesen C., 2015, IMAGE SIGNAL PROCESS, VXX; Fan YR, 2018, REMOTE SENS-BASEL, V10, DOI 10.3390/rs1001011; Gao LR, 2008, IEEE GEOSCI REMOTE S, V5, P83, DOI 10.1109/LGRS.2007.90992; Gao LR, 2017, REMOTE SENS-BASEL, V9, DOI 10.3390/rs911114; Letexier D, 2008, IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE, V46, P2061, DOI 10.1109/TGRS.2008.91664; Lin T, 2013, IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE, V51, P3529, DOI 10.1109/TGRS.2012.222506; Liu XF, 2012, IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE, V50, P3717, DOI 10.1109/TGRS.2012.218706; MALLAT SG, 1989, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V11, P674, DOI 10.1109/34.19246; Muti D, 2005, SIGNAL PROCESS, V85, P2338, DOI 10.1016/j.sigpro.2004.11.02; Pizurica A, 2006, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V15, P654, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2005.86369; Renard N, 2008, IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE, V46, P2407, DOI 10.1109/TGRS.2008.91841; Roger RE, 1996, INT J REMOTE SENS, V17, P2719, DOI 10.1080/0143116960894910; Uss ML, 2011, IEEE J-STSP, V5, P469, DOI 10.1109/JSTSP.2010.210431",24,3,3,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Higher intraocular pressure is the leading cause for this condition. Screening for glaucoma and early detection can avert vision loss. Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) is an automated process with the potential to identify glaucoma early through quantitative analysis of digital fundus images. Preparing an effective model for CAD requires a large database. This study presents a CAD tool for the precise detection of glaucoma using a machine learning approach. An autoencoder is trained to determine effective and important features from fundus images. These features are used to develop classes of glaucoma for testing. The method achieved an F-measure value of 0.95 utilizing 1426 digital fundus images (589 control and 837 glaucoma). The efficacy of the system is evident, and is suggestive of its possible utility as an additional tool for verification of clinical decisions.","[Raghavendra, U.; Gudigar, Anjan; Rao, Tejaswi N.] Manipal Acad Higher Educ, Manipal Inst Technol, Dept Instrumentat & Control Engn, Manipal 576104, Karnataka, India; [Bhandary, Sulatha V.] Manipal Acad Higher Educ, Kasturba Med Coll, Dept Ophthalmol, Manipal 576104, Karnataka, India; [Ciaccio, Edward J.] Columbia Univ, Dept Med, New York, NY USA; [Acharya, U.

It is either diagnosed malignant or benign - depending upon the severity of the infection and the current stage. The conventional methods require a detailed physical inspection by an expert dermatologist, which is time-consuming and imprecise. Therefore, several computer vision methods are introduced lately, which are cost-effective and somewhat accurate. In this work, we propose a new automated approach for skin lesion detection and recognition using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). The proposed cascaded design incorporates three fundamental steps including; a) contrast enhancement through fast local Laplacian filtering (FlLpF) along HSV color transformation; b) lesion boundary extraction using color CNN approach by following XOR operation; c) in-depth features extraction by applying transfer learning using Inception V3 model prior to feature fusion using hamming distance (HD) approach. An entropy controlled feature selection method is also introduced for the selection of the most discriminant features. The proposed method is tested on PH2 and ISIC 2017 datasets, whereas the recognition phase is validated on PH2, ISBI 2016, and ISBI 2017 datasets. From the results, it is concluded that the proposed method outperforms several existing methods and attained accuracy 98.4% on PH2 dataset, 95.1% on ISBI dataset and 94.8% on ISBI 2017 dataset.","[Saba, Tanzila; Marie-Sainte, Souad Larabi] Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia; [Khan, Muhammad Attique] HITEC Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Museum Rd, Taxila, Pakistan; [Rehman, Amjad] Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Saba, T (corresponding author), Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia.",drtsaba@gmail.com,"Khan, Muhammad Attique Attique/AAX-2644-2021; Saba, Tanzila/D-4593-2018","Khan, Muhammad Attique Attique/0000-0002-6347-4890; Saba, Tanzila/0000-0003-3138-3801",research Project [Skin Cancer Melanoma Detection from Dermoscopic Images Using Machine Learning Techniques]; Prince Sultan University; Saudi Arabia [SSP -18-5-04]; Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) Lab Prince Sultan University Riyadh Saudi Arabia,"This work was supported by the research Project [Skin Cancer Melanoma Detection from Dermoscopic Images Using Machine Learning Techniques]; Prince Sultan University; Saudi Arabia [SSP -18-5-04] Additionally, in part supported by Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) Lab Prince Sultan University Riyadh Saudi Arabia.

Our proposed algorithm combines wavelet kernel SVM with color histogram to classify pathological image. Firstly, the pathological image is divided into non-overlapping sub-patches, and the features of sub-patch histogram are extracted. Then, the global and local features are fused by the sub-patch weighting algorithm. Then, the RelicfF based forward selection algorithm is used to integrate color features and texture features so as to enhance the characterization capabilities of the tumor cell. Finally, Morlet wavelet kernel-based least squares support vector machine method is adopted to enhance the generalization ability of the model for small sample with non-linear and high-dimensional pattern classification problems. Experimental results show that the proposed pathological diagnostic algorithm can gain higher accuracy compared with existing comparison algorithms.","[Yang, Kai; Zhou, Bi; Yi, Fei; Chen, Yan; Chen, Yingsheng] Shanghai Univ Med & Hlth Sci, Shanghai Peoples Hosp 6, Dept Radiol Intervent, East Campus, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Yang, Kai; Chen, Yingsheng] Shanghai Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China","Chen, Y (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ Med & Hlth Sci, Shanghai Peoples Hosp 6, Dept Radiol Intervent, East Campus, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.",chengyingsheng@hotmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [81571773, 81781771943 81771943]; Shanghai municipal health and Family Planning Commission [201640191]","This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.81571773, 81781771943 81771943), Shanghai municipal health and Family Planning Commission (No.201640191).","[Anonymous], 1997, J CLIN PATHOL, V50, P358, DOI [10.1136/jcp.50.4.358, DOI 10.1136/JCP.50.4.358; Beretta L, 2011, J BIOMED INFORM, V44, P361, DOI 10.1016/j.jbi.2010.12.00; Cataldo S.

However, in the current medical data management, it is difficult to share medical data due to the fragmentation of medical data and the lack of effective sharing methods. On the other hand, the security of medical data is difficult to protect because the centralized data storage is vulnerable to attack and tampering. Therefore, we propose a model called Med-PPPHIS, which consists of a permission-less blockchain and a permissioned blockchain, named Med-DLattice, to serve the management of user's personal health information and form a chained protection mechanism for medical data. Med-DLattice features Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, where each account updates its Account-DAG asynchronously to other unrelated accounts. The Med-DLattice nodes can reach an efficient consensus with proposed DPoS-Quorum algorithm. Based on this model, by converting the medical data into on-chain tokens, a safe and efficient channel for data circulation is established, while the privacy of data is secured. We implement a prototype of Med-PPPHIS and introduce a blockchain-based closed-loop method for chronic disease management, which initially applies the model to national physique monitoring in Anhui Province, China. The performance of the model is evaluated by simulating 500 nodes on 25 AliCloud ECS virtual machines. Experimental result shows that Med-PPPHIS has low latency and high throughput, and the security analysis shows that the model is able to prevent Sybil attacks, DDoS attacks, etc.","[Zhou, Tong; Li, Xiaofeng; Zhao, He] Chinese Acad Sci, Hefei Inst Phys Sci, Hefei 230031, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Tong; Li, Xiaofeng] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China","Zhao, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Hefei Inst Phys Sci, Hefei 230031, Anhui, Peoples R China.",zhaoh@hfcas.ac.cn,,"Zhao, He/0000-0003-2646-7306",National Natural Science Foundation of China [61602435]; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province [1708085QF153]; Anhui Provincial Science and Technology Major Project [16030901057],"This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61602435), Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province (No. 1708085QF153), and Anhui Provincial Science and Technology Major Project (No. 16030901057).","[Anonymous], 2012, AM J TRANSPLANT, V12, P1, DOI [10.1111/j.1600-6143.2011.03886.x, DOI 10.2196/JMIR.1356; Antonopoulos A.

In this work, an algorithmic approach is proposed to detect the lung oblique fissures from lung computed tomography (CT) images. In the preprocessing module of our approach, the lung structures are enhanced using morphological operation and lung images are de-noised using Wiener filter. In the second module, lung regions are segmented using techniques, namely, thresholding and background subtraction. In the third module of our algorithm, initially, fissure regions are segmented using the active contour model, then by applying the rule based approach on the fissure regions, the oblique fissures are segmented. The proposed algorithm has been tested on 50 images collected from Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and 30 images obtained from Early Lung Cancer Action Program (ELCAP).","[Anitha, S.; Babu, T.

In this paper, the impulse noise and Rician noise in the medical MR images are removed by using Bilateral Filter (BF). The novel approaches are presented in this paper; Enhanced grasshopper optimization algorithm (EGOA) is used to optimize the BF parameters. To simulate the medical MR images (with different variances), the impulse and Rician noises are added. The EGOA is applied to the noisy image in searching regions of window size, spatial and intensity domain to obtain the filter parameters optimally. The PSNR is taken as fitness value for optimization. We examined the proposed technique results with other MR images After the optimal parameters assurance. In order to comprehend the BF parameters selection importance, the results of proposed denoising method is contrasted with other previously used BFs, genetic algorithm (GA), gravitational search algorithm (GSA) using the quality metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), structural similarity index metric (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), and PSNR. The outcome shows that the EOGA method with BF shows good results than the earlier methods in both edge preservation and noise elimination from medical MR images. The experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposed method with the accuracy, computational time, and maximum deviation, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), MSE, SSIM, and entropy values of MR images over the existing methods.","[Anoop, V.] Jyothi Engn Coll, Trichur 679531, Kerala, India; [Bipin, P.

The main objective of this proposed work is to detect and classify the various video sequences with the help of different classification algorithms. The input video sequences from the publicly available datasets are collected and the individual frames are extracted. These frames are pre-processed and then applied to the novel background subtraction process. Important features based on the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and grey level co-efficient are extracted. Finally these features are classified by three different classifiers like SVM, PLS, and PNN. The performance of these different classifiers are evaluated and compared. It is found that PLS classifier produces more classification accuracy but with more computation time.","[Balakumar, Shyamala] Mohamed Sathak Engn Coll, Dept ECE, Kilakarai, Ramanathapuram, India; [Sundaramoorthy, Selvaperumal] Syed Ammal Engn Coll, Dept EEE, Ramanathapuram, Tamil Nadu, India; [Bhoopalan, Ramasubramanian] SRM TRP Engn Coll, Dept ECE, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India; [Prabhakar, G.] VSB Engn Coll, Dept EEE, Karur, Tamil Nadu, India","Balakumar, S (corresponding author), Mohamed Sathak Engn Coll, Dept ECE, Kilakarai, Ramanathapuram, India.",shyamalabalakumar@yahoo.com,"B, Ramasubramanian/AAB-7011-2022; G, Prabhakar/ABE-7661-2020","B, Ramasubramanian/0000-0002-1853-8293; G, Prabhakar/0000-0003-4760-7646",,,"Agurto C, 2014, IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH, V18, P1328, DOI 10.1109/JBHI.2013.229639; Barnich O, 2011, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V20, P1709, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2010.210161; Bilodeau GA, 2013, 2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND ROBOT VISION (CRV), P106, DOI 10.1109/CRV.2013.2; DEJONG S, 1993, CHEMOMETR INTELL LAB, V18, P251, DOI 10.1016/0169-7439(93)85002-; ELGAMMAL A, 1999, IEEE FRAM RAT WORKS; Ianasi C., 2005, ELECT ENERG, V18, P12; Jabri S, 2000, INT C PATT RECOG, P627, DOI 10.1109/ICPR.2000.90299; Koller D., 1994, P INT C PATT REC IS; Li S., 2017, INT J SIGNAL PROCESS, V10, P23, DOI DOI 10.14257/ijsip.2017.10.3.0; Lu X, 2017, HINDAWI MATH PROBLE; Marin D, 2011, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V30, P146, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2010.206433; Patel CI, 2014, ADV MULTIMED, V2014, DOI 10.1155/2014/87907; Ramasubramanian B, 2014, APPL MECH MATER, V573, P808, DOI 10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.573.80; RAMASUBRAMANIAN B, 2012, ADV COMPUTING INT J, V3, P8; Ramasubramanian B., IET IMAGE PROCESSIN; Vl G, 2006, INT J ARTIFICIAL INT, V15, P371, DOI [10.1142/S0218213006002722, DOI 10.1142/S0218213006002722; Wren CR, 1997, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V19, P780, DOI 10.1109/34.59823; Wu QZ, 2005, PATTERN RECOGN LETT, V26, P555, DOI 10.1016/j.patrec.2004.09.01; Yang YZ, 2017, ADV MULTIMED, V2017, DOI 10.1155/2017/517901; Zhang YC, 2017, PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIFTEENTH IAPR INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE VISION APPLICATIONS - MVA2017, P444, DOI 10.23919/MVA.2017.798689",20,1,1,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

We present an exploratory study of a mobile communication system which intends to improve the mental, physical and social health of a group of vulnerable immigrant women in Spain (n=71), distinguishing between an intervention group and a non-equivalent control group. We sent automatic text messages (SMS) to the mobile phones of an intervention group formed by immigrant women who used the social services (n=44). During a 26-day intervention period, the women received 4 daily automatic text messages on their phones, at a predetermined time. We measured mood and depression symptoms at the beginning and end of the intervention, and analysed the qualitative data to determine the acceptance level of a remote message program. The mood and depression symptoms were measured with the personal health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and were significantly better in the intervention group; they evolved from an initial 9.4 (DS=6.4, range 1-25) to a 5.0 score at the end of the message period (DS=4.8); with a significant difference (t (44)=2.01, p=7.80). Most women stated that the messages had improved their mood (86.3%), which made them feel more connected to their social environment (65.9%) and that they would like to continue receiving more messages (86.6%).","[Garcia, Yolanda] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Commun Sci, Campus Vida S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain; [Ferras, Carlos] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Geog, Campus Vida S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain; [Rocha, Alvaro] Univ Coimbra, Dept Informat Engn, Coimbra, Portugal; [Aguilera, Adrian] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Social Welf, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Garcia, Y (corresponding author), Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Commun Sci, Campus Vida S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain.",yolanda.garcia.vazquez@usc.es,"Ferrás, Carlos/K-6522-2014; Rocha, Álvaro/O-3273-2013","Ferrás, Carlos/0000-0001-9499-3784; Rocha, Álvaro/0000-0002-0750-8187",General Directorate of Social Inclusion of the Xunta de Galicia; Iberian Association of Systems and Information Technology AISTI,This research would not be possible without the support and collaboration of the General Directorate of Social Inclusion of the Xunta de Galicia and the Iberian Association of Systems and Information Technology AISTI.,"Aguilera A, 2017, J MED INTERNET RES, V19, DOI 10.2196/jmir.691; Aguilera A, 2015, ARBOR, V191, DOI 10.3989/arbor.2015.771n101; Aguilera A, 2015, J AFFECT DISORDERS, V175, P471, DOI 10.1016/j.jad.2015.01.03; Alves de Sousa V, 1994, THESI; Aretxabala ME, 2012, INT EC LETT, V1, P; Campbell B, 2015, PERS UBIQUIT COMPUT, V19, P367, DOI 10.1007/s00779-014-0822-; Chamaz K, 2016, CONSTRUCTING GROUNDE, P4; Vazquez MYG, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0500-; Garcia Y, 2019, HEALTH INFORM J, V25, P1588, DOI 10.1177/146045821879268; Garcia Y, 2017, J TECHNOL HUMAN SERV, V35, P219, DOI 10.1080/15228835.2017.134567; GSMA Foundation, MOB WORLD C 2015 BA; Hall AK, 2015, ANNU REV PUBL HEALTH, V36, P393, DOI 10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031914-12285; Handley MA, 2018, ANNU REV PUBL HEALTH, V39, P5, DOI 10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040617-01412; ITU, IND DAT DISP MOB CE; Kong G, 2014, ADDICT BEHAV, V39, P907, DOI 10.1016/j.addbeh.2013.11.02; Kroenke K, 2001, J GEN INTERN MED, V16, P606, DOI 10.1046/j.1525-1497.2001.016009606.; Lopez A, 2015, CLIN SOC WORK J, V43, P189, DOI 10.1007/s10615-014-0509-; Lopez A, 2014, SOC WORK HEALTH CARE, V53, P815, DOI 10.1080/00981389.2014.94345; Proudfoot J, 2013, BMC PSYCHIATRY, V13, DOI 10.1186/1471-244X-13-31; [No title captured",20,8,8,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Image processing is a tool for identifying the substances and obtaining information from them. Medical image processing is a stimulating area to diagnose diseases specifically, brain cancer, breast cancer, liver cancer, neuro- and cardio-diseases, etc. Image segmentation is an act of segregating the images into various parts to identify a particular substance and its margins. Brain tumor is the irregular and intense growth of tissues causing cancer. The most used technique to diagnose brain tumor is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Precise information about the affected area is crucial for the appropriate treatment. As numerous data are created in MRI diagnosis, an automated segmentation technique is necessary to obtain precise information of tumor. In this paper we presented Depth-First Search (DFS) segmentation algorithm based on graph theory. Here the image pixels are arranged into a tree like structure based on their proximity in the image. The experimental results are compared with other existing systems. Also performance measures of ANFIS classifier and SVM classifier are compared. It distinguishes healthy cells from the cells affected by brain tumors. In the proposed method, the computational complexity is reduced and accuracy is enhanced.","[Janardhanaprabhu, S.] AURCM, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Malathi, V.] AURCM, Dept Elect Elect Engn, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India","Janardhanaprabhu, S (corresponding author), AURCM, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.",sjanatce@gmail.com; vmeee@autmdu.ac.in,,,,,"Acharya T, 2005, IMAGE PROCESSING: PRINCIPLES AND APPLICATIONS, P1, DOI 10.1002/047174579; Al-Badarnech A., 2012, CLASSIFIER DETECT TU, V14; Al-Tarawneh M.S., 2012, LEONARDO ELECT J PRA, V11, P147, DOI DOI 10.1504/IJNDC.2017.08364; AMUTHA A, 2012, EUR J SCI RES, V90, P17; [Anonymous], 2014, GEN INF AD BRAIN TU; Aparna M., 2016, INT J ADV RES COMPUT, V5, P; Azhari EEM., 2014, INT J INFORM TECHNOL, V4, P1, DOI [10.5121/ijitcs.2014.4101, DOI 10.5121/IJITCS.2014.4101; BalajiKanade P., 2015, INT J INNOVATIVE RES, V; BalajiKanade P., 2015, INT J INNOV RES ELEC, V; Borole Vipin Y, 2015, INT J EMERG TRENDS T, V; Chandra S, 2014, ADV GEOGR EVIRON SCI, P177, DOI 10.1007/978-4-431-54871-3_1; Dubey R.

In HCS, constitute a group communication among doctors, patient, caretaker, ambulance, and hospital, which intern's devices transfer personal information from one to many group members. Providing security on the personal health information is the most critical issue, because malicious access on this information may leads to life threads. Concurrently, traditional cryptographic framework has unsuccessful to protection to the HCS over lightweight communications network. So, the proposed framework deals the security flaws through hyper elliptic curve based public key cryptosystem, which combines Digital Signature algorithm, Elgamal approaches that ensure the entity authentication and secure group communication.

However, most multi-atlas-based methods depend on the registration that may not give the correct information during the label propagation. To address the issue, we designed a new automatic labeling method through the hashing retrieval based atlas forest. The proposed method propagates labels without registration to reduce the errors, and constructs a target-oriented learning model to integrate information among the atlases. This method innovates a coarse classification strategy to preprocess the dataset, which retains the integrity of dataset and reduces computing time. Furthermore, the method considers each voxel in the atlas as a sample and encodes these samples with hashing for the fast sample retrieval. In the stage of labeling, the method selects suitable samples through hashing learning and trains atlas forests by integrating the information from the dataset. Then, the trained model is used to predict the labels of the target. Experimental results on two datasets illustrated that the proposed method is promising in the automatic labeling of MR brain images.","[Liu, Hong; Xu, Lijun; Song, Enmin; Jin, Renchao] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Hung, Chih-Cheng] Kennesaw State Univ, Marietta, GA USA","Song, EM (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",enmin_song@126.com,"Jin, Renchao/F-4880-2018","Jin, Renchao/0000-0002-1591-3510",National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0112804],This study was funded by National Key R&D Program of China(2017YFC0112804).,"Akselrod-Ballin A., 2006, ATLAS GUIDED IDENTIF, P20; Aljabar P, 2009, NEUROIMAGE, V46, P726, DOI 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.02.01; Bai WJ, 2015, MED IMAGE ANAL, V19, P98, DOI 10.1016/j.media.2014.09.00; Bai WJ, 2013, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V32, P1302, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2013.225692; Bauer S, 2013, PHYS MED BIOL, V58, pR97, DOI 10.1088/0031-9155/58/13/R9; Burgos N, 2017, PHYS MED BIOL, V62, P4237, DOI 10.1088/1361-6560/aa66b; Cao L, 2018, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V77, P29669, DOI 10.1007/s11042-017-5581-; Chen H, 2016, VOXRESNET DEEP VOXE; Coupe P, 2010, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V6363, P12; Garcia-Lorenzo D, 2013, MED IMAGE ANAL, V17, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.media.2012.09.00; Hao YF, 2014, HUM BRAIN MAPP, V35, P2674, DOI 10.1002/hbm.2235; Heckemann RA, 2006, NEUROIMAGE, V33, P115, DOI 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.05.06; Huo J, 2018, NEUROIMAGE, V175, P201, DOI 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.04.00; Iglesias JE, 2016, NEUROIMAGE, V141, P542, DOI 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.07.02; Isgum I, 2015, MED IMAGE ANAL, V20, P135, DOI 10.1016/j.media.2014.11.00; Kasiri K, 2010, 2010 2nd International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications (IPTA 2010), P306, DOI 10.1109/IPTA.2010.558677; Klein A, 2012, FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ, V6, DOI 10.3389/fnins.2012.0017; Makropoulos A, 2014, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V33, P1818, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2014.232228; Quinlan J.

Several studies exist describing the benefits and advantages of this technology as a complement to psychotherapeutic interventions for the prevention and treatment of depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder, to name a few. A small number of these works implement capabilities in the virtual agent focused on the detection and prevention of suicidality risks. The work presented in this paper describes the development of an embodied conversational agent used as the main interface in HelPath, a mobile-based application addressed to individuals detected with any of the suicidal behaviours: ideation, planning or attempt. The main objective of HelPath is to continuously collect user's information that, complemented with data from the electronic health record, supports the identification of risks associated with suicidality. Through the virtual agent, the users also receive information and suggestions based on cognitive behaviour therapy that would help them to maintain a healthy condition. The paper also presents the execution of an exploratory pilot to assess the acceptability, perception and adherence of users towards the virtual agent. The obtained results are presented and discussed, and some actions for further improvement of the embodied conversational agent are also identified.","[Martinez-Miranda, Juan] CONACYT, Ctr Invest Cient & Educ Super Ensenada, Unidad Transferencia Tecnol, Tepic, Mexico; [Martinez, Ariadna; Aguilar, Hector; Jimenez, Liliana; Valencia, Elizabeth] Serv Salud Nayarit, Tepic, Mexico; [Ramos, Roberto; Rosales, Giovanni] Ctr Invest Cient & Educ Super Ensenada, Unidad Transferencia Tecnol, Tepic, Mexico; [Arias, Hodwar] Univ Vizcaya, Tepic, Mexico","Martinez-Miranda, J (corresponding author), CONACYT, Ctr Invest Cient & Educ Super Ensenada, Unidad Transferencia Tecnol, Tepic, Mexico.",jmiranda@cicese.mx,"Martínez-Miranda, Juan/ABB-7942-2020","Martínez-Miranda, Juan/0000-0001-5081-8212",Mexican National Research Council (CONACyT) [2016-1-273163],This study was funded by the Mexican National Research Council (CONACyT grant number 2016-1-273163).,"Avradinis N, 2013, SPRINGERPLUS, V2, DOI 10.1186/2193-1801-2-24; Baylor A.

NBN is a protein coding gene (Breast Cancer); Nibrin is used to fix and rebuild the body from damages caused because of strand breaks (both singular and double) associated with protein nibrin. NBN gene was retrieved from dbSNP/NCBI database and investigated using computational SNP analysis tools. The encrypted region in SNPs (exonal SNPs) were analyzed using software tools, SIFT, Provean, Polyphen, INPS, SNAP and Phd-SNP. The 3'ends of SNPs in un-translated region were also investigated to determine the impact of binding. The association of NBN gene polymorphism leads to several diseases was studied. Four SNPs were predicted to be highly damaged in coding regions which are responsible for the diseases such as, Aplastic Anemia, Nijmegan breakage syndrome, Microsephaly normal intelligence, immune deficiency and hereditary cancer predisposing syndrome (clivar). The present study will be helpful in finding the suitable drugs in future for various diseases especially for breast cancer.","[Nithya, P.; ChandraSekar, A.] St Josephs Coll Engn, CSE Dept, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","Nithya, P (corresponding author), St Josephs Coll Engn, CSE Dept, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.",nithyaraju.r@gmail.com; drchandrucse@gmail.com,"ARUMUGAM, CHANDRASEKAR/N-7920-2019","ARUMUGAM, CHANDRASEKAR/0000-0002-3649-0959",,,"Adzhubei IA, 2010, NAT METHODS, V7, P248, DOI 10.1038/nmeth0410-24; Brascoupe S, 2009, INT J INDIG HEALTH, V5, P; Capriotti E, 2005, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V33, pW306, DOI 10.1093/nar/gki37; Choi YH, 2012, PLOS ONE, V7, DOI [10.1371/journal.pone.0039927, 10.1371/journal.pone.0046688; Chompret A, 2000, BRIT J CANCER, V82, P193; Johnson AD, 2008, BIOINFORMATICS, V24, P2938, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btn56; Marchini J, 2007, NAT GENET, V39, P906, DOI 10.1038/ng208; Nichols KE, 2001, CANCER EPIDEM BIOMAR, V10, P8; Safran M, 2010, DATABASE-OXFORD, DOI 10.1093/database/baq02; Savojardo C, 2016, BIOINFORMATICS, V32, P2542, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btw19; Sherry ST, 2001, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V29, P308, DOI 10.1093/nar/29.1.30; Sim NL, 2012, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V40, pW452, DOI 10.1093/nar/gks53; Vijayakumar K., 2019, Cluster Computing, V22, P10789, DOI 10.1007/s10586-017-1176-; Vijayakumar K, 2017, J AMB INTEL HUM COMP, DOI [10.1007/s12652-017-0503-7, DOI 10.1007/S12652-017-0503-7; Zeggini E, 2008, NAT GENET, V40, P638, DOI 10.1038/ng.12",15,3,3,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

An effective system for denoising in order to remove white, salt and also pepper noises by means of merging the Long Short-Term Memory, otherwise known as LSTM, based Batch Normalization and Recurrent Neural Network or RNN techniques have been proposed in this research paper. The images of the lung CT are considered as an input in this particular work. Following this, an effectual batch size is calculated by employing the method of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). To denoise the image, Recurrent Neural Network or RNN algorithm were proposed, here to reduce the internal covariate shift present in the neural networks, the Long Short-Term Memory or LSTM based Batch Normalization is brought-in. With respect to SNR or Peak Signal to Noise Ratio and Mean Square Error (MSE), operations were assessed. This algorithm is considered as competitive to other denoising schemes which have been confirmed by the experimental outcomes.","[Rajeev, R.] Sri Ramakrishna Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Informat Technol, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Samath, J.

It can be based on various criteria such as face image, DNA methylation, chest plate radiographs, knee radiographs, dental images and etc. Most of the age prediction researches have mainly been based on images. Since the image processing and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have grown up, the investigations were led to use them in age prediction problem. The implementations would be used in different fields, especially in medical applications. Brain Age Estimation (BAE) has attracted more attention in recent years and it would be so helpful in early diagnosis of some neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, etc. BAE is performed on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images to compute the brain ages. Studies based on brain MRI shows that there is a relation between accelerated aging and accelerated brain atrophy. This refers to the effects of neurodegenerative diseases on brain structure while making the whole of it older. This paper reviews and summarizes the main approaches for age prediction based on brain MRI images including preprocessing methods, useful tools used in different research works and the estimation algorithms. We categorize the BAE methods based on two factors, first the way of processing MRI images, which includes pixel-based, surface-based, or voxel-based methods and second, the generation of ML algorithms that includes traditional or Deep Learning (DL) methods. The modern techniques as DL methods help MRI based age prediction to get results that are more accurate. In recent years, more precise and statistical ML approaches have been utilized with the help of related tools for simplifying computations and getting accurate results.

For a reliable early detection of atherosclerosis, Intima Media Thickness (IMT) measurement and classification are important. A new method for decision support purpose for the classification of IMT was proposed in this study. Ultrasound images are used for IMT measurements. Images are classified and evaluated by experts. This is a manual procedure, so it causes subjectivity and variability in the IMT classification. Instead, this article proposes a methodology based on artificial intelligence methods for IMT classification. For this purpose, a deep learning strategy with multiple hidden layers has been developed. In order to create the proposed model, convolutional neural network algorithm, which is frequently used in image classification problems, is used. 501 ultrasound images from 153 patients were used to test the model. The images are classified by two specialists, then the model is trained and tested on the images, and the results are explained. The deep learning model in the study achieved an accuracy of 89.1% in the IMT classification with 89% sensitivity and 88% specificity.

ECG signals are affected by various noises such as Electrode Contact, Baseline Wandering, Motion artifact, Power-line interference, Muscle Contractions, and Electrosurgical noise during data acquisition. Denoising is a technique which is used for removing the noise in ECG signals which keeps the useful information. In this paper, a new category of Wavelet shrinkage methods is proposed. The white Gaussian noise is mixed with the ECGs for simulation and tested with the new class of shrinkage function and is compared with the other wavelet shrinkage functions such as hard and soft shrinkage. The performance measures such as Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Percent Root mean - square Difference (PRD) etc. are used to examine the performance of various shrinkage functions. The experimental result shows that it gives better MSE over conventional shrinkage functions.","[Selvakumarasamy, K.] Anna Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Poornachandra, S.] Excel Engn Coll, Komaraplayam, India; [Amutha, R.] SSN Coll Engn, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","Selvakumarasamy, K (corresponding author), Anna Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.",selvakumarasamy.k@aalimec.ac.in,,", Poornachandra/0000-0003-4954-9427",,,"Bindu CH, 2018, SPRINGERBR APPL SCI, P57, DOI 10.1007/978-981-10-6653-5_; BREIMAN L, 1995, TECHNOMETRICS, V37, P373, DOI 10.2307/126973; BRUCE A, 1995, P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS, V2569, P270, DOI 10.1117/12.21758; Bruce AG, 1996, BIOMETRIKA, V83, P727, DOI 10.1093/biomet/83.4.72; DONOHO DL, 1995, IEEE T INFORM THEORY, V41, P613, DOI 10.1109/18.38200; DONOHO DL, 1994, BIOMETRIKA, V81, P425, DOI 10.1093/biomet/81.3.42; Donoho DL, 1998, ANN STAT, V26, P87; Durand S, 2001, INT CONF ACOUST SPEE, P3685, DOI 10.1109/ICASSP.2001.94064; FRIESEN GM, 1990, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V37, P85, DOI 10.1109/10.4362; Gao HY, 1997, STAT SINICA, V7, P85; Gao HY, 1998, J COMPUT GRAPH STAT, V7, P46; He H, 2015, IEEE INT CONF COMP, P3; Poornachandra S, 2008, DIGIT SIGNAL PROCESS, V18, P116, DOI 10.1016/j.dsp.2007.03.01; Poornachandra S, 2008, DIGIT SIGNAL PROCESS, V18, P49, DOI 10.1016/j.dsp.2007.09.00; Poornachandra S, 2007, DIGIT SIGNAL PROCESS, V17, P485, DOI 10.1016/j.dsp.2006.10.00; Poornachandra S, 2005, DIGIT SIGNAL PROCESS, V15, P317, DOI 10.1016/j.dsp.2004.12.00; Poornachandra S, 2006, EURASIP J APPL SIG P, DOI 10.1155/ASP/2006/8123; Saranya S.

The reality of cancer patients rely on the diagnosis of cancer at the early stages (either in stage 1 or stage 2). If the cancer is diagnosed in stage 3 or later stages means the changes of survival of the patient will become more critical. Normally, single patient records will generate a huge amount of data if the data could be manage and analyze means to solve many problems for identifying the patterns it will leads to diagnose the cancer. Recent work several machine learning algorithms are introduced for the classification of cancer. However still the classification accuracy of machine learning algorithms are reduced because of huge number of samples. So the proposed work introduces a new Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is focused in this work. In this paper, the proposed phenotype techniques are used which handle and classifies the raw EHR (Electronic Health Record) and EMR (Electronic Medical Record). It is based on the HDFS and Two-Phase Map Reduce. Phenotype algorithm uses NLP (National Language Processing) tool which will analyze and classify the cancer patient data like gene mapping, age related data, image and ultrasonic frequency processing, identification and analysis of irregularities, disease and personal histories. In this paper, the three factorized model is used which calculates the mean score values. The values are calculated by disease stage, pain status, etc. This paper focuses big data analytics for cancer diagnosis and the simulation results shows the proposed system produces the highest performance.","[Sivakumar, K.; Nithya, N.

Big data analysis plays a crucial role to predict future status of healthand offerspreeminenthealth outcome to people. Heart disease is a prevalent disease cause's death around the world. A lotof research is going onpredictive analytics using machine learning techniques to reveal better decision making. Big data analysis fosters great opportunities to predict future health status from health parameters and provide best outcomes. WeusedBig Data Predictive Analytics Model for Disease Prediction using Naive Bayes Technique (BPA-NB). It providesprobabilistic classification based on Bayes' theorem with independence assumptions between the features. Naive Bayes approach suitable for huge data sets especially for bigdata. The Naive Bayes approachtrain the heart disease data taken from UCI machine learning repository. Then, it was making predictions on the test data to predict the classification. The results reveal that the proposed BPA-NB scheme providesbetter accuracy about 97.12% to predict the disease rate. The proposed BPA-NB scheme used Hadoop-spark as big data computing tool to obtain significant insight on healthcare data. The experiments are done to predict different patients' future health condition. It takes the training dataset to estimate the health parameters necessary for classification. The results show the early disease detection to figure out future health of patients.","[Venkatesh, R.; Kahappan, M.] Ramco Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Rajapalayam, Tamil Nadu, India; [Balasubramanian, C.] PSR Engn Coll, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu, India","Venkatesh, R (corresponding author), Ramco Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Rajapalayam, Tamil Nadu, India.",venkey88me@gmail.com; rc.balasubramanian@gmail.com; kalsrajan@yahoo.co.in,"Chellaiah, Balasubramanian/Y-9460-2019; M, Kaliappan/AED-9844-2022","Chellaiah, Balasubramanian/0000-0001-9066-7287; M, Kaliappan/0000-0001-6177-7428; R, VENKATESH/0000-0002-4786-3917",,,"Andreu-Perez J., 2015, IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH, V16, P1; [Anonymous], 2017, J NURS CARE, DOI DOI 10.4172/2167-1168.100039; Banu N.

The other hand based modalities such as vein, and finger knuckle are gaining importance. This paper proposes a methodology for secure biometrics authentication using Finger Knuckle Print (FKP). The texture patterns from finger knuckle are extracted using Gabor with Exception-Maximization (EM) algorithm and the feature vectors from these texture patterns are acquired using Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm. The main focus is to reduce the false rejection rate without increasing the false acceptance rate and to improve the performance over the conventional hand based modalities. The performance is compared with Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR). One of the advantages of FKP authentication is its user friendliness in data collection.","[Vidhyapriya, R.] PSG Coll Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Rose, Lovelyn S.] PSG Coll Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India","Vidhyapriya, R (corresponding author), PSG Coll Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.",rvidhyapriya@gmail.com; slr.cse@psgtech.ac.in,,"Ranganathan, Vidhyapriya/0000-0003-0665-6820; rose, lovelyn/0000-0003-3854-4495",,,"[Anonymous], 2009, IEEE T INFORM FORENS, V; Gao GW, 2013, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V22, P5050, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2013.228142; Kulkarni S.

These agents are used to analyse the medical forums and results or findings are derived accurately than any manual approach. Multiple Agents have been used to analyse the blogs by dividing the work areas and communicating themselves using Agent Communication Language (ACL) and FIPA. The local solutions thus formed are forwarded to a global agent. This Global Agent controls all operations and makes the decision about the best solution. As the Global Agent controls all other agents, it eradicates unwanted and ineffective communication between the various local agents and hence keeping the time taken for communication at the minimum level. Based on these solutions a prioritization matrix is formed using advanced clustering techniques to create a prioritized content of suggested best solutions. Once the decision is made, the refining process runs several times recursively checking for all possible better solutions solving the input. On completion of this process, the Global Agent returns the exact result of the discussion. This process saves time rather than researching the entire blog for result data. This advanced approach lights a different way of obtaining solution keeping the time taken for discussion and intercommunication between the agents to the minimal level but not compromising on the perfection of the solution at the same time.","[Vijayakumar, K.] St Josephs Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Kumar, K.

However, the nature of ovarian cysts lacks accurate judgement, leading to that many patients with benign nodules still need Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsies or surgeries, increasing the physical pain and mental pressure of patients as well as unnecessary medical health care costs. Therefore, we present an image diagnosis system for classifying the ovarian cysts in color ultrasound images, which novelly applies the image features fused by both high-level features from deep learning network and low-level features from texture descriptor. Firstly, the ultrasound images are enhanced to improve the quality of training data set and the rotation invariant uniform local binary pattern (ULBP) features are extracted from each of the images as the low-level texture features. Then the high-level deep features extracted by the fine-tuned GoogLeNet neural network and the low-level ULBP features are normalized and cascaded as one fusion feature that can represent both the semantic context and the texture patterns distributed in the image. Finally, the fusion features are input to the Cost-sensitive Random Forest classifier to classify the images into malignant and benign. The high-level features extracted by the deep neural network from the medical ultrasound image can reflect the visual features of the lesion region, while the low-level texture features can describe the edges, direction and distribution of intensities. Experimental results indicate that the combination of the two types of features can describe the differences between the lesion regions and other regions, and the differences between lesions regions of malignant and benign ovarian cysts.","[Zhang, Lei; Huang, Jian; Liu, Li] Tianjin Cent Hosp Gynecol Obstet, Ultrasound Ctr, Tianjin 300052, Peoples R China","Liu, L (corresponding author), Tianjin Cent Hosp Gynecol Obstet, Ultrasound Ctr, Tianjin 300052, Peoples R China.",liliu_dsj10@163.com,,,,,"Acharya UR, 2014, TECHNOL CANCER RES T, V13, P289, DOI 10.7785/tcrt.2012.50038; Acharya UR, 2013, P I MECH ENG H, V227, P284, DOI 10.1177/095441191247242; Aliamiri Alireza, 2018, 2018 IEEE EMBS International Conference on Biomedical & Health Informatics (BHI), P442, DOI 10.1109/BHI.2018.833346; [Anonymous], 2010, INT J ENG INTELL SY; Bengio Y, 2013, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V35, P1798, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.2013.5; Chang CY, 2010, PATTERN RECOGN, V43, P3494, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2010.04.02; Chang CY, 2010, BIOMED ENG-APP BAS C, V22, P91, DOI 10.4015/S101623721000181; Chen SJ, 2010, ULTRASOUND MED BIOL, V36, P2018, DOI 10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2010.08.01; Cheng DC, 2008, IEEE T INF TECHNOL B, V12, P792, DOI 10.1109/TITB.2008.92641; Costa AC, 2018, DATA AUGMENTATION D; de Leon A, 2018, ADV CANCER RES, V139, P57, DOI 10.1016/bs.acr.2018.04.00; Deng L, 2013, FOUND TRENDS SIGNAL, V7, pI, DOI 10.1561/200000003; Faust O, 2018, BIOCYBERN BIOMED ENG, V38, P275, DOI 10.1016/j.bbe.2018.01.00; Ghatwary N., 2019, INT J COMPUTER ASSIS, P; Huang GB, 2006, NEUROCOMPUTING, V70, P489, DOI 10.1016/j.neucom.2005.12.12; Huang GB, 2012, IEEE T SYST MAN CY B, V42, P513, DOI 10.1109/TSMCB.2011.216860; Iakovidis DK, 2008, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V5112, P750, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-69812-8_7; Kam H.

This study mainly concentrates on common and plantar warts. There are various treatment methods for this disease, including the popular immunotherapy and cryotherapy methods. Manual evaluation of the WD treatment response is challenging. Furthermore, traditional machine learning methods are not robust enough in WD classification as they cannot deal effectively with small number of attributes. This study proposes a new evolutionary-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system using machine learning to classify the WD treatment response. The main architecture of our CAD system is based on the combination of improved adaptive particle swarm optimization (IAPSO) algorithm and artificial immune recognition system (AIRS). The cross-validation protocol was applied to test our machine learning-based classification system, including five different partition protocols (K2, K3, K4, K5 and K10). Our database consisted of 180 records taken from immunotherapy and cryotherapy databases. The best results were obtained using the K10 protocol that provided the precision, recall, F-measure and accuracy values of 0.8908, 0.8943, 0.8916 and 90%, respectively. Our IAPSO system showed the reliability of 98.68%. It was implemented in Java, while integrated development environment (IDE) was implemented using NetBeans. Our encouraging results suggest that the proposed IAPSO-AIRS system can be employed for the WD management in clinical environment.","[Abdar, Moloud; Makarenkov, Vladimir] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Informat, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Wijayaningrum, Vivi Nur] Politekn Negeri Malang, Dept Informat Technol, Malang, East Java, Indonesia; [Hussain, Sadiq] Dibrugarh Univ, Dibrugarh, Assam, India; [Alizadehsani, Roohallah] Deakin Univ, IISRI, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Plawiak, Pawel] Cracow Univ Technol, Inst Telecomp, Fac Phys Math & Comp Sci, Krakow, Poland; [Acharya, U.

It is a mood disorder which can be detected using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The manual detection of depression by analyzing the EEG signals requires lot of experience, tedious and time consuming. Hence, a fully automated depression diagnosis system developed using EEG signals will help the clinicians. Therefore, we propose a deep hybrid model developed using convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) architectures to detect depression usingEEG signals. In the deep model, temporal properties of the signals are learned with CNN layers and the sequence learning process is provided through the LSTM layers. In this work, we have used EEG signals obtained from left and right hemispheres of the brain. Our work has provided 99.12% and 97.66% classification accuracies for the right and left hemisphere EEG signals respectively. Hence, we can conclude that the developed CNN-LSTM model is accurate and fast in detecting the depression using EEG signals. It can be employed in psychiatry wards of the hospitals to detect the depression using EEG signals accurately and thusaid the psychiatrists.","[Ay, Betul; Aydin, Galip] Firat Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Elazig, Turkey; [Yildirim, Ozal; Talo, Muhammed; Baloglu, Ulas Baran] Munzur Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Tunceli, Turkey; [Puthankattil, Subha D.] Natl Inst Technol Calicut, Dept Elect Engn, Calicut, Kerala, India; [Acharya, U.

A non-quantifiable local feature is adopted in this paper to design a robust texture descriptor so as to enhance the robustness of the texture classification in the rotation and scale changes, which can improve the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid nodules in ultrasound images. First of all, the concept of local feature with rotational symmetry is introduced. It is found that many rotation invariant local features are rotational symmetric to a certain degree. Therefore, we propose a novel local feature to describe the rotation invariant properties of the texture. In order to deal with the change of rotation and scale of ultrasound thyroid nodules in image, Pairwise rotation-invariant spatial context feature is adopted to analyze the texture feature, which can combine with the scale information without increasing the dimension of the local feature. The fadopted local features have strong robustness to rotation and gray intensity variation. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the existing algorithms on thyroid ultrasound data sets, which greatly improve the Diagnosis accuracy of thyroid nodules.","[Bi, Li; Shuang, Zhang] Jinzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Jinzhou 121001, Liaoning, Peoples R China","Bi, L (corresponding author), Jinzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Jinzhou 121001, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",13941647321@163.com,,,,,"Ardakani AA, 2015, J ULTRAS MED, V34, P1983, DOI 10.7863/ultra.14.0905; Bo Z., 2010, CHINESE J MED IMAGI; Calonder M, 2010, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V6314, P778, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-15561-1_5; Chen J, 2010, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V32, P1705, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.2009.15; Cimpoi M, 2014, PROC CVPR IEEE, P3606, DOI 10.1109/CVPR.2014.46; Crosier M, 2010, INT J COMPUT VISION, V88, P447, DOI 10.1007/s11263-009-0315-; CROSS GR, 1983, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V5, P25, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.1983.476734; HARALICK RM, 1973, IEEE T SYST MAN CYB, VSMC3, P610, DOI 10.1109/TSMC.1973.430931; Heng Z, 2018, CHINESE COMPUTED ME; Ivanac G, 2007, ULTRASCHALL MED, V28, P502, DOI 10.1055/s-2007-96302; Jang M, 2012, J ULTRAS MED, V31, P197, DOI 10.7863/jum.2012.31.2.19; Mehta R., 2014, P AS C COMP VIS, P164; Moon WJ, 2008, RADIOLOGY, V247, P762, DOI 10.1148/radiol.247307094; Nixon IJ, 2013, HEAD NECK-J SCI SPEC, V35, P1022, DOI 10.1002/hed.2307; Nixon IJ, 2010, SURGERY, V148, P1120, DOI 10.1016/j.surg.2010.09.03; Ojal LX, 2009, J ULTRAS MED, V28, P861, DOI [10.7863/jum.2009.28.7.861, DOI 10.7863/JUM.2009.28.7.861; Ojala T, 2002, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V24, P971, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.2002.101762; Perronnin F, 2010, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V6314, P143, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-15561-1_1; Qian PJ, 2018, INFORM SCIENCES, V422, P51, DOI 10.1016/j.ins.2017.08.09; Qian PJ, 2017, KNOWL-BASED SYST, V130, P33, DOI 10.1016/j.knosys.2017.05.01; Sharma G, 2012, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V7578, P1, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-33786-4_; Urbach ER, 2007, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V29, P272, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.2007.2; Varma M, 2005, INT J COMPUT VISION, V62, P61, DOI 10.1023/B:VISI.0000046589.39864.e; Varma M, 2009, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V31, P2032, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.2008.18; Weyl H., 1952, SYMMETR; Wu JX, 2011, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V33, P1489, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.2010.22; Xia KJ, 2019, J MED SYST, V43, DOI 10.1007/s10916-018-1116-; Xia KJ, 2018, J MED IMAG HEALTH IN, V8, P1342, DOI 10.1166/jmihi.2018.247; Xu Y, 2010, PROC CVPR IEEE, P161, DOI 10.1109/CVPR.2010.554021",29,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Multiple time series clinical liver cancer dataset is collected from different dataset and time interval. A merging algorithm is used to merge all attributes collected from different sources in multiple time periods. In order to preserve the originality of information, statistical measures of each attribute is calculated and considered them as additional attributes for accurate prediction. However the merged dataset is unbalanced, in which, the number of samples from HCC recurrence class is much smaller than from HCC non recurrence. The feature weighting scheme select optimal features and parameter of classifiers are sequentially obtained from multiple iterations which causes higher computation time. In this paper, an efficient sampling approach is proposed using Inverse Random under Sampling (IRUS) to overcome class imbalance issue. IRUS under sample the majority class which creates a number of distinct partitions with a boundary separated minority and majority class samples. Additionally an optimization approach is proposed using Artificial Plant Optimization (APO) algorithm to select optimal features and parameters of classifiers to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of classification. The optimization approach reduces the number of iteration and computation time for feature selection and parameter selection for classifiers which classify the recurrence and non recurrence of HCC. Classify patients with HCC and without HCC based on optimal features and parameters by Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest(RF) classifiers. Finally, the experimental results are conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method over existing method in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and balanced accuracy.","[Divya, R.; Radha, P.] Govt Arts Coll Autonomous, PG & Res Dept Comp Sci, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India","Divya, R (corresponding author), Govt Arts Coll Autonomous, PG & Res Dept Comp Sci, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.",r.divyarun@gmail.com; radhamuthu.cbe@gmail.com,,,,,"Aravalli RN, 2008, HEPATOLOGY, V48, P2047, DOI 10.1002/hep.2258; Batal I, 2011, IEEE INT C BIOINFORM, P358, DOI 10.1109/BIBM.2011.3; Campos M, 2007, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V4594, P6; Dimitroulis D, 2017, WORLD J GASTROENTERO, V23, P5282, DOI 10.3748/wjg.v23.i29.528; El-Serag HB, 2007, GASTROENTEROLOGY, V132, P2557, DOI 10.1053/j.gastro.2007.04.06; Gao XY, 2016, NEUROCOMPUTING, V173, P1927, DOI 10.1016/j.neucom.2015.09.06; Ghalwash MF, 2012, BMC BIOINFORMATICS, V13, DOI 10.1186/1471-2105-13-19; Han J, 2012, MOR KAUF D, P; Kar P, 2014, J CLIN EXP HEPATOL, V4, pS34, DOI 10.1016/j.jceh.2014.02.15; Mirza B, 2015, NEUROCOMPUTING, V149, P316, DOI 10.1016/j.neucom.2014.03.07; Nagavelli R, 2014, INT C REC ADV INN EN, P; Pang SN, 2013, NEURAL NETWORKS, V44, P87, DOI 10.1016/j.neunet.2013.02.00; Poon D, 2009, LANCET ONCOL, V10, P1111, DOI 10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70241-; Sathe S, 2013, PROC INT CONF DATA, P841, DOI 10.1109/ICDE.2013.654487; Schmidt R, 2005, INT J MED INFORM, V74, P307, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2004.03.00; Stacey M, 2007, ARTIF INTELL MED, V39, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.artmed.2006.08.00; Tahir MA, 2012, PATTERN RECOGN, V45, P3738, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2012.03.01; Tatsumi K, 2010, 2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (SMC 2010), P1338, DOI 10.1109/ICSMC.2010.564245; Tseng YJ, 2015, IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH, V19, P1036, DOI 10.1109/JBHI.2014.235771; Waller LP, 2015, WORLD J HEPATOL, V7, P2648, DOI 10.4254/wjh.v7.i26.264; Yin Z, 2014, COMPUT METH PROG BIO, V115, P119, DOI 10.1016/j.cmpb.2014.04.01",21,5,5,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

For this problem, a two-steps segmentation algorithm based on Hessian matrix and level set is proposed in this paper. Firstly, potential blood vessels of coronary images are preliminary extracted via Hessian matrix eigenvalues feature vectors of the geometric features and the response function. Then a novel regularization and area constraint is introduced into the local data energy fitting functional. Finally, the precision of Coronary Artery image is obtained in the evolution of the level set function. Experiments show that our proposed algorithm has better performance to these comparison segmentation algorithms.","[Ge, Shang; Shi, Zhaofei; Peng, Guangming; Zhu, Zhaohuan] Nanjing Med Univ, Affiliated Huaian 1 Peoples Hosp, Huaian 223300, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Zhu, ZH (corresponding author), Nanjing Med Univ, Affiliated Huaian 1 Peoples Hosp, Huaian 223300, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",z_zzh1966@sina.com,,,,,"Brieva J., 2013, XRAY ANGIOGRAPHIC I; Cao YH, 2017, COMPUT MATH METHOD M, V2017, DOI 10.1155/2017/471030; Cervantes-Sanchez F., 2017, APPL RADIAT ISOTOPE; Feng CL, 2016, J MED IMAG HEALTH IN, V6, P1727, DOI 10.1166/jmihi.2016.187; Gao HH, 2017, IEEE ACCESS, V5, P11700, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.271532; Jiang Yizhang, IEEE T NEURAL SYSTEM, V25, P227; Jodas D.

Japan's nationwide survey of hospitals was utilized to extract the EHR adoption rates among Japanese hospitals. Comparable datasets from the Healthcare Information and Management System Society (HIMSS) and the American Hospital Association (AHA) were utilized to extract EHR adoption rates among U.S. hospitals. The trends of EHR adoption were stratified and analyzed by hospital size and hospital ownership status. As of 2014, the U.S. hospitals had a wider adoption of basic with clinical notes' EHRs compared to Japan (45.6% vs. 27.3%), but large hospitals (400+ beds) in Japan have shown a similar adoption rate of EHR systems than those of U.S. (65.6% vs. 68.5%). Governmental hospitals tend to be more advanced in EHR adoption than non-profit hospitals in Japan (53.0% vs. 21.5%). Non-profit hospitals show the highest adoption rate of basic' EHR systems in the U.S. as of 2014 (63.3%). Using the certified' definition of EHRs, the EHR adoption rate was close to 96% among U.S. hospitals as of 2016; however, updated EHR adoption data from Japanese hospitals has yet to be collected and published. U.S. and Japan have considerably increased EHR adoption among hospitals; however, this analysis indicates different trends of EHR adoption among hospitals by size and ownership status in both countries. Learnings from government programs supporting EHR adoption in the U.S. and Japan can be helpful in planning useful strategies for future hospital-oriented health IT policies in other developed nations.","[Kanakubo, Takako; Kharrazi, Hadi] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, 615 N Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Kharrazi, Hadi] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Ctr Populat Hlth IT, 624 N Broadway, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Kharrazi, H (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, 615 N Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.;Kharrazi, H (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Ctr Populat Hlth IT, 624 N Broadway, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",tkanaku1@jhu.edu; kharrazi@jhu.edu,"Kharrazi, Hadi/Q-1725-2015","Kharrazi, Hadi/0000-0003-1481-4323",,,"Adler-Milstein J, 2017, J AM MED INFORM ASSN, V24, P1036, DOI 10.1093/jamia/ocx01; Adler-Milstein J, 2015, HEALTH AFFAIR, V34, P2174, DOI 10.1377/hlthaff.2015.099; American Hospital Association, 2017, FAST FACTS US HOSP ; American Hospital Association, AHA DAT DI; [Anonymous], 2015, 2015 COMM FUND INT ; Blumenthal D., 2006, HLTH INFORM TECHNOL; Blumenthal D, 2010, NEW ENGL J MED, V363, P501, DOI 10.1056/NEJMp100611; Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, EL HLTH REC EHR IN; Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, STAG 3 PROGR REQ PR; Chan KS, 2016, AM J MANAG CARE, V22, pE40; Chang HY, 2017, MED CARE, V55, P1052, DOI 10.1097/MLR.000000000000082; Dixon B E, 2015, Yearb Med Inform, V10, P199, DOI 10.15265/IY-2015-01; Dixon Brian E, 2015, Online J Public Health Inform, V7, pe216, DOI 10.5210/ojphi.v7i2.593; Gamache Roland, 2018, Yearb Med Inform, V27, P199, DOI 10.1055/s-0038-166708; H Shimada, 2007, JAPAN HIT CASE STUD; Hatef E, 2019, INT J MED INFORM, V124, P86, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.01.01; Hatef E, 2018, POPUL HEALTH MANAG, V21, P261, DOI 10.1089/pop.2017.011; Hatef Elham, 2017, Online J Public Health Inform, V9, pe195, DOI 10.5210/ojphi.v9i3.812; Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS), EL MED REC AD MOD E; HIMSS, 2010, EL HLTH REC GLOB PER EL HLTH REC GLOB PE; Ikegami N, 2011, LANCET, V378, P1106, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60828-; Inokuchi R, 2014, AM J EMERG MED, V32, P725, DOI 10.1016/j.ajem.2014.03.03; Jamoom EW, 2014, HEALTHCARE, V2, P33, DOI 10.1016/j.hjdsi.2013.12.00; Japan Hospital Association, LIST MEM; Japan Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare., RES PROG; Japan Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare., SURV MED ; Japan Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare., FAC INF HEALTHC FIE; Japan Ministry of Health Labour and welfare., 2001, GRAND DES DEV INF S; Japan Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare., OV RES PROG; Japan Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, CAT LOC GO; Jha A., 2011, AM J MANAGED CARE, V1; Jha AK, 2009, NEW ENGL J MED, V360, P1628, DOI 10.1056/NEJMsa090059; Kharrazi H, 2018, MED CARE, V56, P1042, DOI 10.1097/MLR.000000000000100; Kharrazi H, 2018, J MED INTERNET RES, V20, DOI 10.2196/1045; Kharrazi H, 2018, MED CARE, V56, P202, DOI 10.1097/MLR.000000000000084; Kharrazi H, 2017, MED CARE, V55, P789, DOI 10.1097/MLR.000000000000075; Kharrazi H, 2017, J AM MED INFORM ASSN, V24, P2, DOI 10.1093/jamia/ocv21; Kharrazi Hadi, 2014, EGEMS (Wash DC), V2, P1117, DOI 10.13063/2327-9214.111; Kim YG, 2017, INT J MED INFORM, V101, P100, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.02.00; Kimura M, 2011, METHOD INFORM MED, V50, P131, DOI 10.3414/ME10-01-001; Lemke KW, 2018, AM J MANAG CARE, V24, pE19; National Hospital Organization [Japan], PROJ EST IT INFR ST; OECD, LENGTH HOSP STA; Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology Office of the Secretary United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2016, 2016 REP C HLTH IT ; Samarath A, 2016, MEASUREMENT INTEROP; Stone CP, 2014, GLIMPSE EHR IMPLEME; Tanaka H, 2007, JAP MED ASS J, V50, P39; The Commonwealth Fund, 2012, SURV PRIM CAR DOCT ; The Commonwealth Fund, 2015, 2015 INT SURV PHY; The Commonwealth Fund, 2016, WHAT IS STAT EL HLT; The Consortium for SS-MIX Dissemination and Promotion, SS MIX; The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, 2016, NON FED AC CAR HOS; The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, MEAN US DEF OB; The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, 2017, PROP INT STAND MEA; The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, HLTH IT STRAT PLAN; The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, CONN HLTH CAR NAT SH CONN HLTH CAR NAT S; The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, 2016, AD EL HLTH REC SYS; The Sequoia Project, SEQ PRO; United States Census Bureau, METR MICR GLOS; Yoshida Y, 2013, INT J MED INFORM, V82, P1004, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2013.07.00",60,8,8,5,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In the last few years, the number of psychological disorders patients has been significantly raised. This paper presents a comprehensive review of some of the major human psychological disorders (stress, depression, autism, anxiety, Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer, Parkinson, insomnia, schizophrenia and mood disorder) mined using different supervised and nature-inspired computing techniques. A systematic review methodology based on three-dimensional search space i.e. disease diagnosis, psychological disorders and classification techniques has been employed. This study reviews the discipline, models, and methodologies used to diagnose different psychological disorders. Initially, different types of human psychological disorders along with their biological and behavioural symptoms have been presented. The racial effects on these human disorders have been briefly explored. The morbidity rate of psychological disordered Indian patients has also been depicted. The significance of using different supervised learning and nature-inspired computing techniques in the diagnosis of different psychological disorders has been extensively examined and the publication trend of the related articles has also been comprehensively accessed. The brief details of the datasets used in mining these human disorders have also been shown. In addition, the effect of using feature selection on the predictive rate of accuracy of these human disorders is also presented in this study. Finally, the research gaps have been identified that witnessed that there is a full scope for diagnosis of mania, insomnia, mood disorder using emerging nature-inspired computing techniques. Moreover, there is a need to explore the use of a binary or chaotic variant of different nature-inspired computing techniques in the diagnosis of different human psychological disorders. This study will serve as a roadmap to guide the researchers who want to pursue their research work in the mining of different psychological disorders.","[Kaur, Prableen; Sharma, Manik] DAV Univ, Dept CSA, Jalandhar, Punjab, India","Sharma, M (corresponding author), DAV Univ, Dept CSA, Jalandhar, Punjab, India.",manik_sharma25@yahoo.com,"Sharma, Manik/L-2796-2018","Sharma, Manik/0000-0002-5942-134X",,,"Abibullaev B, 2012, J MED SYST, V36, P2675, DOI 10.1007/s10916-011-9742-; Ahn WK, 2009, COGNITIVE SCI, V33, P147, DOI 10.1111/j.1551-6709.2009.01008.; Al-Fatlawi AH, 2016, IEEE C EVOL COMPUTAT, P1324, DOI 10.1109/CEC.2016.774394; Algunaid RF, 2018, BIOMED SIGNAL PROCES, V43, P289, DOI 10.1016/j.bspc.2018.02.01; [Anonymous], [No title captured; [Anonymous], 2017, J APPL COMPUTAT MAT; [Anonymous], 2017, J APPL ENVIRON BIO; [Anonymous], [No title captured; [Anonymous], 2013, DSM; Antony MM., 2020, TRANSDIAGNOSTIC ASSE, V3, P11; Arora S, 2019, IEEE ACCESS, V7, P26343, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.289732; Bae Y, 2018, J DIGIT IMAGING, V31, P252, DOI 10.1007/s10278-017-0020-; Benyoussef E, 2017, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V10542, P619, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-68179-5_5; Billiard M, 2011, SLEEP MED REV, V15, P247, DOI 10.1016/j.smrv.2010.08.00; Brewin CR, 2010, PSYCHOL REV, V117, P210, DOI 10.1037/a001811; Chandrashekar G, 2014, COMPUT ELECTR ENG, V40, P16, DOI 10.1016/j.compeleceng.2013.11.02; Chaovalitwongse WA, 2011, IEEE T SYST MAN CY A, V41, P977, DOI 10.1109/TSMCA.2011.210611; Daimi K., 2014, INT J PUBLIC HLTH SC, V3, P23; Dipnall JF, 2016, PLOS ONE, V11, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.014819; Dorigo M., 1997, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, V1, P53, DOI 10.1109/4235.58589; Doyle OM, 2014, PLOS ONE, V9, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.010554; Feizollah A, 2015, DIGIT INVEST, V13, P22, DOI 10.1016/j.diin.2015.02.00; Geem ZW, 2001, SIMULATION, V76, P60, DOI 10.1177/00375497010760020; Gilbert JA, 2013, CELL, V155, P1446, DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2013.11.03; Gorunescu F, 2011, INTEL SYST REF LIBR, P1, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-19721-; Grossi E, 2017, COMPUT METH PROG BIO, V142, P73, DOI 10.1016/j.cmpb.2017.02.00; Gupta D, 2018, COGN SYST RES, V52, P36, DOI 10.1016/j.cogsys.2018.06.00; Gupta D, 2018, COMPUT ELECTR ENG, V68, P412, DOI 10.1016/j.compeleceng.2018.04.01; Hariharan M, 2014, COMPUT METH PROG BIO, V113, P904, DOI 10.1016/j.cmpb.2014.01.00; Hiesh MH, 2013, IEEE ENG MED BIO, P6047, DOI 10.1109/EMBC.2013.661093; Holland JH., 1992, ADAPTATION NATURAL ; Hosseini HS, 2007, 2007 IEEE C EV COM; Hosseinifard B, 2013, COMPUT METH PROG BIO, V109, P339, DOI 10.1016/j.cmpb.2012.10.00; Huang QR, 2008, J CLIN SLEEP MED, V4, P54; JANGIR P, 2017, INT J ENG TECHNOLOGY, V0001, P0002; Jiawei H., 2013, DATA MINING CONCEPT; Johnson P, 2014, BMC BIOINFORMATICS, V15, DOI 10.1186/1471-2105-15-S16-S1; Karaboga D, 2011, APPL SOFT COMPUT, V11, P652, DOI 10.1016/j.asoc.2009.12.02; Kaur P, 2017, INT J INF SYST MODEL, V8, P70, DOI 10.4018/IJISMD.201704010; Kennedy J., 1995, P IEEE ICNN95 INT ; Kim JK, 2015, J ANAL METHODS CHEM, V2015, DOI 10.1155/2015/91634; Koikkalainen J, 2012, PLOS ONE, V7, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.003111; Krishnanand K.

One of the important factors in the successful implementation of a PACS system is identifying and prioritizing the challenges from the perspectives of involved staff and user of this system. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine and compare the challenges of implementing PACS from perspectives these users in educational hospitals. This study was conducted on all IT and medical equipment staff, and radiology residents (n=140) in Kerman University of Medical Sciences (KUMS) and Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (SUMS) in 2016. The data were collected through two researcher-made questionnaires. Their validity was approved by radiologists, IT staff, and medical informatics specialists and their reliability through calculation of Cronbach's Alpha (0.969 and 0.795). We used Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) to compare the scores given by three groups of participants in the challenges and Univariate Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to compare the scores in two universities. The participants believed that technical challenges were more important than other challenges (x=3.74, SD=0.7). IT experts (x=3.87, SD=1) and radiology residents (x=3.95, SD=0.9) gave the higher scores to the shortage of high quality monitors factor and medical equipment experts (x=4.26, SD=0.87) to the low speed of communication networks factor among all technical challenges. The mean scores given to technical (x=76.1, SD=13.5) and managerial (x=16, SD=5.9) challenges in SUMS were more than the scores of the same challenges in KUMS (x=69.9, SD=15.7) and (x=11.9, SD=6.4) (p<0.05). The technical challenges are the most common challenges to PACS implementation, and different universities experience different levels of technical challenges. Eliminating implementation challenges can reduce the risk of failure in the utilization process. Based on the results of this study, providing necessary infrastructures such as appropriate monitors and upgraded IT equipment can prevent many of the PACS implementation challenges.","[Khajouei, Reza] Kerman Univ Med Sci, Inst Future Studies Hlth, Med Informat Res Ctr, Kerman, Iran;

Currently, machine learning (ML) models are being constructed on local healthcare systems and are validated internally with no expectation that they would validate externally and thus, are rarely transferrable to a different healthcare system. In this work, we aim to demonstrate that (1) even a complex ML model built on a national cohort can be transferred to two local healthcare systems, (2) while a model constructed on a local healthcare system's cohort is difficult to transfer; (3) we examine the impact of training cohort size on the transferability; and (4) we discuss criteria for external validity. We built a model using our previously published Multi-Task Learning-based methodology on a national cohort extracted from OptumLabs (R) Data Warehouse and transferred the model to two local healthcare systems (i.e., University of Minnesota Medical Center and Mayo Clinic) for external evaluation. The model remained valid when applied to the local patient populations and performed as well as locally constructed models (concordance: .73-.92), demonstrating transferability. The performance of the locally constructed models reduced substantially when applied to each other's healthcare system (concordance: .62-.90). We believe that our modeling approach, in which a model is learned from a national cohort and is externally validated, produces a transferable model, allowing patients at smaller healthcare systems to benefit from precision medicine.","[Kim, Era; Pieczkiewicz, David S.; Simon, Gyorgy J.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Hlth Informat, 8-100 Phillips Wangensteen Bldg, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Caraballo, Pedro J.] Mayo Clin, Dept Med, Div Gen Internal Med, Rochester, MN USA; [Caraballo, Pedro J.] Mayo Clin, Ctr Translat Informat & Knowledge Management, Rochester, MN USA; [Castro, M.

In order to achieve the regional medical and public health data analysis through artificial intelligence technologies, spark data analysis is adopted as the research platform for hypertension patients, and artificial intelligence technologies are used to preprocess the data with inconsistency, redundancy, incompleteness, noise and error; Aiming at the unbalanced data sets, the Z-score standard is adopted to convert data into usable form suitable for data mining. And, the application of Logistic, Naive Bayesian regression, and support vector machine based on three groups of different prognosis in severe cases, including stroke, heart failure and renal failure symptoms, establish the risk early warning model for 3years time. In addition, to select the optimal feature subset based on medicine big-data features, the model simplification and optimization are done in training process, the experimental results show that the feature subset selection can ensure the classification performance similar to the clinical features of the model. Therefore, according to chronic cardiovascular disease, acute cardiovascular events and cardiovascular events caused by critical illness events, we screen out the relevant prognosis of serious illness (stroke, heart failure, renal failure), which is related to the prognosis of serious illness. Targeted prevention has a guiding role and practical significance according to the results of artificial intelligence analysis.","[Li, Bin; Song, Guolei; Li, Jiajia; Zhang, Qian] Bengbu Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp 1, Bengbu 233004, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Li, Bin; Ding, Shuai] HeFei Univ Technol, Sch Management, Hefei 230009, Anhui, Peoples R China","Li, B (corresponding author), Bengbu Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp 1, Bengbu 233004, Anhui, Peoples R China.;Li, B (corresponding author), HeFei Univ Technol, Sch Management, Hefei 230009, Anhui, Peoples R China.",libin2010000@163.com,,,Social Science Key Project of Bengbu Medical College [BYKY17146skZD],This study was funded by 2017 Social Science Key Project of Bengbu Medical College.

To detect false alarm, various inputs are used such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, atrial blood pressure (ABP), photoplethysmogram signals (PLETH) and respiration (RESP). The inputs are given to decision tree predictive learner (DTPL) based classifier for thedetection of false alarm. The proposed method has an accuracy of 97% for prediction of false alarm in ICU. Theresult of the proposed method is promising which suggest that it can be used effectively for false alarm detection in ICUs. To the best of our knowledge, there is no such assumption based classification approach.","[Manna, Tishya; Swetapadma, Aleena] KIIT Univ, Sch Comp Engn, Bhubaneswar, India; [Abdar, Moloud] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Informat, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Swetapadma, A (corresponding author), KIIT Univ, Sch Comp Engn, Bhubaneswar, India.",aleena.swetapadma@gmail.com,"Abdar, Moloud/B-8451-2017; Abdar, Moloud/AAB-3016-2020","Abdar, Moloud/0000-0002-3059-6357",,,"Acharya UR, 2017, INFORM SCIENCES, V405, P81, DOI 10.1016/j.ins.2017.04.01; Amadu AM, 2019, CLIN RADIOL, V74, P228, DOI 10.1016/j.crad.2018.12.00; Baloglu UB, 2019, PATTERN RECOGN LETT, V122, P23, DOI 10.1016/j.patrec.2019.02.01; Caballero M, 2015, COMPUT CARDIOL CONF, V42, P1169, DOI 10.1109/CIC.2015.741112; Chen YL, 2016, INFORM SCIENCES, V354, P140, DOI 10.1016/j.ins.2016.03.02; Chugh SS, 2014, GLOB HEART, V9, P113, DOI 10.1016/j.gheart.2014.01.00; Clifford GD, 2015, COMPUT CARDIOL CONF, V42, P273, DOI 10.1109/CIC.2015.740863; Daluwatte C, 2018, J ELECTROCARDIOL, V51, P68, DOI 10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2017.08.03; Daluwatte C, 2015, COMPUT CARDIOL CONF, V42, P745, DOI 10.1109/CIC.2015.741101; Desai R, 2019, INT J CARDIOL, V281, P49, DOI 10.1016/j.ijcard.2019.01.07; Ding XR, 2016, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V63, P964, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2015.248067; Ding XR, 2017, SCI REP-UK, V7, DOI 10.1038/s41598-017-11507-; Eerikainen LM, 2015, COMPUT CARDIOL CONF, V42, P293, DOI 10.1109/CIC.2015.740864; Fallet S, 2015, COMPUT CARDIOL CONF, V42, P277, DOI 10.1109/CIC.2015.740864; Han Jiawei, DATA MINING CONCEPT; Hu X, 2012, J BIOMED INFORM, V45, P913, DOI 10.1016/j.jbi.2012.03.00; Jain SK, 2017, IEEE T BIOMED CIRC S, V11, P314, DOI 10.1109/TBCAS.2016.259238; Lee K, 2017, IEEE ACCESS, V5, P11437, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.270048; Li Q, 2012, J ELECTROCARDIOL, V45, P596, DOI 10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2012.07.01; Li YJ, 2014, AUSTRALAS PHYS ENG S, V37, P367, DOI 10.1007/s13246-014-0269-; Liu FF, 2018, IEEE ACCESS, V6, P41892, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2018.286005; Liu XQ, 2018, APPL SOFT COMPUT, V62, P807, DOI 10.1016/j.asoc.2017.09.01; Messas E, 2013, Diagn Interv Imaging, V94, P561, DOI 10.1016/j.diii.2013.01.02; Mukkamala R, 2015, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V62, P1879, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2015.244195; Pawiak P., 2019, NOVEL DEEP GENETIC E, DOI [10.1007/s00521-018-03980-2, DOI 10.1007/S00521-018-03980-2; Plawiak P, 2018, SWARM EVOL COMPUT, V39, P192, DOI 10.1016/j.swevo.2017.10.00; Plesinger F, 2015, COMPUT CARDIOL CONF, V42, P281, DOI 10.1109/CIC.2015.740864; Poleszczuk J, 2018, PLOS ONE, V13, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.019097; Qu YR, 2016, PARALLEL COMPUT, V54, P121, DOI 10.1016/j.parco.2015.12.00; Quiroz-Juarez MA, 2018, IEEE T NANOBIOSCI, V17, P525, DOI 10.1109/TNB.2018.287033; Roonizi EK, 2016, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V64, P665, DOI 10.1109/TSP.2015.248959; Rosa SA, 2019, REV PORT CARDIOL, V38, P11, DOI 10.1016/j.repc.2018.05.01; Rundo F, 2018, COMPUTATION, V6, DOI 10.3390/computation603004; Saettler A, 2017, INFORM PROCESS LETT, V127, P27, DOI 10.1016/j.ipl.2017.06.01; Salvetti Antonio, 1996, Blood Pressure, V5, P325, DOI 10.3109/0803705960907806; Satija U, 2018, IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH, V22, P722, DOI 10.1109/JBHI.2017.268643; Serackis A, 2015, COMPUT CARDIOL CONF, V42, P1193, DOI 10.1109/CIC.2015.741113; Siebig S, 2010, J CRIT CARE, V25, P128, DOI 10.1016/j.jcrc.2008.09.00; Solet JM, 2012, PROG PEDIATR CARDIOL, V33, P85, DOI 10.1016/j.ppedcard.2011.12.01; Wang XC, 2015, PATTERN RECOGN, V48, P50, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2014.08.00; Xing XM, 2016, BIOMED OPT EXPRESS, V7, P3007, DOI 10.1364/BOE.7.00300; Yildirim O, 2018, COMPUT BIOL MED, V102, P411, DOI 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2018.09.00; Yildirim O, 2018, COMPUT BIOL MED, V96, P189, DOI 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2018.03.01; Yoon YZ, 2018, IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH, V22, P1068, DOI 10.1109/JBHI.2017.271467; Zaghla H, 2013, EGYPT J CHEST DIS TU, V62, P377, DOI 10.1016/j.ejcdt.2013.05.00; Zong W, 2015, COMPUT CARDIOL CONF, V42, P289, DOI 10.1109/CIC.2015.740864",46,5,5,4,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In many applications of 2D medical imaging, they face problems with speckle noise and object contours. Frequent scanning of fetal leads to clinical disturbances to the fetal growth and the quantitative interpretation of Ultrasonic images also a difficult task compared to other image modalities. In the present work a three-stage hybrid algorithm has been developed to segment the US fetal kidney images for the detection of shape and contour. At the first stage the hybrid Mean Median (Hybrid MM) filter is applied to reduce the speckle noise. Then a kernel based Fuzzy C - means clustering is used to detect the shape and contour. Finally, the texture features are obtained from the segmented images. Based on the obtained texture features, the abnormalities are detected. The Gaussian Radial basis function provides an accuracy of 80% at the second and third trimesters with weighted constant ranging from 4 to 8, compared to other global kernel functions. Similarly the proposed method has an accuracy of 86% with compared to other FCM techniques.","[Meenakshi, S.; Suganthi, M.] Mahendra Coll Engn, Salem 636106, India; [Sureshkumar, P.] Mahendra Engn Coll, Namakkal 637503, India","Meenakshi, S (corresponding author), Mahendra Coll Engn, Salem 636106, India.",meenakshisece@gmail.com,,"perumal, suresh kumar/0000-0002-2453-5929",,,"Bezdek J.

The Gini index isa statistic used in economics to assess difference in the distribution of wealth among groups. We reported a high degree of inequality among hospitals. In this paper, we extend this work by calculating the intragenerational mobility for the hospitals present in 2007-2008 and 2015-2016. Whereas in economics intragenerational mobility often is measured as changes in income over time within a group, we study changes in hospitals' surgical caseloads. Intragenerational mobility was quantified using the Spearman rank correlation, the slope of the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression line in the log scale, and the Shorrocks trace index. The results were consistent across the three measures. There was a low degree of mobility for the surgical caseloads of the hospitals during the 10-year period under study. For example, based on the slope of the OLS regression, intragenerational mobility was not significantly different from zero (P>0.05). None (0%) of the 113 hospitals with at least 10 cases both periods increased from the 1st to 5th quintile, 1st to 4th quintile, 2nd to 5th quintile, 2nd to 4th quintile, or even from 3rd to 5th quintile.

It can be applied in numerous application areas such as medical, remote sensing, computer vision etc. Brain tumor is caused due to formation of abnormal tissues within human brain. Therefore, it is necessary to remove affected tumor part from the brain securely. Among various medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) employs a vital role to generate images of internal parts of human body. Image segmentation is one of the challenging tasks in today's medical field. An effective segmentation using MRI slices can help to identifying the tumor with its actual size and shape. To meet this requirement, a novel method called Adaptive Convex Region Contour (ACRC) algorithm is presented. Here, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is utilized for slice classification whether it is normal or abnormal. After obtaining SVM results, abnormal slices are involved in segmentation process. Since, human body is having complicated 3D anatomical structure naturally. Unfortunately, MRI slices are yields only 2Dimensional images. The actual shape of tumor cannot be clearly visualized in 2D form. Hence, transformation from 2D to 3D is essential which helps the doctors during surgery. The Rapid Mode Image Matching (RMIM) algorithm has to be followed for 3D reconstruction modeling. After building 3D model, the original volume of the tumor is estimated. The precise experimentation was implemented in MATLAB simulation environment. The obtained results are confirmed that proposed method has better accurate results compared to existing methods.","[Pandiselvi, T.] Kamaraj Coll Engn & Technol, Dept ECE, Virudunagar, Tamil Nadu, India; [Maheswaran, R.] Mepco Schlenk Engn Coll, Dept Mech Engn, Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu, India","Pandiselvi, T (corresponding author), Kamaraj Coll Engn & Technol, Dept ECE, Virudunagar, Tamil Nadu, India.",pandskt@gmail.com; rmaheshin@yahoo.com,"Maheswaran, Rathinam/AAO-5645-2020","Maheswaran, Rathinam/0000-0001-5594-703X",,,"Amar Tej G., 2015, INT J ADV RES COMPUT, V4, P; Anandgaonkar G.

Regular screening system help in detecting the early symptoms like exudates, which are due to the leakage of blood pressure of vessels. The significant role of proposed system is detecting the hard exudates in prevention of visual loss and blindness. Many researchers studied and investigated about detecting the exudates region but not satisfied with their results. Fundamental medical image processing steps with different techniques are implemented by the proposed system. Random Forest is a novel classification which is applied on color retinal images able to classify cluster of data with high accuracy. The performance of the proposed system is obtained by analyzing the accuracy obtained from the Random Forest classifier. These images are obtained from Diabetic Retinopathy Database (DIARETDB) database. The simulation results are obtained with the help of MATLAB 2018. By applying novel classification techniques improves the automatic detection of hard exudates from color retinal images. The achieved accuracy is compared with existing classifiers since the proposed Random Forest classifier provides the accuracy of 99.89% applied on color retinal images.","[Pratheeba, C.] Udaya Sch Engn, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Vellamodi, India; [Singh, N.

The majority of the intelligent schemes proposed for detecting the breast cancer relies on the human skill that helps in trustworthy determination of essential pattern that confirms the existence of the infected cancer cells for deciding upon the course of treatment. Further, most of the research works contributed in the literature for detecting breast cancer necessitates huge time and laborinvolved that increases the time of diagnosis. This Intelligent Artificial Bee Colony and Enhanced Monarchy Butterfly Optimization Technique (IABC-EMBOT) is proposed for effective breast cancer diagnosis. The core idea behind the formulation of IABC-EMBOT relies on two significant ameliorations that, i) focuses on the modification of Monarchy Butterfly Optimization that enhances the exploration degree based on the rate of exploitation of the searching space and ii) concentrates on the elimination in the limitations of the ABC scheme by enhancing the possibility of search diversification process through phenomenal update facilitated through the dynamic and adaptive butterfly operator that improves the search globally. The proposed IABC-EMBOT scheme investigated using the Wisconsin data set is proven to facilitate an improved average classification accuracy of 97.53%.","[Punitha, S.; Joseph, K.

However, the diversity of procedures, staff, and patients present important challenges for staff collaboration. The complexity of flows between tasks and places, such as interconnections between pre-operation, post-operation and intensive care units, led previous research to address these issues separately using checklists, scheduling, or specialized human-computer interfaces. Approaches to treat the surgical suite as a whole entity have not been explored yet. Here, we build upon a cyber-physical system comprising an electronic whiteboard and different sensors tracking the status of operating rooms to design a continuum of mobile and fixed, shared computer interfaces. The interfaces disseminate the information through different locations and devices and allow for its manipulation in order to foster appropriate collaboration on unforeseen events and decisions.

This study aimed to assess the agreement between the Apple Watch photoplethysmography sensor and a criterion, for measuring heart rate across a range of intensities during exercise and to determine the influence of skin type on the accuracy of the measure. Forty-five males (20-43 y) completed the Fitzpatrick Skin Scale and were classified into three different skin type groups: a) types II (n=15), III (n=15) and IV (n=15). Participants performed a graded incremental cycle-ergometer test while simultaneously wearing the Apple Watch and a Polar monitor as a criterion measure. Data from both devices were collected in 5-s epochs. Correlations between devices were very good (0.96-0.99 [95%CI: 0.94 to 0.99]). Significant differences were observed between skin types II and III when the intensity of the exercise was increased, albeit with trivial to small effect sizes (ES: 0.05 to 0.28). All significant differences corresponded to <2% of relative difference between both devices. Bland-Altman analyses showed a trivial but systematic underestimation of HR in the Apple Watch compared to Polar for all skin types during exercise. In conclusion, the Apple Watch accurately measures HR when cycling at different intensities and certain types of skin seem not to influence these measures, which may have important implications for controlling the intensity of exercise.","[Sanudo, Borja; De Hoyo, Moises] Univ Seville, Dept Phys Educ & Sport, Pirotecnia S-N, E-41012 Seville, Spain; [Munoz-Lopez, Alejandro] Univ Seville, Human Motric & Performance Area, Seville, Spain; [Perry, John] Mary Immaculate Coll, Dept Psychol, Limerick, Ireland; [Abt, Grant] Univ Hull, Dept Sport Hlth & Exercise Sci, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England","Sanudo, B (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Dept Phys Educ & Sport, Pirotecnia S-N, E-41012 Seville, Spain.",bsancor@us.es,"Sañudo, Borja/E-6280-2010; Perry, John/J-9546-2019; López, Alejandro Muñoz/S-6986-2019; Hoyo Lora, Moises de/Q-9649-2017","Sañudo, Borja/0000-0002-9969-9573; Perry, John/0000-0002-7284-9252; López, Alejandro Muñoz/0000-0003-1206-8697; Hoyo Lora, Moises de/0000-0003-1855-4012; Abt, Grant/0000-0002-4079-9270",,,"Allen J, 2007, PHYSIOL MEAS, V28, pR1, DOI 10.1088/0967-3334/28/3/R0; Atkinson G, 1998, SPORTS MED, V26, P217, DOI 10.2165/00007256-199826040-0000; Bland JM, 2007, J BIOPHARM STAT, V17, P571, DOI 10.1080/1054340070132942; Butler MJ, 2016, PHYSIOL MEAS, V37, pN27, DOI 10.1088/0967-3334/37/5/N2; Barbosa MPDD, 2016, CLIN PHYSIOL FUNCT I, V36, P112, DOI 10.1111/cpf.1220; Dooley Erin E, 2017, JMIR Mhealth Uhealth, V5, pe34, DOI 10.2196/mhealth.704; Fallow BA, 2013, J CLIN MONIT COMPUT, V27, P313, DOI 10.1007/s10877-013-9436-; FITZPATRICK TB, 1988, ARCH DERMATOL, V124, P869, DOI 10.1001/archderm.124.6.86; Giles D, 2016, EUR J APPL PHYSIOL, V116, P563, DOI 10.1007/s00421-015-3303-; Hopkins W., 2016, P 21 ANN C EUR COL; Hopkins WG, 2009, MED SCI SPORT EXER, V41, P3, DOI 10.1249/MSS.0b013e31818cb27; Jo E, 2016, J SPORT SCI MED, V15, P54; Kamshilin AA, 2015, BIOMED OPT EXPRESS, V6, P4326, DOI 10.1364/BOE.6.00432; Khushhal Alaa, 2017, Sports Med Int Open, V1, pE206, DOI 10.1055/s-0043-12019; Lee CM, 2011, MEAS PHYS EDUC EXERC, V15, P18, DOI 10.1080/1091367X.2011.53908; Maeda Y, 2011, J MED SYST, V35, P969, DOI 10.1007/s10916-010-9505-; Mohan P.

The utilization of microarray gene data is increasing now-a-days, owing to the advancement of medical science. Microarray gene data helps in diagnosing diseases quite accurately. However, processing microarray gene data is difficult and is usually not understandable. Taking this challenge into account, this work presents a user-friendly rule based classification model, which is easily understandable and does not demand users to have prior knowledge. The classification rules are formed with the help of cuckoo search optimization algorithm and the rules are pruned by the associative rule mining. Finally, the classification is performed with the help of the pruned rules. The performance of the proposed approach is satisfactory in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and time consumption.","[Scaria, Thomas] St Pius X Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Kasaragod, Kerala, India; [Christopher, T.] Govt Arts Coll, PG & Res Dept Informat Technol, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India","Scaria, T (corresponding author), St Pius X Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Kasaragod, Kerala, India.",lttscaria.19@gmail.com,,,,,"Alizadeh AA, 2000, NATURE, V403, P503, DOI 10.1038/3500050; Alon U, 1999, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V96, P6745, DOI 10.1073/pnas.96.12.674; Alshamlan Hala M., 2016, International Journal of Machine Learning and Computing, V6, P184, DOI 10.18178/ijmlc.2016.6.3.59; Alshamlan HM, 2015, COMPUT BIOL CHEM, V56, P49, DOI 10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2015.03.00; An S, 2018, IEEE ACM T COMPUT BI, V15, P1538, DOI 10.1109/TCBB.2017.271277; Armstrong SA, 2002, NAT GENET, V30, P41, DOI 10.1038/ng76; Beer DG, 2002, NAT MED, V8, P816, DOI 10.1038/nm73; Christopher T, 2018, INT J ADV INTELLIGE; Farahani S., 2014, [Дальневосточный Энтомолог, Far Eastern Entomologist, Dal'nevostochnyi Entomolog], P; Gangeh MJ, 2017, IEEE ACM T COMPUT BI, V14, P167, DOI 10.1109/TCBB.2016.263116; Golub TR, 1999, SCIENCE, V286, P531, DOI 10.1126/science.286.5439.53; Guney H, 2018, ELECTRON LETT, V54, DOI 10.1049/el.2017.455; Harvey BS, 2017, IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH, V21, P238, DOI 10.1109/JBHI.2015.249632; Hsieh SY, 2016, IEEE ACM T COMPUT BI, V13, P43, DOI 10.1109/TCBB.2015.247438; Karakas F, 2011, KONA POWDER PART J, P9; Katsigiannis S, 2017, IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH, V21, P867, DOI 10.1109/JBHI.2016.253792; Khan J, 2001, NAT MED, V7, P673, DOI 10.1038/8904; Li JQ, 2017, IEEE ACM T COMPUT BI, V14, P514, DOI 10.1109/TCBB.2016.259154; Li JT, 2018, IEEE ACM T COMPUT BI, V15, P2028, DOI 10.1109/TCBB.2017.276187; Maji P, 2017, IEEE ACM T COMPUT BI, V14, P1419, DOI 10.1109/TCBB.2016.259816; Manikandan V., 2018, ICTACT J SOFT COMPUT, V9, P1806, DOI [10.21917/ ijsc.2018.0252, DOI 10.21917/IJSC.2018.0252; Pati J, 2019, IEEE ACCESS, V7, P4232, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2018.288660; Scaria Thomas, 2018, International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications, V10, P9, DOI 10.5815/ijisa.2018.01.0; Wu HC, 2018, IEEE ACM T COMPUT BI, V15, P2039, DOI 10.1109/TCBB.2017.276082; Yang XS., 2008, NATURE INSPIRED META, P12; Yu Z, 2017, IEEE T NANOBIOSCI, V16, P21, DOI 10.1109/TNB.2016.263624; Zhang DJ, 2018, IEEE ACCESS, V6, P28936, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2018.283765; Zhang L, 2017, IEEE ACM T COMPUT BI, V14, P145, DOI 10.1109/TCBB.2015.251175",28,1,1,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Thus, lesion segmentation method is an essential technique of pattern recognition algorithms to detect the melanoma skin cancer in patients at earliest stage, otherwise, in further stages it becomes one of the deadliest disease and its mortality rate is very high. Therefore, a precise melanoma segmentation technique is introduced based on the Gradient and Feature Adaptive Contour (GFAC) model to detect melanoma skin cancer in earliest stage and diagnosis of dermoscopic images. In the proposed image segmentation technique pre-processing and noise elimination techniques are introduced to decrease noise and make execution faster. This technique helps in separating the required entity from the background and gather the information from the adjacent pixels of similar classes. Multiple Gaussian distributed patterns are adopted to extract efficient features and to get precise segmentation. The proposed GFACmodel is noise free and consist of smoother border. The segmentation model efficiency is tested on PH2 dataset. The superiority of the proposed modified gradient and feature adaptive contour model can be verified against various state-of-art-techniques in terms of segmented image, error reduction and efficient feature extraction.","[Sreelatha, Tammineni; Prasad, M.

Recent advancements in mobile health has made mobile apps a feasible method of delivering population-based, self-management interventions to address SCI-specific secondary complications. The objective of this study is to describe stakeholder perspectives on the development of a functional mobile app to facilitate self-management skills needed to prevent secondary complications following recent SCI during inpatient rehabilitation. A user-centered design approach was used that involved an evolving mobile app and the collection of prospective qualitative data. Stakeholders from three groups were enrolled in the study: individuals admitted for rehabilitation following SCI (n=20) and informal (n=7) and formal (n=48) caregivers. Iterative feedback was gathered from rehabilitation inpatients during ongoing interactions and via post-discharge exit questionnaires, from informal caregivers via one-on-one interviews, and from formal caregivers via series of focus groups at various phases throughout the design process. Three main themes emerged from the analysis: (1) being individualized and user friendly (i.e., developing an app that is simple and easy to use to facilitate universal uptake), (2) targeting goals to promote self-management (i.e., adopting self-management skills relative to personal goals and confidence), and (3) increasing participation and support-seeking to facilitate lifestyle change (i.e., encouraging leisure activities to facilitate community integration). Key stakeholder perspectives contributed to the development of a self-management mobile app that will be evaluated in future research.","[Ben Mortenson, W.; Singh, Gurkaran; MacGillivray, Megan; Sawatzky, Bonita] Int Collaborat Repair Discoveries, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Ben Mortenson, W.; Mills, Patricia] GF Strong Rehabil Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Ben Mortenson, W.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Med, Dept Occupat Sci & Occupat Therapy, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Singh, Gurkaran; MacGillivray, Megan] Univ British Columbia, Fac Med, Rehabil Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Sadeghi, Mahsa] Wayne State Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Detroit, MI USA; [Sadeghi, Mahsa] Detroit Med Ctr, Detroit, MI USA; [Mills, Patricia] Univ British Columbia, Fac Med, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Adams, Jared] Self Care Catalysts Inc, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Sawatzky, Bonita] Univ British Columbia, Fac Med, Dept Orthopaed, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Ben Mortenson, W (corresponding author), Int Collaborat Repair Discoveries, Vancouver, BC, Canada.;Ben Mortenson, W (corresponding author), GF Strong Rehabil Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada.;Ben Mortenson, W (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Med, Dept Occupat Sci & Occupat Therapy, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",ben.mortenson@ubc.ca,"Singh, Gurkaran/AAD-2338-2021; Mortenson, W.

Variables of rate of perceived exertion, blood glucose, blood lactate, lower body muscular strength manifestation, cortical arousal, specific fine motor skills, autonomic modulation, state anxiety, and memory and attention through a postmission questionnaire were analyzed before and after a combat simulation in 15 experienced soldiers of a special operation unit and 20 non-experienced soldiers of light infantry unit from the Spanish Army. The stress of combat simulation produces a significant increase (p<0.05) in rated perceived exertion, blood glucose, blood lactate, somatic anxiety and a low frequency domain of the heart rate, and a significant decrease of rifle magazine reload time, high frequency domain of the heart rate and somatic anxiety in both groups. The variables of RPE, glucose, CFFT, RMRT, RMSSD, LF/HF, CA, SA and STAI were significantly different in experienced soldiers shown the activation of fight-flight system. The anticipatory anxiety in experienced soldiers shows a cognitive behavioral association by past experiences. The analysis of correct response in the postmission questionnaire show elements more related with the sight and that endanger the physical integrity of soldiers are more remembered, and some significant differences (p<0.05) in the memory performance of experienced soldiers and non experienced soldiers where experienced soldiers shown a better performance. As conclusion, combat stress produce an increase in the psichophysiological response of soldiers independently of experience, but experienced ones presented a lower negative effect on memory than non experienced.","[Delgado-Moreno, Rosa; Juan Robles-Perez, Jose] Study Ctr Appl Combat CESCA, Toledo, Spain; [Delgado-Moreno, Rosa; Javier Clemente-Suarez, Vicente] Univ Europea Madrid, Fac Sport Sci, Villaviciosa De Odon, Spain; [Juan Robles-Perez, Jose] Light Forces Head Quarter Spanish Army, Madrid, Spain; [Aznar-Lain, Susana] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Sports Sci, PAFS Res Grp, Toledo, Spain; [Javier Clemente-Suarez, Vicente] Univ Costa, Grp Invest Cultura Educ & Soc, Barranquilla, Colombia","Delgado-Moreno, R (corresponding author), Study Ctr Appl Combat CESCA, Toledo, Spain.;Delgado-Moreno, R (corresponding author), Univ Europea Madrid, Fac Sport Sci, Villaviciosa De Odon, Spain.",rosa.delgado.moreno@gmail.com,"Aznar, Susana/AAD-9999-2021; Clemente-Suarez, Vicente Javier/K-7980-2014","Clemente-Suarez, Vicente Javier/0000-0002-2397-2801",,,"Aglioti SM, 2008, NAT NEUROSCI, V11, P1109, DOI 10.1038/nn.218; Fernandez EMA, 2007, PSICOTHEMA, V19, P15; Barsegyan A, 2010, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V107, P16655, DOI 10.1073/pnas.101197510; Belenky G, 2000, PENNINGTON CTR NUTR, V1; BORG G, 1970, Scandinavian Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine, V2, P9; Clemente Suárez V.J., 2012, Sanid.

According to deep learning model, a novel brain tumor segmentation method is developed by integrating fully convolutional neural networks (FCNN) and dense micro-block difference feature (DMDF) into a unified framework so as to obtain segmentation results with appearance and spatial consistency. Firstly, we propose a local feature to describe the rotation invariant property of the texture. In order to deal with the change of rotation and scale in texture image, Fisher vector encoding method is used to analyze the texture feature, which can combine with the scale information without increasing the dimension of the local feature. The obtained local features have strong robustness to rotation and gray intensity variation. Then, the non-quantifiable local feature is fused to the FCNN to perform fine boundary segmentation. Since brain tumors occupy a small portion of the image, deconvolutional layers are designed with skip connections to obtain a high quality feature map. Compared with the traditional MRI brain tumor segmentation methods, the experimental results show that the segmentation accuracy and stability has been greatly improved. Average Dice index can be up to 90.98%. And the proposed method has very high real-time performance, where brain tumor image can segment within 1s.","[Deng, Wu; Shi, Qinke; Luo, Kai; Yang, Yi] Sichuan Univ, Informat Ctr, West China Hosp, Chengdu 610000, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Ning, Ning] Sichuan Univ, Dept Orthopaed, West China Hosp, Chengdu 610000, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Ning, N (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Dept Orthopaed, West China Hosp, Chengdu 610000, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",dengwu@wchscu.cn; shiqingke@wchscu.cn; luokai@wchscu.cn; yangyi@wchscu.cn; gkningning@126.com,,,,,"Agn M., 2016, BRAIN TUMOR SEGMENT; Ali N., 2016, REV MRI BASED BRAI; Cabria I, 2017, INFORM FUSION, V36, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.inffus.2016.10.00; Calonder M, 2010, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V6314, P778, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-15561-1_5; Chang P.

The retinal landmarks namely Optic disc is predicted and masked to decrease the false positive in the exudates detection. The abnormalities like Exudates, Microaneurysms and Hemorrhages are segmented to classify the various stages of DR. The proposed approach is employed to separate the landmarks of retina and lesions of retina for the classification of stages of DR. The segmentation algorithms like Gabor double-sided hysteresis thresholding, maximum intensity variation, inverse surface adaptive thresholding, multi-agent approach and toboggan segmentation are used to detect and segment BVs, ODs, EXs, MAs and HAs. The feature vector formation and machine learning algorithm used to classify the various stages of DR are evaluated using images available in various retinal databases, and their performance measures are presented in this paper.","[Karkuzhali, S.] Kalasalingam Acad Res & Educ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Srivilliputtur, Tamil Nadu, India; [Manimegalai, D.] Natl Engn Coll, Dept Informat Technol, Kovilpatti, Tamil Nadu, India","Karkuzhali, S (corresponding author), Kalasalingam Acad Res & Educ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Srivilliputtur, Tamil Nadu, India.",vijikarkuzhali@gmail.com; megalai_nec@yahoo.co.in,"S, Karkuzhali/ABD-2067-2021","S, Karkuzhali/0000-0002-1907-008X",,,"Acharya UR, 2016, COMPUT BIOL MED, V75, P54, DOI 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.04.01; Acharya UR, 2016, COMPUT BIOL MED, V73, P131, DOI 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.04.00; Akram MU, 2013, PATTERN RECOGN, V46, P107, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2012.07.00; Al Saadi, 2013, J COMPUT SCI, V9, P1389, DOI DOI 10.3844/JCSSP.2013.1389.139; Decenciere E, 2014, IMAGE ANAL STEREOL, V33, P231, DOI 10.5566/ias.115; Dua S, 2012, IEEE T INF TECHNOL B, V16, P80, DOI 10.1109/TITB.2011.217654; Figueiredo IN, 2015, COMPUT BIOL MED, V66, P47, DOI 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2015.08.00; Hoover A, 2000, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V19, P203, DOI 10.1109/42.84517; Imani E, 2015, COMPUT MED IMAG GRAP, V43, P78, DOI 10.1016/j.compmedimag.2015.03.00; Kauppi T, 2007, DIARETDB1 STANDARD ; Kauppi T, 2006, DIARETDB0 EVALUATION, P13; Kumar SJJ, 2012, J MED SYST, V36, P3573, DOI 10.1007/s10916-012-9833-; Madheswaran M., 2012, ICTACT Journal on Image and Video Processing, V3, P50; Mahendran G, 2015, COMPUT ELECTR ENG, V45, P312, DOI 10.1016/j.compeleceng.2015.01.01; Mookiah MRK, 2013, KNOWL-BASED SYST, V39, P9, DOI 10.1016/j.knosys.2012.09.00; Olson JL, 2015, COMPUT BIOL MED, V58, P154, DOI 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2014.12.02; Saleh MD, 2012, COMPUT METH PROG BIO, V108, P186, DOI 10.1016/j.cmpb.2012.03.00; Santhi D, 2016, BIOMED ENG-BIOMED TE, V61, P443, DOI 10.1515/bmt-2015-018; Staal J, 2004, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V23, P501, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2004.82562; Yun WL, 2008, INFORM SCIENCES, V178, P106, DOI 10.1016/j.ins.2007.07.02; Zaki WMDW, 2016, BIOMED SIGNAL PROCES, V24, P72, DOI 10.1016/j.bspc.2015.09.01",21,4,4,1,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The predominant anomaly due to the blood flow dynamics leads to the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias in the cardiac system. In this work, estimation of cardiac output (CO) parameter using blood flow rate analysis is carried out, which is a vital parameter to identify the subjects with left- ventricular arrhythmias (LVA). In particular, LVA is a resultant component of characteristic changes in blood rheology (blood flow rate). The CO is an intrinsic parameter derived from the stroke volume (SV) characterized by end-diastolic/systolic volumes (EDV/ESV) and heart rate. The pumping of blood from left ventricle (LV) reconciles in to R-R intervals depicted on ECG, which are used for heart rate estimation. The deviation from the nominal values of CO implies that, the subject is more prone to LVA. Further, the identification of subjects with LVA is accomplished by computing the features from the ECG signals. The proposed Feature Ranking Score (FRS) algorithm employs different statistical parameters to label the score of the extracted features. The feature score enables the selection optimal features for classification. The optimal features are further given to the Least Square- Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier for training and testing phases. The signals are acquired from public domain MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, used for validating the proposed technique for identifying the LVA using blood flow.","[Karnan, Hemalatha; Sivakumaran, N.] Natl Inst Technol, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India; [Manivel, Rajajeyakumar] SRM Med Coll Hosp & Res Ctr, Dept Physiol Trichy, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India","Karnan, H (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India.",hema.ae2012@gmail.com; nsk@nitt.edu; rajakumar60@gmail.com,"Manivel, Dr. Rajajeyakumar/J-4217-2016","Manivel, Dr. Rajajeyakumar/0000-0002-0772-7259",,,"Abu Anas EM, 2010, BIOMED ENG ONLINE, V9, DOI 10.1186/1475-925X-9-4; Alonso-Atienza F, 2014, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V61, P832, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2013.229080; Alonso-Atienza F, 2012, EXPERT SYST APPL, V39, P1956, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2011.08.05; Amann A, 2005, BIOMED ENG ONLINE, V4, DOI 10.1186/1475-925X-4-6; [Anonymous], 2017, Circulation, V136, pe196, DOI 10.1161/CIR.000000000000053; Arafat MA, 2011, SIGNAL IMAGE VIDEO P, V5, P1, DOI 10.1007/s11760-009-0136-; Arunasakthi K., INT J INNOVATIVE RES, P190; Aslantas G, 2014, NEURAL NETW WORLD, V24, P267, DOI 10.14311/NNW.2014.24.01; Dandona L, 2017, LANCET, V390, P2437, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32804-; Fukuta Hidekatsu, 2008, Heart Fail Clin, V4, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.hfc.2007.10.00; Ghaffarl A, 2008, COMPUT ELECTR ENG, V34, P81, DOI 10.1016/j.compeleceng.2007.10.00; JIANG H, 2012, ARTICLE, V201; Koplan BA, 2009, MAYO CLIN PROC, V84, P289, DOI 10.1016/S0025-6196(11)61149-; LANCE GN, 1966, COMPUT J, V9, P60, DOI 10.1093/comjnl/9.1.6; Le TQ, 2013, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V60, P2350, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2013.225642; Moody GA, 2001, IEEE ENG MED BIOL, V20, P45, DOI 10.1109/51.93272; PAN J, 1985, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V32, P230, DOI 10.1109/TBME.1985.32553; Rawther NN, 2015, INT J ADV RES COMPUT, V4, P474, DOI [10.17148/IJARCCE.2015.44108, DOI 10.17148/IJARCCE.2015.44108; Razavipour F, 2015, J BIOENGINEERING BIO, V6, P1, DOI [10.4172/2155-9538.1000172, DOI 10.4172/2155-9538.1000172; Roonizi EK, 2016, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V64, P665, DOI 10.1109/TSP.2015.248959; Saxena SC, 2002, INT J SYST SCI, V33, P1073, DOI 10.1080/0020772021016715; SCHER AM, 1957, ANN NY ACAD SCI, V65, P768, DOI 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1957.tb36682.; Sedghamiz h, 2014, MATLAB IMPLEMENTATIO, DOI [10.13140/RG.2.2.14202.59841, DOI 10.13140/RG.2.2.14202.59841; Sheldon S.

This paper proposes a lightweight Intruder Node Detection and Isolation Action mechanism (INDIA) using feature extraction, feature optimization and classification techniques. The indirect and direct trust features are extracted from each node and the total trust feature is computed by combining them. The trust features are extracted from each node of MANET and these features are optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm as feature optimization technique. These optimized feature sets are then classified using Neural Networks (NN) classifier which identifies the intruder node. The performance of the proposed methodology is studied in terms of various parameters such as success rate in packet delivery, delay in communication and the amount of energy consumption for identifying and isolating the intruder.","[Kavitha, T.; Geetha, K.; Muthaiah, R.] SASTRA Deemed Univ, Sch Comp, Thanjavur, India","Kavitha, T (corresponding author), SASTRA Deemed Univ, Sch Comp, Thanjavur, India.",kavitha.t@it.sastra.edu,,"Thiyagarajan, Kavitha/0000-0002-0255-044X; Rajappa, Muthaiah/0000-0002-6659-1961",,,"Baadache A., 2010, INT J COMPUTER SCI I, V7, P1; Balan EV, 2015, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V50, P109, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2015.04.07; Blazevic L, 2001, IEEE COMMUN MAG, V39, P166, DOI 10.1109/35.92568; Chang JM, 2015, IEEE SYST J, V9, P65, DOI 10.1109/JSYST.2013.229619; Deng HM, 2002, IEEE COMMUN MAG, V40, P70, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2002.103985; Gopalakrishnan S., 2016, CIRCUITS SYST, V7, P748, DOI [10.4236/cs.2016.76064, DOI 10.4236/CS.2016.76064; Kavitha T, 2017, RES J PHARM BIOL CHE, V8, P143; Lal N, 2015, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V49, P264, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2015.04.25; Liu KJ, 2007, IEEE T MOBILE COMPUT, V6, P488, DOI 10.1109/TMC.2007.103; LU S, INTERNATIONAL CONFER, P42; Moudni H., 2016, P 2016 INT C EL IN; Patel K.S., 2015, 2015 INT C COMPUTER, P1, DOI [10.1109/IC4.2015.7375729, DOI 10.1109/IC4.2015.7375729; Petersen E, 2017, IEEE LATAMER CON; Singh Y, 2011, COMM COM INF SC, V203, P41; Tsou P.-C., 2011, P 2 INT C WIR COMM V, P; Vishnu KA, 2010, INT J COMPUTER APPL, V1, P38, DOI [10.5120/445-679, DOI 10.5120/445-679",16,6,6,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

If not treated, it can turn into a serious public health problem. The best method to treat asthma is to control it. Physicians recommend continuous monitoring on asthma symptoms and offering treatment preventive plans based on the patient's control level. Therefore, successful detection of the disease control level plays a critical role in presenting treatment plans. In view of this objective, we collected the data of 96 asthma patients within a 9-month period from a specialized hospital for pulmonary diseases in Tehran. A new ensemble learning algorithm with combining physicians' knowledge in the form of a rule-based classifier and supervised learning algorithms is proposed to detect asthma control level in a multivariate dataset with multiclass response variable. The model outcome resulting from the balancing operations and feature selection on data yielded the accuracy of 91.66%. Our proposed model combines medical knowledge with machine learning algorithms to classify asthma control level more accurately. This model can be applied in electronic self-care systems to support the real-time decision and personalized warnings on possible deterioration of asthma control level. Such tools can centralize asthma treatment from the current reactive care models into a preventive approach in which the physician's therapeutic actions would be based on control level.","[Khasha, Roghaye] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Ind & Syst Engn, Grp Informat Technol, Tehran 1411713116, Iran; [Sepehri, Mohammad Mehdi] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Ind & Syst Engn, Tehran 1411713116, Iran; [Mahdaviani, Seyed Alireza] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, NRITLD, Pediat Resp Dis Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran","Sepehri, MM (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Ind & Syst Engn, Tehran 1411713116, Iran.",r.khasha@modares.ac.ir; mehdi.sepehri@modares.ac.ir; mahdaviani@sbmu.ac.ir,,,,,"Aguinis H, 2013, ORGAN RES METHODS, V16, P270, DOI 10.1177/109442811247084; [Anonymous], 2018, GLOB STRAT ASTHM MA; Arvanitis G, 2018, P 10 HELL C ART IN; Bateman ED, 2015, J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUN, V135, P1457, DOI 10.1016/j.jaci.2014.08.01; Bethesda, 2007, 3 NAT HEART LUNG BL; Bousquet J, 2010, J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUN, V126, P926, DOI 10.1016/j.jaci.2010.07.01; Chawla NV, 2002, J ARTIF INTELL RES, V16, P321, DOI 10.1613/jair.95; Chen XW, 2007, ICMLA 2007: SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS, P429, DOI 10.1109/ICMLA.2007.3; Dhir CS, 2007, 2007 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION ACQUISITION, VOLS 1 AND 2, P52; Dubey R, 2014, NEUROIMAGE, V87, P220, DOI 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.10.00; Farion KJ, 2013, APPL CLIN INFORM, V4, P376, DOI 10.4338/ACI-2013-04-RA-002; Farion K, 2010, J MED SYST, V34, P551, DOI 10.1007/s10916-009-9268-; Finkelstein J, 2013, STUD HEALTH TECHNOL, V190, P56, DOI 10.3233/978-1-61499-276-9-5; FRIEDMAN JH, 1991, ANN STAT, V19, P1, DOI 10.1214/aos/117634796; Greenberg S, 2012, J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUN, V130, P1071, DOI 10.1016/j.jaci.2012.07.05; HONG H, 2016, 2016 7TH IEEE INTERN, V2016, P219, DOI DOI 10.1109/ICSESS.2016.788305; Honkoop PJ, 2017, BMJ OPEN, V7, DOI 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-01393; Ko FWS, 2012, RESPIROLOGY, V17, P370, DOI 10.1111/j.1440-1843.2011.02105.; Kocsis O, 2017, E-HEALTH BIOENG CONF, P571, DOI 10.1109/EHB.2017.799548; Kupczyk M, 2013, THORAX, V68, P611, DOI 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2012-20181; Lee CH, 2011, COMPUT METH PROG BIO, V101, P44, DOI 10.1016/j.cmpb.2010.04.01; Liu XY, 2009, IEEE T SYST MAN CY B, V39, P539, DOI 10.1109/TSMCB.2008.200785; Liu Yang, 2015, Int J Stat Med Res, V4, P28; Luo G, 2015, BMC MED INFORM DECIS, V15, DOI 10.1186/s12911-015-0208-; McHugh ML, 2013, BIOCHEM MEDICA, V23, P143, DOI 10.11613/BM.2013.01; Rokach L, 2010, ARTIF INTELL REV, V33, P1, DOI 10.1007/s10462-009-9124-; Seiffert C, 2008, PROC INT C TOOLS ART, P445, DOI 10.1109/ICTAI.2008.5; Serpen G, 2008, COMPUT BIOL MED, V38, P204, DOI 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2007.10.00; Shearer Colin, 2000, CRISP DM MODEL NEW B, V5, P1; Shrestha G.

This problem can be solved by employing image processing algorithms which enhances the accuracy of the diagnostic through image segmentation which reduces the misclassified malignant cancers. By employing segmentation, the unnecessary regions in the breast close to the boundary between the breast tissue and segmented pectoral muscle can be removed, therefore enhancing the accuracy the calculation as well as feature estimation. In-order to enhance the accuracy of classification, the proposed classifier integrates the decision trees and neural network into a system to report the progress of the breast cancer patients in an appropriate manner with the help of technology used in healthcare system.

Data owner prefers to outsource their confidential electronic data to the cloud for effective retrieval and storage without provoking the depletion or losses due to data management and maintenance. Secure data sharing and searching are vital. Be that as it may, secure search for the outsourced data is a formidable errand, which may easily incur the leakage of sensitive personal information. In this research, we propose a novel diversified access control framework composed of User Usage Based Encryption (UUBE) which is normally based on the searchable encryption scheme. In the UUBE demonstrate, Usage is mapped as credential/accreditation with time allotment to each event, where the event is considered as security trait or a privacy attribute. Data user/client can decipher an event if and only if there is a match between the accreditation and credential related to the event. A searchable encryption enables efficient routing of encrypted events using data or feature extraction algorithm as an important technique. Multicredential routing is modelled as an event dissemination strategy to strengthen weak data user confidentiality. The data user is permitted to maintain the accreditations/credentials as per their usage category. Private keys are assigned to the user/client as labels with the accreditations or credentials. A data owner/proprietor associates and relates each enciphered event with a set of credentials.","[Suresh, Dhina] St Josephs Coll Arts & Sci Women, Dept Comp Sci, Hosur, Tamil Nadu, India; [Florence, M.

The resulting damage to the small intestinal mucosa hampers nutrient absorption, and is characterized by diarrhea, abdominal pain, and a variety of extra-intestinal manifestations. Invasive and costly methods such as endoscopic biopsy are currently used to diagnose celiac disease. Detection of the disease by histopathologic analysis of biopsies can be challenging due to suboptimal sampling. Video capsule images were obtained from celiac patients and controls for comparison and classification. This study exploits the use of DAISY descriptors to project two-dimensional images onto one-dimensional vectors. Shannon entropy is then used to extract features, after which a particle swarm optimization algorithm coupled with normalization is employed to select the 30 best features for classification. Statistical measures of this paradigm were tabulated. The accuracy, positive predictive value, sensitivity and specificity obtained in distinguishing celiac versus control video capsule images were 89.82%, 89.17%, 94.35% and 83.20% respectively, using the 10-fold cross-validation technique. When employing manual methods rather than the automated means described in this study, technical limitations and inconclusive results may hamper diagnosis. Our findings suggest that the computer-aided detection system presented herein can render diagnostic information, and thus may provide clinicians with an important tool to validate a diagnosis of celiac disease.","[Vicnesh, Jahmunah; Wei, Joel Koh En; Oh, Shu Lih; Acharya, U.

The database of biomedical is huge and enhancing nature retrieving of specific content will be a critical task. Suggesting prescription with respect to identified disease based on profile analysis of specific patient is not available in current system. This paper proposes a recommendation system of prescription based on disease identification is done by combining user and professional suggestion with profile based analysis. Hence this focuses on profile based suggestions and report will be generated. The retrieving of specific suggestion from a huge database is done by hybrid feature selection algorithm. This approach focuses on enabling recommendation based on user profile and implementing Hybrid feature selection algorithm to retrieve specific content from a huge database. Hence it attains better retrieval of required content from a huge database compared to other existing approaches and suggests better recommendation with respect to user profile.","[Vijayarajeswari, R.] Mahendra Engn Coll Autonomous, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Namakkal, India; [Nagabhushan, M.] MS Ramaiah Inst Technol, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Parthasarathy, P.] VIT Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India","Vijayarajeswari, R (corresponding author), Mahendra Engn Coll Autonomous, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Namakkal, India.",vijayarajeswarir@mahendra.info,"Panchatcharam, Parthasarthy`/AAR-2127-2021","Panchatcharam, Parthasarthy`/0000-0003-3771-8350",,,"Ali H., 2012, 45 HAW INT C SYST SC, DOI [10.1109/HICSS.2012.363, DOI 10.1109/HICSS.2012.363; Basha AA, 2019, J MED SYST, V43, DOI 10.1007/s10916-019-1224-; Basheer S, 2019, INT J SOFTW INNOV, V7, P41, DOI 10.4018/IJSI.201904010; Bellazzi R, 2011, METHOD INFORM MED, V50, P536, DOI 10.3414/ME11-06-000; Bhatt B., 2014, INT J ENG DEV RES, V; Doukas C., 2009, P 9 INT C INF TECH; Fatima M, 2014, 2014 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE IN BIOINFORMATICS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOG; Guy I., SIGIR 10 P 33 INT AC, P19; Hovale SV, 2016, INT J ENG COMPUTER S, V5, P1669; Hsu C-H, 2018, J AMB INTEL HUM COMP, P1, DOI 10.1109/SC2.2018.0002; Kanisha B, 2018, PERSONAL UBIQ COMPUT, P; Kumar PM, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V86, P527, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.04.03; Lokesh S., 2018, NEURAL COMPUT APPL, V2018, P; Mathan K, 2018, DES AUTOM EMBED SYST, P; Panchatcharam P, 2019, INT J SOFTW INNOV, V7, P21, DOI 10.4018/IJSI.201904010; Parthasarathy P., 2018, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, V360, DOI 10.1088/1757-899X/360/1/01205; Parthasarathy Panchatchram, 2018, World Review of Science, Technology and Sustainable Development, V14, P5; Parthasarathy P, 2018, HEALTH INF SCI SYST, V6, DOI 10.1007/s13755-018-0043-; Parthasarathy P., 2018, INFORM MED UNLOCKE; Parthasarathy P., 2018, INT J COMPUT APPL, V42, P; Priya S, 2018, PERS UBIQUIT COMPUT, P; Suresh A., 2019, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, P; Varatharajan R, 2018, MOBILE NETW APPL, P; Varatharajan R, 2018, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, P",24,2,2,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

However, the emergence of ghost markers, which is caused by the mistaken recognition of markers and the incorrect correspondences between marker projections, may lead to tracking failures for these systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a strategy to prevent the emergence of ghost markers by identifying markers based on the features of their projections, finding the correspondences between marker projections based on the geometric information provided by markers, and fast-tracking markers in a 2D image between frames based on the sizes of their projections. Apart from validating its high robustness, the experimental results show that the proposed strategy can accurately recognize markers, correctly identify their correspondences, and meet the requirements of real-time tracking.","[Wu, Han; Lin, Qinyong; Yang, Rongqian; Zhou, Yuan; Zheng, Lingxiang; Huang, Yueshan; Lao, Yonghua] South China Univ Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Rongqian] Yale Univ, Sch Med, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Yang, Rongqian] Guangdong Engn Technol Res Ctr Translat Med Menta, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhigang] Guangzhou Aimooe Technol Co Ltd, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jinhua] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Canc, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Yang, RQ (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Yang, RQ (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Med, 333 Cedar St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.;Yang, RQ (corresponding author), Guangdong Engn Technol Res Ctr Translat Med Menta, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",bmeyrq@gmail.com,,,"National Natural Scientific Foundation of China [81671788]; Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Program [2016A020220006, 2017B020210008, 2017B010110015]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017 M612671]; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities [2017ZD082, x2yxD2182720]; Guangzhou Science and Technology Program [201704020228]; Chinese Scholarship Fund [201806155010]","This study was supported by the National Natural Scientific Foundation of China (81671788), the Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Program (2016A020220006, 2017B020210008, and 2017B010110015), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2017 M612671), the Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities (2017ZD082, x2yxD2182720), the Guangzhou Science and Technology Program (201704020228), and the Chinese Scholarship Fund (201806155010).","Cai K, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-015-0368-; CANNY J, 1986, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V8, P679, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.1986.476785; Chen XJ, 2015, J BIOMED INFORM, V55, P124, DOI 10.1016/j.jbi.2015.04.00; DIETERICH S, 2003, MED PHYS, V1256, P130, DOI DOI 10.1016/S0531-5131(03)00477-; Fitzgibbon A.

We used 262, 771 records from the electronic medical records and outpatient appointment systems of three clinics for logistic regression to analyze the impact of information technology on patients' access to medical care. We interviewed a few health professionals to gauge their reactions and to validate and understand our quantitative results. The proportion of inpatients affected by information technology is low, accounting for only 16.7% (N=43, 870). The difference between rural and urban groups is statistically significant, and rural households are more susceptible to information technology. In addition, distance has a significant positive effect. We demonstrate an inverted U-shaped relationship between severity of disease and the impact of information technology. Moreover, our interview results are consistent with our quantitative results. Quantitative and interview results suggest that health information technology plays a positive role in accessing medical care for patients with rural household and those in remote areas. Meanwhile, this effect is complex for patients with different severities of illnesses. Governments and managers should vigorously promote health information technology for healthcare delivery in the future and focus their attention on patients with serious diseases.","[Ye, Qing; Deng, Zhaohua] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Sch Med & Hlth Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Ye, Qing; Chen, Yanyan; Liao, Jiazhi; Li, Gang] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Tongji Hosp, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China","Deng, ZH (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Sch Med & Hlth Management, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",zh-deng@hust.edu.cn,,"Deng, Zhaohua/0000-0002-7744-7818; Ye, Qing/0000-0002-5432-7741",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71671073]; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province [2018CFB739],This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (award no. 71671073) and Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (award no. 2018CFB739).,"Asner SA, 2014, PLOS ONE, V9, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.009939; Bardhan IR, 2013, DECIS SUPPORT SYST, V55, P438, DOI 10.1016/j.dss.2012.10.00; Braveman P, 2006, ANNU REV PUBL HEALTH, V27, P167, DOI 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.10210; Braveman P, 2014, PUBLIC HEALTH REP, V129, P5, DOI 10.1177/00333549141291S20; Buntin MB, 2011, HEALTH AFFAIR, V30, P464, DOI 10.1377/hlthaff.2011.017; Carney TJ, 2017, J BIOMED INFORM, V68, P184, DOI 10.1016/j.jbi.2017.02.01; Chib A, 2015, J HEALTH COMMUN, V20, P4, DOI 10.1080/10810730.2013.86473; Cooper CP, 2012, J AM MED INFORM ASSN, V19, P960, DOI 10.1136/amiajnl-2011-00062; Cronin RM, 2018, J AM MED INFORM ASSN, V25, P1470, DOI 10.1093/jamia/ocy11; Fareed N, 2019, J AM MED INFORM ASSN, V26, P28, DOI 10.1093/jamia/ocy14; Fischer SH, 2014, INT J MED INFORM, V83, P624, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2014.06.00; Friedman J, 2010, J STAT SOFTW, V33, P1, DOI 10.18637/jss.v033.i0; Friel S, 2008, LANCET, V372, P1677, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61692-; Greysen SR, 2018, J AM MED INFORM ASSN, V25, P1626, DOI 10.1093/jamia/ocy12; Hall AK, 2015, HEALTH EDUC BEHAV, V42, P202, DOI 10.1177/109019811454781; Hao HJ, 2018, INFORM SYST RES, V29, P25, DOI 10.1287/isre.2017.074; Harrell FE, 2015, SPRINGER SER STAT, P219, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-19425-7_1; Hecht C, 2015, CLIN NUTR, V34, P53, DOI 10.1016/j.clnu.2014.01.00; Hong W, 2018, INT J MED INFORM, V110, P77, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.11.00; Hoque MR, 2016, BMC MED INFORM DECIS, V16, DOI 10.1186/s12911-016-0289-; Hosseinpoor AR, 2014, PLOS MED, V11, DOI 10.1371/journal.pmed.100172; Hu FB, 2011, OBES REV, V12, P552, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00863.; Humphries KH, 2000, SOC SCI MED, V50, P663, DOI 10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00319-; Khatun F, 2017, BMC HEALTH SERV RES, V17, DOI 10.1186/s12913-017-2523-; Mackert M, 2016, J MED INTERNET RES, V18, DOI 10.2196/jmir.634; Nguyen A, 2017, INT J MED INFORM, V103, P49, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.04.00; O'Neill J, 2014, J CLIN EPIDEMIOL, V67, P56, DOI 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2013.08.00; Sun J, 2016, AGING DIS, V7, DOI 10.14336/AD.2015.101; Tan Xiaodong, 2017, Value Health Reg Issues, V12, P112, DOI 10.1016/j.vhri.2017.04.00; van Deursen AJAM, 2014, NEW MEDIA SOC, V16, P507, DOI 10.1177/146144481348795; Welch VA, 2017, BMJ-BRIT MED J, V359, DOI 10.1136/bmj.j508; Wu H, 2019, INT J INFORM MANAGE, V49, P13, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.01.00; Zhang XF, 2017, HEALTH POLICY TECHN, V6, P383, DOI 10.1016/j.hlpt.2017.11.00",33,4,4,2,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In addition, it is common the generation of muscle, joint and vascular complications arising from the application of classic restraint devices in this phase of treatment. Currently, it is being observed that these problems could be solved with the use of Advanced Manufacturing techniques based on Additive Manufacturing (AM), industrial digitalization and reverse engineering for the realization of individualized immobilization splints. The present study proposes to give these splints a functional character in their design adapting them to a specific pathology, in this case to the partial rupture of Achilles tendon. It also provides a comparison against the use of conventional plaster splints as an improvement factor for their definitive implementation considering the initial sanitary use for which they were designed. In this way, there have been created therapeutic windows that allow the application of rehabilitation techniques, being the treatment that would be carried out developed in parallel. The designed splint has been made in FilaFlex and Polycarbonate, materials that guarantee comfort and resistance at the same time. In addition, an optimization in terms of material has been executed, lightening the splint and reducing environmental impact and manufacturing costs.

However, the radiation problems of wireless devices, the power supply problems of wearable devices and the deployment of body area networks have become obstacles to their wide application in the field of health care. In order to solve the above problems, this paper studies and designs a wearable health medical body area network which is convenient for human health monitoring and medical care, starting from low-cost deployment of wireless wearable devices and active control of wireless radiation. Firstly, in order to avoid replacing equipment batteries, improve the relay and data aggregation capabilities of wireless body area network, and reduce the communication and computing load of edge devices, a deployment scheme of wireless medical health wearable devices is designed based on the optimal segmentation algorithm of Steiner spanning tree. Then, in order to minimize the charging cost and maximize the global charging utility of single source and multiple points in a finite time slot, an approximate algorithm for the optimal charging sequence based on 01 knapsack problem, i.e., the access path of wireless wearable devices, is designed. Then, an active radiation control algorithm for wearable medical health body area network is proposed, which can actively control the transmission power and radiation status of these wireless devices. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is better than battery-powered wireless body area network and wireless rechargeable body area network, 16% and 44% reduction of devices, 25%(sic)13% reduction of energy consumption, 26% reduction of radiation, and 5.18 and 1.13 times improvement of signal quality.","[Jin, Yong] Changshu Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Changshu 215500, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Jin, Y (corresponding author), Changshu Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Changshu 215500, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jinyong@cslg.cn,,,Jiangsu Students' innovation and entrepreneurship training program [201810333029Y],The authors would like to thank the support from the Jiangsu Students' innovation and entrepreneurship training program (NO. 201810333029Y).,"Arakawa T, 2018, BIOSENS BIOELECTRON, V103, P171, DOI 10.1016/j.bios.2017.12.01; Ben Elhadj H, 2012, INT J E-HEALTH MED C, V3, P1, DOI 10.4018/jehmc.201204010; Chaudhari K, 2018, IEEE T IND INFORM, V14, P106, DOI 10.1109/TII.2017.271348; Gao GP, 2018, IEEE ANTENN WIREL PR, V17, P434, DOI 10.1109/LAWP.2018.279406; Gao GP, 2017, MICROW OPT TECHN LET, V59, P761, DOI 10.1002/mop.3040; GIL I, APPLICATIONS, V31, P1, DOI DOI 10.1080/09205071.2017.134185; Jain PC, 2011, IETE TECH REV, V28, P362, DOI 10.4103/0256-4602.8355; Jandak V, 2017, MECH SYST SIGNAL PR, V96, P260, DOI 10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.04.00; Latre B, 2011, WIREL NETW, V17, P1, DOI 10.1007/s11276-010-0252-; Malyshevsky VS, 2017, RUSS PHYS J+, V59, P1367, DOI 10.1007/s11182-017-0918-; Marassi V, 2018, ROY SOC OPEN SCI, V5, DOI 10.1098/rsos.17111; Pevec D, 2018, INT J ENERG RES, V42, P3102, DOI 10.1002/er.397; Rathee D, 2014, HEALTH TECHNOL-GER, V4, P239, DOI 10.1007/s12553-014-0083-; Sambo YA, 2015, IEEE COMMUN SURV TUT, V17, P790, DOI 10.1109/COMST.2014.236413; Sharma Jitendra, 2012, Int J Electron Healthc, V7, P68, DOI 10.1504/IJEH.2012.04867; Tahir S, 2017, J MED IMAG HEALTH IN, V7, P1409, DOI 10.1166/jmihi.2017.215; Varga N, 2015, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V63, P317, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.34; Yu S., 2015, CASE ANAL APPL MATL",18,7,7,3,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

With the availability of large volume of health care datasets and progressions in deep learning techniques, systems are now well equipped in diagnosing many health problems. Utilizing the intensity of substantial historical information in electronic health record (EHR), we built up, a conventional predictive temporal model utilizing recurrent neural systems (RNN) like LSTM and connected to longitudinal time stepped EHR. Experience records were contribution to RNN to anticipate the analysis and prescription classes for a resulting visit during heart disappointment (e.g. diagnosis codes, drug codes or method codes). In this paper, we also investigated whether use of deep learning to model temporal relations among events in electronic health records (EHRs) would enhance the model performance in predicting initial diagnosis of heart failure (HF) compared to some of the traditional methods that disregard temporality. By examining these time stamped EHRs, we could recognize the associations between various diagnosis occasions and finally predicate when a patient is being analyzed for a disease. In any case, it is hard to access the current EHR data straightforwardly, since almost all data are sparse and not standardized. Along these lines, we proposed a robust model for prediction of heart failure. The fundamental commitment of this paper is to predict the failure of heart by means of a neural network model based on patient's electronic medicinal information. In order to, demonstrate the diagnosis events and prediction of heart failure, we used the medical concept vectors and the essential standards of a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep network model. The proposed LSTM model uses SiLU and tanh as activation function in the hidden layers and Softmax in output layer in the network. Bridgeout is used as a regularization technique for weight optimization throughout the network. Assessments subject to the real-time data exhibit the favorable effectiveness and feasibility of recommended model in the risk of heart failure prediction. The results showed improved accuracy in heart failure detection and the model performance is compared using the existing deep learning models. Enhanced prior detection could expose novel chances for deferring or anticipating movement to analysis of heart failure and diminish cost.","[Maragatham, G.; Devi, Shobana] SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Informat & Technol, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","Maragatham, G (corresponding author), SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Informat & Technol, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.",maragathamhaarish@gmail.com; shobanak07@gmail.com,"Maragatham, G./ABC-6758-2021; Ayyavu, Shobanadevi/ABB-2623-2021",,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, CLIN CLASS SOFTW SE; [Anonymous], 2014, P 20 ACM SIGKDD INT, DOI DOI 10.1145/2623330.262375; [Anonymous], CLIN CLASS SOFTW CC; Arnold JMO, 2003, CIRCULATION, V107, P1284, DOI 10.1161/01.CIR.0000054165.93055.4; Bengio Y, 2009, FOUND TRENDS MACH LE, V2, P1, DOI 10.1561/220000000; Bianchi FM, 2015, IEEE ACCESS, V3, P1931, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2015.248594; Box G.

What patient competences are chatbots aimed at? Which chatbot technical enablers are of most interest in the health domain? We identify 30 articles related to health chatbots from 2014 to 2018. We analyze the selected articles qualitatively and extract a triplet <technicalEnablers, competence, illness> for each of them. This data serves to provide a first overview of chatbot-mediated behavior change on the health domain. Main insights include: nutritional disorders and neurological disorders as the main illness areas being tackled; affect as the human competence most pursued by chatbots to attain change behavior; and personalization and consumability as the most appreciated technical enablers.

The main focus in transforming traditional healthcare to smart healthcare is on facilitating the patients as well as medical professionals. However, this changover is not easy due to various issues of security and integrity associated with it. Security of patients's personal health record and privacy can be handled well by permitting only authorized access to the confidential health-data via suitably designed authentication scheme. In pursuit to contribute in this direction, we came across the role of Universal Serial Bus (USB), the most widely accepted interface, in enabling communication between peripheral devices and a host controller like laptop, personal computer, smart phone, tablet etc. In the process, we analysed a recently proposed a three-factor authentication scheme for consumer USB Mass Storage Devices (MSD) by He et al. In this paper, we demonstrate that He et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to leakage of temporary but session specific information attacks, late detection of message replay, forward secrecy attacks, and backward secrecy attacks. Then motivated with the benefits of USB, we propose a secure three-factor authentication scheme for smart healthcare.","[Renuka, Km; Kumari, Saru] Chaudhary Charan Singh Univ, Dept Math, Meerut 250004, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Li, Xiong] Hunan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Xiangtan 411201, Peoples R China","Li, X (corresponding author), Hunan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Xiangtan 411201, Peoples R China.",baliyanrenuka@gmail.com; saryusiirohi@gmail.com; lixiongzhq@163.com,"Li, Xiong/K-7233-2012; Kumari, Saru/K-2038-2019","Li, Xiong/0000-0001-6619-554X; Kumari, Saru/0000-0003-4929-5383",Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (CN) [2018JJ3191] Funding Source: Medline,,"Aghili SF, 2019, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V96, P410, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2019.02.02; Alzarouni M., 2006, P 4 AUSTR INF SEC C, P31; Amin R, 2019, IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH, V23, P1749, DOI 10.1109/JBHI.2018.287031; Amin R, 2015, J MED SYST, V39, DOI 10.1007/s10916-015-0318-; Aslam MU, 2017, J MED SYST, V41, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0658-; Challa S, 2018, COMPUT ELECTR ENG, V69, P534, DOI 10.1016/j.compeleceng.2017.08.00; Chen B., 2012, J INFORM COMPUTATION, V9, P435; Chen LX, 2019, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V95, P420, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2019.01.01; Chen TL, 2012, J MED SYST, V36, P1345, DOI 10.1007/s10916-010-9595-; Dodis Y, 2004, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3027, P52; He DB, 2015, MULTIMEDIA SYST, V21, P49, DOI 10.1007/s00530-013-0346-; He DB, 2014, IEEE T CONSUM ELECTR, V60, P30, DOI 10.1109/TCE.2014.678092; Holdsworth Jay, 2019, Smart Health, V12, P82, DOI 10.1016/j.smhl.2017.12.00; Hou JL, 2015, INT J DISTRIB SENS N, DOI 10.1155/2015/18365; Irshad A, 2017, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V76, P16463, DOI 10.1007/s11042-016-3921-; Khan MK, 2014, SECUR COMMUN NETW, V7, P399, DOI 10.1002/sec.79; Lee CC, 2013, IET COMPUT DIGIT TEC, V7, P48, DOI 10.1049/iet-cdt.2012.007; Li CS, 2011, J STAT COMPUT SIM, V81, P1081, DOI 10.1080/0094965100367741; Li CT, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0474-; Li X, 2018, IEEE INTERNET THINGS, V5, P1606, DOI 10.1109/JIOT.2017.278780; Li X, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V84, P149, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2017.08.02; Li X, 2017, COMPUT NETW, V129, P429, DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2017.03.01; Li X, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0629-; Lu YR, 2015, J MED SYST, V39, DOI 10.1007/s10916-015-0221-; Masdari M, 2017, J NETW COMPUT APPL, V87, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.jnca.2017.03.00; Mishra D, 2014, J MED SYST, V38, DOI 10.1007/s10916-014-0041-; Moon J, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-015-0422-; Wu F, 2018, COMPUT ELECTR ENG, V68, P107, DOI 10.1016/j.compeleceng.2018.03.03; Wu F, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V82, P727, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2017.08.04; Wu F, 2017, MULTIMEDIA SYST, V23, P195, DOI 10.1007/s00530-015-0476-; Yang FY, 2010, IEEE T CONSUM ELECTR, V56, P2339, DOI 10.1109/TCE.2010.568110; Zhang SB, 2019, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V94, P40, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.10.05; Zhang SB, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V86, P881, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2017.06.02",33,24,24,1,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In the proposed work, a cloud based system is proposed for automatic and real-time screening of Glaucoma with the use of automatic image processing techniques. The proposed system offers scalability to the developers and easy accessibility to the consumers. The proposed system is device and location independent. The input digital image is analyzed and a comprehensive diagnostic report is generated consisting of detailed analysis of indicative medical parameters like optic-cup-to-disc ratio, optic neuro-retinal rim, ISNT rules making the report informative and clinically significant. With recent advances in the field of communication technologies, the internet facilities are available that make the proposed system an efficient and economical method for initial screening and offer preventive and diagnostic steps in early disease intervention and management. The proposed system can perform an initial screening test in an average time of 6 s on high resolution fundus images. The proposed system has been tested on a fundus database and an average sensitivity of 93.7% has been achieved for Glaucoma cases. In places where there is scarcity of trained ophthalmologists and lack of awareness of such diseases, the cloud based system can be used as an effective diagnostic assistive tool.","[Soorya, M.] Amity Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Noida, India; [Issac, Ashish] Amity Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Noida, India; [Dutta, Malay Kishore] Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Tech Univ, Ctr Adv Studies, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India","Soorya, M (corresponding author), Amity Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Noida, India.",alevoorsoorya01@gmail.com; issac017@gmail.com; malaykishoredutta@gmail.com,,"Dutta, Malay Kishore/0000-0003-2462-737X",Department of Science and Technology [DST/TSG/ICT/2013/37],"This work was supported in part by the Grants from Department of Science and Technology, No. DST/TSG/ICT/2013/37.

One of the most important issues faced by the biometric system developer is to protect the template obtained from the biometric of a person. Unimodal biometric system has some drawbacks such as noisy data, interclass variations and spoof attack. Multimodal biometric system has been developed to address the boundaries of unimodal biometric system and increase the security of template. In this paper, template security analysis of multimodal biometric system based of fingerprint and palmprint is proposed and implemented. Fuzzy vault scheme is employed to protect both the fingerprint and palmprint template. At enrollment, image processing techniques such as image enhancement, segmentation and bottom-hat filtering are applied on both the biometric to improve the quality and subsequently the most important features are extracted.

In actual usage, a PEKS scheme should be employed with a PKE scheme since PEKS itself does not support the decryption of data. Since a naive composition of a PEKS ciphertext and a PKE ciphertext does not provide CCA security, several attempts have been made to integrate PEKS and PKE in a joint CCA manner (PEKS/PKE for short). In this paper, we further extend these works by integrating secure-channel free PEKS (SCF-PEKS) and PKE, which we call SCF-PEKS/PKE, where no secure channel is required to send trapdoors. We give a formal security definition of SCF-PEKS/PKE in a joint CCA manner, and propose a generic construction of SCF-PEKS/PKE based on anonymous identity-based encryption, tag-based encryption, and one-time signature. We also strengthen the current consistency definition according to the secure-channel free property, and show that our construction is strongly consistent if the underlying IBE provides unrestricted strong collision-freeness which is defined in this paper. We also show that such an IBE scheme can be constructed by employing the Abdalla et al. transformations (TCC 2010/J. Cryptology 2018). Finally, as an application of SCF-PEKS/PKE, we strengthen the security of encrypted Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system proposed by Guo and Yau (J. Medical Sys. 2015).","[Suzuki, Tatsuya; Ohigashi, Toshihiro] Tokai Univ, Minato Ku, 2-3-23 Takanawa, Tokyo 1088619, Japan; [Suzuki, Tatsuya; Emura, Keita; Ohigashi, Toshihiro] Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol NICT, 4-2-1 Nukui Kitamachi, Tokyo 1848795, Japan","Suzuki, T (corresponding author), Tokai Univ, Minato Ku, 2-3-23 Takanawa, Tokyo 1088619, Japan.;Suzuki, T (corresponding author), Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol NICT, 4-2-1 Nukui Kitamachi, Tokyo 1848795, Japan.",t-suzuki@star.tokai-u.jp; k-emura@nict.go.jp; ohigashi@tsc.u-tokai.ac.jp,,"Ohigashi, Toshihiro/0000-0002-6628-8452; Emura, Keita/0000-0002-8969-3581",JSPS KAKENHI [JP16H02808]; MIC/SCOPE [162108102],This work was supported in part by the JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP16H02808 and the MIC/SCOPE #162108102.,"Abdalla M, 2008, J CRYPTOL, V21, P350, DOI 10.1007/s00145-007-9006-; Abdalla M, 2018, J CRYPTOL, V31, P307, DOI 10.1007/s00145-017-9258-; Abdalla M, 2010, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V5978, P48; Baek J, 2006, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V4176, P21; Bellare M., 1993, ACM C COMP COMM SEC, P6; Bellare M, 2007, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V4450, P20; Boneh D, 2004, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3027, P50; Boneh D, 2003, SIAM J COMPUT, V32, P586, DOI 10.1137/S009753970139852; Boyen X, 2006, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V4117, P29; Buccafurri Francesco, 2015, SECRYPT 2015 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Security and Cryptography, P44; Canetti R, 2004, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3027, P207, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-24676-3_1; Canetti R, 2004, J ACM, V51, P557, DOI 10.1145/1008731.100873; Chen Y, 2016, DESIGN CODE CRYPTOGR, V78, P493, DOI 10.1007/s10623-014-0014-; Emura K, 2017, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V10394, P3, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-64701-2_; Emura K, 2015, SECUR COMMUN NETW, V8, P1547, DOI 10.1002/sec.110; Fang LM, 2013, INFORM SCIENCES, V238, P221, DOI 10.1016/j.ins.2013.03.00; Fang LM, 2009, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V5888, P248, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-10433-6_1; Farshim P, 2013, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V7778, P352, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-36362-7_2; Fuhr T, 2007, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V4784, P22; Gentry C, 2006, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V4004, P44; Guo LF, 2015, J MED SYST, V39, DOI 10.1007/s10916-014-0178-; Hofheinz D., 2008, IACR CRYPTOL EPRINT, V2008, P42; Jie Chen, 2012, Pairing-Based Cryptography - Pairing 2012. 5th International Conference.

In this context, health research initiatives have evolved from user-centred monolithic solutions into collaborative partnerships of different stakeholders that gather around different technological platforms. In order to identify the lacks and opportunities in this area, a systematic mapping study was conducted with the aim of identifying and analysing the recent research projects developed in Europe related to technological ecosystems in the health sector. The study covered closed European research projects from 2003 to 2018. This paper aims to extend that systematic mapping study through ongoing research projects. The analysis of these research projects provides an overview of the current trends and identify the lacks and opportunities to define new advances in this research area. Moreover, the comparison between the first mapping study focused on closed projects, and the current study, allows getting an overview of the evolution of technological ecosystems in the health sector.","[Garcia-Holgado, Alicia; Marcos-Pablos, Samuel; Theron-Sanchez, Roberto; Garcia-Penalvo, Francisco J.] Univ Salamanca, GRIAL Res Grp, Res Inst Educ Sci, Comp Sci Dept, Salamanca, Spain","Garcia-Holgado, A (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, GRIAL Res Grp, Res Inst Educ Sci, Comp Sci Dept, Salamanca, Spain.",aliciagh@usal.es,"GARCÍA-PEÑALVO, Francisco José/D-5445-2013; García-Holgado, Alicia/I-1713-2014; Theron, Roberto/B-5315-2008; Pablos, Samuel Marcos -/AAB-4601-2019","GARCÍA-PEÑALVO, Francisco José/0000-0001-9987-5584; García-Holgado, Alicia/0000-0001-9663-1103; Theron, Roberto/0000-0001-6739-8875; Pablos, Samuel Marcos -/0000-0003-3546-2822",Spanish Government Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [TIN2016-80172-R]; Ministry of Education of the Junta de Castilla y Leon (Spain) [SA061P17],This study was funded by the Spanish Government Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness throughout the DEFINES project (Ref.

However, lack of radiological expertise in TB detection leads to indiscriminate chest radiograph (CXR) screening. A modest classification approach based on the local image description to detect subtle characteristics of TB using CXRs is highly recommended. In this work, an attempt has been made to classify normal and TB CXR images using Bag of Features (BoF) approach with Speeded-Up Robust Feature (SURF) descriptor. The images are obtained from a public database. Lung fields segmentation is performed using Distance Regularized Level Set (DRLS) formulation. The results of segmentation are validated against the ground truth images using similarity, overlap and area correlation measures. BoF approach with SURF keypoint descriptors is implemented to categorize the images using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier. The obtained results demonstrate that the DRLS method is able to delineate lung fields from CXR images. The BoF with SURF keypoint descriptor is able to characterize local attributes of normal and TB images. The segmentation results are found to be in high correlation with ground truth. MLP classifier is found to provide high Recall, Specificity (Spec), Accuracy, F-score and Area Under the Curve (AUC) values of 87.7%, 85.9%, 87.8%, 87.6% and 94% respectively between normal and abnormal images. The proposed computer aided diagnostic approach is found to perform better as compared to the existing methods. Thus, the study can be of significant assistance to physicians at the point of care in resource constrained regions.","[Govindarajan, Satyavratan; Swaminathan, Ramakrishnan] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Appl Mech, Biomed Engn Grp, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India","Govindarajan, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Appl Mech, Biomed Engn Grp, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.",s.vratan@gmail.com,"Swaminathan, Ramakrishnan/C-8054-2013","GOVINDARAJAN, SATYAVRATAN/0000-0002-2609-7213","Science and Engineering Research Board, Department of Science & Technology, Government of India [SERB-SB/S3/EECE/291/201]","This study is funded by Science and Engineering Research Board, Department of Science & Technology, Government of India (SERB-SB/S3/EECE/291/201).","Anandh KR, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-015-0396-; Anandh KR, 2014, IEEE ENG MED BIO, P1945, DOI 10.1109/EMBC.2014.694399; Avni U, 2009, I S BIOMED IMAGING, P350, DOI 10.1109/ISBI.2009.519305; Avni Uri., 2010, P INT C MULT INF RET P INT C MULT INF RET, P15; Bay H, 2008, COMPUT VIS IMAGE UND, V110, P346, DOI 10.1016/j.cviu.2007.09.01; Bishop C.M., 1995, NEURAL NETWORKS PAT; Candemir S., 2012, IEEE HEALTHC TECHN C, P3; Candemir S, 2014, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V33, P577, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2013.229049; Cruz-Roa A, 2011, ARTIF INTELL MED, V52, P91, DOI 10.1016/j.artmed.2011.04.01; Csurka G., 2004, WORKSH STAT LEARN CO, V1, P1, DOI DOI 10.1234/1234567; Dardas NH, 2011, IEEE T INSTRUM MEAS, V60, P3592, DOI 10.1109/TIM.2011.216114; Hasan F, 2017, INT C ROB AUT SCI, P; Hooda R., 2019, ADV INTELL SYST COMP, P273, DOI [10.1007/978-981-13-0589-4_25, DOI 10.1007/978-981-13-0589-4_25; Hooda R, 2019, BIOMED ENG LETT, V9, P109, DOI [10.1007/s13534-018-0086-z(0123456789().,-volV)(0123456789,-().volV), 10.1007/s13534-018-0086-z; Islam M., 2017, J BIOMED SCI ENG, V10, P86, DOI [10.4236/jbise.2017.105B010, DOI 10.4236/JBISE.2017.105B010, DOI 10.4236/jbise.2017.105B010; Jaeger S, 2014, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V33, P233, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2013.228409; Jaeger S, 2013, QUANT IMAG MED SURG, V3, P89, DOI 10.3978/j.issn.2223-4292.2013.04.0; Karargyris A, 2016, INT J COMPUT ASS RAD, V11, P99, DOI 10.1007/s11548-015-1242-; Kashif M, 2016, COMPUT BIOL MED, V68, P67, DOI 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2015.11.00; Kavitha JC, 2018, J MED SYST, V42, DOI 10.1007/s10916-018-1067-; Lee WL, 2016, MED BIOL ENG COMPUT, V54, P1409, DOI 10.1007/s11517-015-1412-; Li CM, 2010, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V19, P3243, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2010.206969; Lin CC, 2010, INJURY, V41, P869, DOI 10.1016/j.injury.2010.04.02; Lopes UK, 2017, COMPUT BIOL MED, V89, P135, DOI 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.08.00; Maintz J B, 1998, Med Image Anal, V2, P1, DOI 10.1016/S1361-8415(01)80026-; Melendez J, 2018, INT J TUBERC LUNG D, V22, P567, DOI 10.5588/ijtld.17.049; O'Hara S., 2011, ARXIV11013354201; Qin CL, 2018, BIOMED ENG ONLINE, V17, DOI 10.1186/s12938-018-0544-; Rueda Andrea, 2012, Progress in Pattern Recognition, Image Analysis, ComputerVision, and Applications.

In this study, we propose a new counting method, which consists of three modules including localization, segmentation and classification. The localization of BMC is achieved from a color transformation enhanced BMC sample image and stepwise averaging method. In the nucleus segmentation, both stepwise averaging method and Otsu's method are applied to obtain a weighted threshold for segmenting the patch into nucleus and non-nucleus. In the cytoplasm segmentation, a color weakening transformation, an improved region growing method and the K-Means algorithm are employed. The connected cells with BMC will be separated by the marker-controlled watershed algorithm. The features will be extracted for the classification after the segmentation. In this study, the BMC are classified using the support vector machine into five classes; namely, neutrophilic split granulocyte, neutrophilic stab granulocyte, metarubricyte, mature lymphocytes and the outlier (all other cells not listed). Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior segmentation and classification performance with an average segmentation accuracy of 91.76% and an average recall rate of 87.49%. The comparison shows that the proposed segmentation and classification methods outperform the existing methods.","[Liu, Hong; Cao, Haichao; Song, Enmin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Wuhan Shi, Peoples R China","Song, EM (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Wuhan Shi, Peoples R China.",enmin_song@126.com,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0112804],"The National Key R&D Program of China (Grant Nos. 2017YFC0112804) supported this work.

The short piece of review from the user can help a business determine or understand the attitude of the user thereby predict the customer's behaviour and itsubstantiallyimproves the quality of service parameters. The proposed Robust User Sentiment Biterm Topic Mixture (RUSBTM)model discovers the user preference and their sentiment orientation views for effective Topic Modelling using Biterms or word-pair from the short text of a particular venue. Since short review or text suffers from data sparse, the user aggregation strategy is adapted to form a pseudo document and the word pairset is created for the whole corpus. The RUSBTM learns topics by generating the word co-occurrence patterns thereby inferring topics with rich corpus-level information. By analysing the sentiments of the paired words and their corresponding topics in the review corpus of the particular venue, prediction can be done that exactly portrays the user interest, preference and expectation from a particular venue. The RUSBTM model proved to be more robust and also, the extracted topics are more coherent and informative. Also the method uses accurate sentiment polarity techniques to exactly capture the sentiment orientation and the model proves to be outperforming better when compared to other state of art methods.","[Nimala, K.; Jebakumar, R.] SRM Univ, Sch Comp, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","Nimala, K (corresponding author), SRM Univ, Sch Comp, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.",nimskt@gmail.com,"R, JEBAKUMAR/ABE-8759-2021","R, JEBAKUMAR/0000-0002-1570-2561",,,"[Anonymous], 2007, P 16 INT C WORLD WID, DOI DOI 10.1145/1242572.124259; Balan EV, 2014, IEEE I C COMP INT CO, P89; Bicalho P, 2017, INFORM SCIENCES, V393, P66, DOI 10.1016/j.ins.2017.02.00; Blei DM, 2003, J MACH LEARN RES, V3, P993, DOI 10.1162/jmlr.2003.3.4-5.99; Cheng XQ, 2014, IEEE T KNOWL DATA EN, V26, P2928, DOI 10.1109/TKDE.2014.231387; Devi G.

Dental biotribology, has been one of the most important branches in biotribology in recent years. The aim of this research is to investigate the tribological performances in the tooth-to-tooth contact and material-to-natural tooth contact (zirconia vs. zirconia and natural tooth vs. zirconia). The presented research was carried out by testing the above mentioned tribological pairs with the use of a reciprocating tribometer under lubricated conditions (artificial saliva). The normal force used in the tests was 20N the time for each test was of 60min. The stroke length was 2mm, according to the range of displacement used in scientific literature. The wear mass loss evaluation was evaluated by using a gravimetric method. In order to characterize the wear mechanisms, present in the worn surfaces after each of tribo-tests, a topographic analysis was carried with a 3D non-contact optical profiler. The results show that the minimum value of the COF is obtained in the case of Zirconia vs. Zirconia tribo-couple. The results on the wear mass loss show a very low wear rate when coupling in tribological condition natural tooth with a ceramic restoration (a mean value of 0.5mg was found). This rate is even lower when the contact is between two artificial zirconia teeth.","[Ruggiero, Alessandro] Univ Salerno, Dept Ind Engn, I-84084 Fisciano, Italy; [D'Amato, Roberto; Blaya Haro, Fernando] Tech Univ Madrid, Madrid 28012, Spain; [Sbordone, Ludovico; Lanza, Antonio] Univ Salerno, Dept Med Surg & Dent Schola Med Salernitana, Sch Dent, Via S Allende, I-84081 Salerno, Italy","D'Amato, R (corresponding author), Tech Univ Madrid, Madrid 28012, Spain.",ruggiero@unisa.it; r.damato@upm.es; lsbordone@unisa.it; fernando.blaya@upm.es; alanza@unisa.it,"D'Amato, Roberto/L-9153-2014; Ruggiero, Alessandro/I-7411-2015","D'Amato, Roberto/0000-0001-8090-922X; Ruggiero, Alessandro/0000-0002-5111-2331; Lanza, Antonio/0000-0002-2935-4668",,,"AENOR, 2015, 68722015 AENOR UNEE; Affatato S, 2017, COMPOS PART B-ENG, V113, P164, DOI 10.1016/j.compositesb.2017.01.02; Affatato S, 2016, COMPOS PART B-ENG, V92, P290, DOI 10.1016/j.compositesb.2016.02.02; Al-Hiyasat AS, 1999, J PROSTHET DENT, V82, P476, DOI 10.1016/S0022-3913(99)70037-; Ashcroft AT, 2010, P I MECH ENG J-J ENG, V224, P539, DOI 10.1243/13506501JET67; Buciumeanu M, 2017, TRIBOL INT, V116, P192, DOI 10.1016/j.triboint.2017.07.01; d'Incau E, 2012, ARCH ORAL BIOL, V57, P214, DOI 10.1016/j.archoralbio.2011.08.02; Eisenburger M, 2002, J DENT, V30, P349, DOI 10.1016/S0300-5712(02)00049-; Eisenburger M, 2002, J DENT, V30, P341, DOI 10.1016/S0300-5712(02)00048-; Imfeld T, 1996, EUR J ORAL SCI, V104, P151, DOI 10.1111/j.1600-0722.1996.tb00063.; Jung YS, 2010, J ADV PROSTHODONT, V2, P111, DOI 10.4047/jap.2010.2.3.11; Koczorowski R, 1999, J PROSTHET DENT, V81, P453, DOI 10.1016/S0022-3913(99)80013-; Krolczyk GM, 2016, MEASUREMENT, V88, P176, DOI 10.1016/j.measurement.2016.03.05; Krolczyk GM, 2014, METROL MEAS SYST, V21, P759, DOI 10.2478/mms-2014-006; Li H, 2001, WEAR, V249, P980, DOI 10.1016/S0043-1648(01)00835-; Liu YH, 2010, J EUR CERAM SOC, V30, P1297, DOI 10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2009.11.01; Mayworm CI, 2008, J DENT, V36, P703, DOI 10.1016/j.jdent.2008.05.00; Merola M, 2016, MEASUREMENT, V90, P365, DOI 10.1016/j.measurement.2016.05.00; Moszner N, 2001, PROG POLYM SCI, V26, P535, DOI 10.1016/S0079-6700(01)00005-; Nicholson JW, 2007, DENT MATER, V23, P615, DOI 10.1016/j.dental.2006.05.00; NORMAN RL, 1964, J PROSTHET DENT, V14, P45, DOI 10.1016/0022-3913(64)90116-; Preis V, 2011, DENT MATER, V27, P796, DOI 10.1016/j.dental.2011.04.00; Ruggiero A, 2018, SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TECHNOLOGICAL ECOSYSTEMS FOR ENHANCING MULTICULTURALITY (TEEM'18), P440, DOI 10.1145/3284179.328425; Ruggiero A, 2017, TRIBOL INT, V109, P529, DOI 10.1016/j.triboint.2017.01.03; Ruggiero A, 2016, TRIBOL INT, V96, P349, DOI 10.1016/j.triboint.2015.12.04; Ruggiero A, 2015, TRIBOL INT, V92, P154, DOI 10.1016/j.triboint.2015.06.00; Sarode Gargi S, 2013, J Oral Maxillofac Pathol, V17, P222, DOI 10.4103/0973-029X.11978; Schlueter N, 2012, Adv Dent Res, V24, P68, DOI 10.1177/002203451244983; Thompson JY, 2007, MAT SCI ENG C-BIO S, V27, P565, DOI 10.1016/j.msec.2006.05.03; Upadhyay D, 2006, MAT SCI ENG A-STRUCT, V432, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.msea.2006.05.00; Valasek P, 2018, COMPOS PART B-ENG, V146, P88, DOI 10.1016/j.compositesb.2018.04.00; van der Bilt A, 2011, J ORAL REHABIL, V38, P754, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2842.2010.02197.; Wang L, 2012, J EUR CERAM SOC, V32, P2599, DOI 10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.03.02; Wu YQ, 2015, J MECH BEHAV BIOMED, V44, P23, DOI 10.1016/j.jmbbm.2014.12.01; Yin L, 2003, WEAR, V255, P975, DOI 10.1016/S0043-1648(03)00195-; Zheng J, 2007, TRIBOL LETT, V26, P181, DOI 10.1007/s11249-006-9192-; Zhou D, 2007, LUBR ENG, V32, P5; Zhou ZR, 2008, J PHYS D APPL PHYS, V41, DOI 10.1088/0022-3727/41/11/11300",38,7,7,7,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The study of psychophysiological response of soldiers in these asymmetrical and non-controlled situations remains a challenge. The present research aimed to analyze the psychophysiological response and the variations in specific fine motor skill after a checkpoint simulation which included surveillance, unexpected attacks, and melee combat. Psychophysiological parameters -heart rate, blood glucose, pressure, oxygen saturation, and lactate, legs ' strength, skin temperature, cortical activation, anxiety-, as well as fine motor skills were analyzed in a sample of 24 professional Spanish Army soldiers (35.67 +/- 6.62years, 177.21 +/- 7.37cm, 82.29 +/- 11.02kg, 26.17 +/- 2.82 BMI, 15.25 +/- 7.44years of experience in their unit) before and after a checkpoint simulation. The checkpoint surveillance operation produced a significant increase (p<0.05) in rated perceived exertion, heart rate, blood lactate concentration, legs ' strength and somatic anxiety, and a significant decrease in blood oxygen saturation and skin temperature values. We concluded that results were consistent with an activation of sympathetic nervous system, triggering a fight-flight response, a chain of intense psychophysiological reactions and a misinterpretation of perceived exertion. Results may help predicting soldiers ' physical and operative behavior in real situations.","[Sanchez-Molina, Joaquin; Javier Clemente-Suarez, Vicente] Univ Europea Madrid, Fac Sports Sci, Tajo St S-N, Madrid 28670, Spain; [Robles-Perez, Jose J.; Javier Clemente-Suarez, Vicente] Studies Ctr Appl Combat CESCA, Toledo, Spain; [Robles-Perez, Jose J.] Spanish Army, Light Forces Head Quarter, Madrid, Spain; [Javier Clemente-Suarez, Vicente] Univ Costa, Grp Invest Cultura Educ & Soc, Barranquilla, Colombia","Clemente-Suarez, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Europea Madrid, Fac Sports Sci, Tajo St S-N, Madrid 28670, Spain.;Clemente-Suarez, VJ (corresponding author), Studies Ctr Appl Combat CESCA, Toledo, Spain.;Clemente-Suarez, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Costa, Grp Invest Cultura Educ & Soc, Barranquilla, Colombia.",vctxente@yahoo.es,"Clemente-Suarez, Vicente Javier/K-7980-2014","Clemente-Suarez, Vicente Javier/0000-0002-2397-2801; Sanchez-Molina, Joaquin/0000-0002-9801-0981",,,"Aguirre-Puig J.

Significant progresses have been made in drugs whose labeled training data is sufficient and available. However, handling data skewness and incompleteness with domain-specific knowledge graph, is still a relatively new territory and an under-explored prospect. In this paper, we present a system KGDDS for node-link-based bio-medical Knowledge Graph curation and visualization, aiding Drug-Drug Similarity measure. Specifically, we reuse existing knowledge bases to alleviate the difficulties in building a high-quality knowledge graph, ranging in size up to 7 million edges. Then we design a prediction model to explore the pharmacology features and knowledge graph features. Finally, we propose a user interaction model to allow the user to better understand the drug properties from a drug similarity perspective and gain insights that are not easily observable in individual drugs. Visual result demonstration and experimental results indicate that KGDDS can bridge the user/caregiver gap by facilitating antibiotics prescription knowledge, and has remarkable applicability, outperforming existing state-of-the-art drug similarity measures.","[Shen, Ying; Yuan, Kaiqi; Dai, Jingchao; Lei, Kai] Peking Univ Shenzhen, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Tang, Buzhou] Harbin Inst Technol Shenzhen, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Yang, Min] Chinese Acad Sci, SIAT, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China","Lei, K (corresponding author), Peking Univ Shenzhen, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",shenying.sz@pku.edu.cn; kqyuan@pku.edu.cn; 1801213351@pku.edu.cn; tangbuzhou@hit.edu.cn; min.yang@siat.ac.cn; leik@pkusz.edu.cn,"Lei, Kai/W-5518-2019","Lei, Kai/0000-0001-9197-895X; Tang, Buzhou/0000-0003-0271-8246; SHEN (chen ying), Ying/0000-0002-3220-904X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61602013]; Shenzhen Fundamental Research Project [JCYJ20170818091546869, JCYJ20160330095313861]; CCF-Tencent Open Research Fund","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61602013), and the Shenzhen Fundamental Research Project (No. JCYJ20170818091546869, JCYJ20160330095313861).

The benign brain tumor does not affect the adjacent normal and healthy tissue but the malignant tumor can affect the neighboring tissues of brain that can lead to the death of person. An early detection of brain tumor can be required to protect the survival of patients. Usually, the brain tumor is detected using MRI scanning method. However, the radiologists are not providing the effective tumor segmentation in MRI image due to the irregular shape of tumors and position of tumor in the brain. Accurate brain tumor segmentation is needed to locate the tumor and it is used to give the correct treatment for a patient and it provides the key to the doctor who must execute the surgery for patient. In this paper, a novel deep learning algorithm (kernel based CNN) with M-SVM is presented to segment the tumor automatically and efficiently. This presented work contains several steps that are preprocessing, feature extraction, image classification and tumor segmentation of brain. The MRI image is smoothed and enhanced by Laplacian of Gaussian filtering method (LoG) with Contrast Limited Adaptive Histrogram Equalization (CLAHE) and feature can be extracted from it based on tumor shape position, shape and surface features in brain. Consequently, the image classification is done using M-SVM depending on the selected features. From MRI image, the tumor is segmented with help of kernel based CNN method.. Experimental results of proposed method can show that this presented technique can executes brain tumor segmentation accurately reaching almost 84% in evaluation with existing algorithms.","[Thillaikkarasi, R.] Salem Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Salem, India; [Saravanan, S.] Muthayammal Engn Coll Rasipuram, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Rasipuram, India","Thillaikkarasi, R (corresponding author), Salem Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Salem, India.",rthillaikkarasiscet@gmail.com,"S, Saravanan/AAA-7962-2021","siddhan, saravanan/0000-0003-2022-6202",,,"Akkus Z, 2017, J DIGIT IMAGING, V30, P449, DOI 10.1007/s10278-017-9983-; Amiri S, 2016, 2016 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES FOR SIGNAL AND IMAGE PROCESSING (ATSIP), P29; Chandra I, 2019, CLUSTER COMPUT, V22, P2517, DOI 10.1007/s10586-018-2329-; Hsu C-H, 2018, J AMB INTEL HUM COMP, P1, DOI 10.1109/SC2.2018.0002; Huang MY, 2014, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V61, P2633, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2014.232541; Isin A, 2016, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V102, P317, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2016.09.40; Islam A, 2013, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V60, P3204, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2013.227138; Kanisha B, 2018, PERSONAL UBIQ COMPUT, P; Kumar PM, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V86, P527, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.04.03; Lokesh S., 2018, NEURAL COMPUT APPL, V2018, P; Mathan K, 2018, DES AUTOM EMBED SYST, P; Mohsen Heba, 2018, Future Computing and Informatics Journal, V3, P68, DOI 10.1016/j.fcij.2017.12.00; Parthasarathy Panchatchram, 2018, World Review of Science, Technology and Sustainable Development, V14, P5; Parthasarathy P, 2018, HEALTH INF SCI SYST, V6, DOI 10.1007/s13755-018-0043-; Parthasarathy P., 2018, INFORM MED UNLOCKE; Parthasarathy P, 2018, HEALTH INF SCI SYST, V6, DOI 10.1007/s13755-018-0058-; Pereira S, 2018, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V11072, P706, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-00931-1_8; Pereira S, 2016, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V35, P1240, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2016.253846; Wang MQ, 2017, 2017 2ND IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND APPLICATIONS (ICCIA), P336, DOI 10.1109/CIAPP.2017.816723; Xing FY, 2016, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V35, P550, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2015.248143",20,30,30,8,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Such data gathers continuously in search space making traditional algorithms infeasible for data mining in real time environment. Hence, feature selection is an important method to lighten the load during processing while inducing a model for mining. However, mining over such high dimensional data leads to formulation of optimal feature subset, which grows exponentially and leads to intractable computational demand. In this paper, a novel lightweight mechanism is used as a feature selection method, which solves the after effects arising with optimal feature selection. The feature selection in big data mining is done using accelerated flower pollination (AFP) algorithm. This method improves the accuracy of feature selection with reduced processing time. The proposed method is tested under larger set of data with high dimensionality to test the performance of proposed method.","[Venkatasalam, K.] Mahendra Engn Coll, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Namakkal 637503, India; [Rajendran, P.] Knowledge Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Kakapalayam, India; [Thangavel, M.] Knowledge Inst Technol, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Kakapalayam, India","Venkatasalam, K (corresponding author), Mahendra Engn Coll, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Namakkal 637503, India.",venkatasalamk@mahendra.info,,,,,"Afzali G.

Conventional features on BCC are concentrated mostly on modeling of channels by using of an efficient measurement technique, wireless transceiver design and then by means of a transmission technique. Particularly, the wireless digital transmitting, developed as a personalized method intended for the body channel, offers wanted to develop flexible and low power BCC systems. With the developing level of wearable communication protocol and applications, there may be an increasingly reliable on an adaptable BCC transmitter that helps both data reconfigure power and power reduction condition. In this paper, an extremely reconfigurable Hamming Encoding Digital Transmitter (HEDT) which works with both reconfigurable data and power reduction condition that supports from two innovative operation conditions is suggested. In a HEDT device, the overall data rate is controlled by the level of Hamming codes designed to make use of in the perfect BCC band of 20-100MHz. The proposed Hamming Encoded Transmission method achieves seven times improved data rate when compared with conventional BCC processors. The next unique implementation technique is based on the usage of Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) of a Hamming encoded HEDT approach. This approach permits the BCC transceiver to use the perfect channel with bandwidth among 40-100MHz. Thereby half the clock rate reduces 40% of overall power utilization. The HEDT system is completely designed in a 65nm CMOS procedure. It uses a primary area of 0.14x0.2mm. When functioning below a data-rate of 60Mb/s (low power) condition, the BCC transmitter utilizes only 1.00mW.","[Vijayalakshmi, S.; Nagarajan, V.] Adhiparasakthi Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Melmaruvathur, Tamil Nadu, India","Vijayalakshmi, S (corresponding author), Adhiparasakthi Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Melmaruvathur, Tamil Nadu, India.",sankarviji7@gmail.com; nagarajanece31@gmail.com,"velmurugan, nagarajan/AAD-6724-2020","velmurugan, nagarajan/0000-0002-1031-0737; sankaran, vijayalakshmi/0000-0003-2146-5838",,,"Anzai D, 2014, IEEE T MICROW THEORY, V62, P183, DOI 10.1109/TMTT.2013.229154; Bae J, 2015, IEEE T MICROW THEORY, V63, P1409, DOI 10.1109/TMTT.2015.240265; Baldus H, 2009, IEEE COMMUN MAG, V47, P172, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2009.511681; Hyoung CH, 2012, ETRI J, V34, P216, DOI 10.4218/etrij.12.0111.017; Maity S, 2018, IEEE CUST INTEGR CI; Movassaghi S, 2014, IEEE COMMUN SURV TUT, V16, P1658, DOI 10.1109/SURV.2013.121313.0006; Musavi F, 2014, IET POWER ELECTRON, V7, P60, DOI 10.1049/iet-pel.2013.004; Namjun C., 2008, IEEE INT SOL STAT CI, P80; Saadeh W, 2017, IEEE J SOLID-ST CIRC, V52, P2690, DOI 10.1109/JSSC.2017.271352; Seyedi M, 2013, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V60, P2067, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2013.225471; Shikada K., 2012, 2 IEEE CPMT S JAP, P; Shinagawa M, 2004, IEEE T INSTRUM MEAS, V53, P1533, DOI 10.1109/TIM.2004.83406; Tengfei Leng, 2011, 2011 Proceedings of International Symposium on Bioelectronics and Bioinformatics (ISBB 2011), P61, DOI 10.1109/ISBB.2011.610764; Timmermann J, 2008, HANN BEITR NACHRICHT, V3, P205, DOI 10.1109/ICUWB.2008.465345; Tsai P-Y., 2015, VLSI DESIGN AUTO TES, P81; Tsou YL, 2015, IEEE SENS J, V15, P3317, DOI 10.1109/JSEN.2014.238635; Viittala H., 2010, INT SYM SPREAD SPECT, P101; Wang JQ, 2009, IEEE T MICROW THEORY, V57, P2464, DOI 10.1109/TMTT.2009.202963; Xie LG, 2013, IEEE WIREL COMMUN, V2; Zhang LH, 2010, INT CONF BIOMED, P778, DOI 10.1109/BMEI.2010.563995; Zimmerman T.

Stomach cancer is an increasing incidence of cancer both in the World as well as in Turkey. The most common method used worldwide for gastric cancer diagnosis is endoscopy. However, definitive diagnosis is made with endoscopic biopsy results. Diagnosis with endoscopy is a very specific and sensitive method. With high-resolution endoscopy it is possible to detect mild discolorations, bulges and structural changes of the surface of the mucosa. However, because the procedures are performed with the eye of a doctor, it is possible that the cancerous areas may be missed and / or incompletely detected. Because of the fact that the cancerous area cannot be completely detected may cause the problem of cancer recurrence after a certain period of surgical intervention. In order to overcome this problem, a computerized decision support system (CDS) has been implemented with the help of specialist physicians and image processing techniques. The performed CDS system works as an assistant to doctors of gastroenterology, helping to identify the cancerous area in the endoscopic images of the scaffold, to take biopsies from these areas and to make a better diagnosis. We believe that gastric cancer will be helpful in determining the area and biopsy samples taken from the patient will be useful in determining the area. It is therefore considered a useful model.","[Yasar, Ali] Selcuk Univ, Guneysinir Vocat Sch Higher Educ, Comp Programming, TR-42190 Guneysinir, Konya, Turkey; [Saritas, Ismail] Selcuk Univ, Fac Technol Elect & Elect Engn, TR-42031 Konya, Turkey; [Korkmaz, Huseyin] Selcuk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol, TR-42031 Konya, Turkey","Yasar, A (corresponding author), Selcuk Univ, Guneysinir Vocat Sch Higher Educ, Comp Programming, TR-42190 Guneysinir, Konya, Turkey.",aliyasar@selcuk.edu.tr,"YASAR, ALI/B-2214-2017; Saritas, Ismail/F-3061-2011","YASAR, ALI/0000-0001-9012-7950; Saritas, Ismail/0000-0002-5743-4593",Selcuk University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Office (BAP) [15101020],This work was supported by the project number 15101020 by Selcuk University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Office (BAP).,"Akbari Hamed, 2009, International Journal of Functional Informatics and Personalised Medicine, V2, P20; Alpert MA, 1997, AM J CARDIOL, V80, P736, DOI 10.1016/S0002-9149(97)00505-; BALLARD DM, 1982, COMPUTER VISION, P14; Brenner Hermann, 2009, V472, P467, DOI 10.1007/978-1-60327-492-0_2; Camps-Valls G, 2005, IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE, V43, P1351, DOI 10.1109/TGRS.2005.84615; Celebi M.

Eighty-seven lung cancer subjects were enrolled in the study, including pathologically proved 47 ADC patients and 40 SCC patients, and 261 texture features were extracted from the manually delineated region of interests on CECT and NECT images respectively. Fisher score was then used to select the effective discriminative texture features between groups, and the selected texture features were adopted to differentiate ADC from SCC using Support Vector Machine and Leave-one-out cross-validation. Both NECT and CECT images could achieve the same best classification accuracy of 95.4%, and most of the informative features were from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix. In addition, CECT images were found with enhanced texture features compared with NECT images, and combining texture features of CECT and NECT images together could further improve the prediction accuracy. Besides the texture feature, the tumor location information also contributed to the differential diagnosis between ADC and SCC.","[Liu, Han; Jing, Bin; Long, Zhuqing; Mo, Xiao; Li, Haiyun] Capital Med Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Beijing 100069, Peoples R China; [Han, Wenjuan] Gen Hosp Chinese Peoples Armed Police Forces, Dept Radiol, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China","Li, HY (corresponding author), Capital Med Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Beijing 100069, Peoples R China.",haiyunli@ccmu.edu.cn,"Jing, Bin/AFN-5046-2022",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [81220108007]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [7174282],"This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 81220108007), Beijing Natural Science Foundation (No. 4122018).

Even though lots of works are done in this area, still improvement in accuracy is required for improving the survival rate of the patient. The proposed method can classify the stages of lung cancer in addition to the detection of lung nodules. There are two parts in the proposed method, the first part is used for classifying normal/abnormal and second part is used for classifying stages of lung cancer. Totally 10 features from the lung region segmented image are considered for detection and classification. The first part of the proposed method classifies the input images with the aid of Naive Bayes classifier as normal or abnormal. The second part of the system classifies the four stages of lung cancer using Neuro Fuzzy classifier with Cuckoo Search algorithm. The results of proposed system show that the rate of accuracy of classification is improved and the results are compared with SVM, Neural Network and Neuro Fuzzy Classifiers.","[Manickavasagam, R.] Alpha Coll Engn, Dept BME, Chennai 124, India; [Selvan, S.] St Peters Coll Engn & Technol, Chennai 54, India","Manickavasagam, R (corresponding author), Alpha Coll Engn, Dept BME, Chennai 124, India.",manick6apr1979@gmail.com; selvanpeter@hotmail.com,,"Manickavasagam, Dr. R/0000-0001-5456-6614",,,"Agam G, 2005, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V24, P486, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2005.84416; Brown MS, 2001, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V20, P1242, DOI 10.1109/42.97491; COSMAN PC, 1993, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V12, P727, DOI 10.1109/42.25112; De Nunzio G, 2011, NUCL INSTRUM METH A, V648, pS103, DOI 10.1016/j.nima.2010.12.08; Dehmeshki J, 2003, ISPA 2003: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 3RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS, PTS 1 AND 2, P39; Dewes P, 2016, EUR J RADIOL, V85, P193, DOI 10.1016/j.ejrad.2015.11.02; Georg Homann MD, 2015, ELSEVIER J ACAD RADI, V22, P505, DOI [10.1016/j.acra.2014.12.005, DOI 10.1016/J.ACRA.2014.12.005; Gomathi M, 2010, PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA STORAGE AND DATA ENGINEERING (DSDE 2010), P150, DOI 10.1109/DSDE.2010.6; Han H, 2015, IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH, V19, P648, DOI 10.1109/JBHI.2014.232887; Mulshine JL, 2015, J AM COLL RADIOL, V12, P390, DOI 10.1016/j.jacr.2014.12.00; Nagatani Y, 2015, EUR J RADIOL, V84, P1401, DOI 10.1016/j.ejrad.2015.03.01; Ritchie AJ, 2016, J THORAC ONCOL, V11, P709, DOI 10.1016/j.jtho.2016.01.02; Samuel CC, 2007, ICCIMA 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND MULTIMEDIA APPLICATIONS, VOL III, PROCEEDINGS, P159, DOI 10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.23; Sui X, 2016, EUR J RADIOL, V85, P564, DOI 10.1016/j.ejrad.2015.12.01; Tariq A, 2013, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2013 FOURTH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICAL IMAGING (CIMI), P49, DOI 10.1109/CIMI.2013.658385; Valente IRS, 2016, COMPUT METH PROG BIO, V124, P91, DOI 10.1016/j.cmpb.2015.10.00; Yasaka K, 2016, EUR J RADIOL, V85, P599, DOI 10.1016/j.ejrad.2016.01.00; Ye XJ, 2009, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V56, P1810, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2009.201702; Zhang H, 2016, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V35, P860, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2015.249814; Zhou SJ, 2014, BIOMED SIGNAL PROCES, V13, P62, DOI 10.1016/j.bspc.2014.03.01",20,11,13,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Although IAQ is not usually monitored, it must be perceived as a relevant issue to follow up for the inhabitants' well-being and comfort for enhanced living environments and occupational health. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has a substantial influence on public health and can be used as an essential index of IAQ. CO2 levels over 1000ppm, indicates an indoor air potential problem. Monitoring CO2 concentration in real-time is essential to detect IAQ issues to quickly intervene in the building. The continuous technological advances in several areas such as Ambient Assisted Living and the Internet of Things (IoT) make it possible to build smart objects with significant capabilities for sensing and connecting. This paper presents the iAirCO(2) system, a solution for CO2 real-time monitoring based on IoT architecture. The iAirCO(2) is composed of a hardware prototype for ambient data collection and a Web and smartphone software for data consulting. In future, it is planned that these data can be accessed by doctors in order to support medical diagnostics. Compared to other solutions, the iAirCO(2) is based on open-source technologies, providing a total Wi-Fi system, with several advantages such as its modularity, scalability, low-cost, and easy installation. The results reveal that the system can generate a viable IAQ appraisal, allowing to anticipate technical interventions that contribute to a healthier living environment.","[Marques, Goncalo; Pitarma, Rui] Polytech Inst Guarda, Unit Inland Dev, Ave Dr Francisco Sa Carneiro 50, P-6300559 Guarda, Portugal; [Ferreira, Cristina Roque] Hosp Ctr & Univ Coimbra CHUC, Dept Imagiol, P-3000075 Coimbra, Portugal","Marques, G (corresponding author), Polytech Inst Guarda, Unit Inland Dev, Ave Dr Francisco Sa Carneiro 50, P-6300559 Guarda, Portugal.",goncalosantosmarques@gmail.com; cris.rcf@gmail.com; rpitarma@ipg.pt,"Marques, Goncalo/N-1805-2018","Marques, Goncalo/0000-0001-5834-6571; Ferreira, Cristina/0000-0003-4476-4646; Pitarma, Rui Antonio/0000-0001-9486-0631",,,"Abraham S, 2014, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V34, P165, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2014.07.09; Awbi H., 2003, VENTILATION BUILDIN; Batty M, 2012, EUR PHYS J-SPEC TOP, V214, P481, DOI 10.1140/epjst/e2012-01703-; Bhattacharya S, 2012, I CONF SENS TECHNOL, P422, DOI 10.1109/ICSensT.2012.646171; Bruce N, 2000, B WORLD HEALTH ORGAN, V78, P107; Caragliu A, 2011, J URBAN TECHNOL, V18, P65, DOI 10.1080/10630732.2011.60111; CHOURABI H, 2012, FRAMEWORK, P228; *ESPR SYST, 2015, ESP8266EX DATASHEE; Hernandez-Munoz JM, 2011, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V6656, P447, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-20898-0_3; Jones AP, 1999, ATMOS ENVIRON, V33, P4535, DOI 10.1016/S1352-2310(99)00272-; Kim JY, 2014, IEEE SENS J, V14, DOI 10.1109/JSEN.2014.235983; Koleva P, 2015, INT C TELECOMMUN MO, P305, DOI 10.1109/TELSKS.2015.735779; Lacis AA, 2010, SCIENCE, V330, P356, DOI 10.1126/science.119065; Lee SC, 2000, CHEMOSPHERE, V41, P109, DOI 10.1016/S0045-6535(99)00396-; Marques G, 2018, INT J ENV RES PUB HE, V15, DOI 10.3390/ijerph1504082; Marques G, 2017, ADV INTELL SYST, V570, P785, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-56538-5_7; Marques G, 2016, INT J ENV RES PUB HE, V13, DOI 10.3390/ijerph1311115; Marquis GB, 2016, IIW RECOMMENDATION; Myers SS, 2014, NATURE, V510, P139, DOI 10.1038/nature1317; NEUBURG M, 2013, IOS 7 PROGRAMMING F; Pitarma R, 2017, J MED SYST, V41, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0667-; Ramachandran G, 2005, J OCCUP ENVIRON HYG, V2, P553, DOI 10.1080/1545962050032445; Salamone F, 2017, SENSORS-BASEL, V17, DOI 10.3390/s1705102; Salamone F, 2015, SENSORS-BASEL, V15, P13012, DOI 10.3390/s15061301; SATISH U, 2012, ENV HLT; Schaffers H, 2011, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V6656, P431, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-20898-0_3; Scheff P A, 2000, Appl Occup Environ Hyg, V15, P82; Seguel JM, 2017, AM J LIFESTYLE MED, V11, P284, DOI 10.1177/155982761665334; Seppanen OA, 1999, INDOOR AIR, V9, P226, DOI 10.1111/j.1600-0668.1999.00003.; SRIVATSA P, 2016, NAT C NCPC; Srivatsa P., 2016, SENSORS AND ACTUATOR, P1; Tran T.

However, the automatic extraction of information within these notes is challenging due to their narrative style. In this context, our goal was to identify clusters of patients based on fourteen comorbidities related to obesity, automatically extracted with the cTAKES tool from the i2b2 Obesity Challenge data. Furthermore, results were compared with clusters obtained from experts' annotated data. The sparse K-means algorithms were used in both experiment at two levels: at the first level, three clusters were found, and at the second, new clusters were found by applying the same algorithm to each of the clusters from the former level. The results show that three types of clusters could be identified based on the number of comorbidities and the percentage of patients suffering from them. Diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and depression were the diseases with the highest weights contributing to the cluster distribution.","[Reategui, Ruth; Ratte, Sylvie] Ecole Technol Super, 1100 Notre Dame St West, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Reategui, Ruth; Bautista-Valarezo, Estefania; Duque, Victor] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, San Cayetano Alto 1101608, Loja, Ecuador","Duque, V (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Particular Loja, San Cayetano Alto 1101608, Loja, Ecuador.",rmreategui@utpl.edu.ec; Sylvie.Ratte@etsmtls.ca; mebautista@utpl.edu.ec; victorduquetf@gmail.com,"RattÃ©, Sylvie/ABU-0444-2022; Bautista, Estefanía/ABC-7656-2021","Bautista, Estefanía/0000-0002-6012-3403; Reategui, Ruth/0000-0002-7304-4413; Exposito Duque, Victor/0000-0002-2199-2454",,,"Ahmad T, 2014, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V64, P1765, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2014.07.97; [Anonymous], 2009, UMLS REF MA; Bourdin A, 2014, J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUN, V134, P1043, DOI 10.1016/j.jaci.2014.04.03; BRUCE SG, 2011, PREV CHRONIC DIS, V; Bukhanov N, 2017, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V108, P2478, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2017.05.07; Canto JG, 2011, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V306, P2120, DOI 10.1001/jama.2011.165; Chen CZ, 2014, LUNG, V192, P889, DOI 10.1007/s00408-014-9646-; Dixon JB, 2003, ARCH INTERN MED, V163, P2058, DOI 10.1001/archinte.163.17.205; Figueroa RL, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0548-; Foster MC, 2008, AM J KIDNEY DIS, V52, P39, DOI 10.1053/j.ajkd.2008.03.00; Gao Y, 2015, PLOS ONE, V10, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.014443; Guh DP, 2009, BMC PUBLIC HEALTH, V9, DOI 10.1186/1471-2458-9-8; Joosten SA, 2012, RESPIROLOGY, V17, P99, DOI 10.1111/j.1440-1843.2011.02037.; Kramer CK, 2013, ANN INTERN MED, V159, P758, DOI 10.7326/0003-4819-159-11-201312030-0000; LaGrotte C, 2016, INT J OBESITY, V40, P1397, DOI 10.1038/ijo.2016.8; Laing ST, 2015, J AM HEART ASSOC, V4, DOI 10.1161/JAHA.114.00154; Leslie WS, 2007, QJM-INT J MED, V100, P395, DOI 10.1093/qjmed/hcm04; Luppino FS, 2010, ARCH GEN PSYCHIAT, V67, P220, DOI 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.; Mamudu HM, 2016, PREV MED, V88, P140, DOI 10.1016/j.ypmed.2016.04.00; National Library of Medicine (US, 2016, OV SNOMED C; Peppard PE, 2013, AM J EPIDEMIOL, V177, P1006, DOI 10.1093/aje/kws34; Poirier P, 2006, ARTERIOSCL THROM VAS, V26, P968, DOI 10.1161/01.ATV.0000216787.85457.f; Reategui R, 2018, BMC MED INFORM DECIS, V18, DOI 10.1186/s12911-018-0654-; Roberts RE, 2003, INT J OBESITY, V27, P514, DOI 10.1038/sj.ijo.080220; Rocha A, 2014, INFORM HEALTH SOC CA, V39, P1, DOI 10.3109/17538157.2013.82720; Serrano-Pariente J, 2015, ALLERGY, V70, P1139, DOI 10.1111/all.1265; Shivade C, 2014, J AM MED INFORM ASSN, V21, P221, DOI 10.1136/amiajnl-2013-00193; Sutherland ER, 2012, PLOS ONE, V7, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.003663; Tibshirani R, 2001, J ROY STAT SOC B, V63, P411, DOI 10.1111/1467-9868.0029; Uzuner O, 2009, J AM MED INFORM ASSN, V16, P561, DOI 10.1197/jamia.M311; van der Esch M, 2015, OSTEOARTHR CARTILAGE, V23, P544, DOI 10.1016/j.joca.2015.01.00; Vavougios GD, 2016, J SLEEP RES, V25, P31, DOI 10.1111/jsr.1234; Willett WC, 1999, NEW ENGL J MED, V341, P427, DOI 10.1056/NEJM19990805341060; Witten DM, 2010, J AM STAT ASSOC, V105, P713, DOI 10.1198/jasa.2010.tm0941; Wolf J, 2007, NUTR METAB CARDIOVAS, V17, P233, DOI 10.1016/j.numecd.2006.12.00",35,4,4,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

J,"Saboul, D1;  Hautier, C",,,,"Saboul, Damien; Hautier, Christophe",,,A New Algorithm to Reduce and Individualize HRV Recording Time,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,HRV; Smartphone application; Optimization; Individualization; Recording time; Monitoring,HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; TRAINING ADAPTATION; EXERCISE; AGREEMENT,"The aim of the present work was to propose a Smartphone algorithm to analyze, in real time, the evolution of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) in order to individualize and reduce the recording time according to the specificities of each user. During HRV recording, a new RMSSD value is calculated each time a new RR is captured. The recording process stops once an acceptable stability of HRV is reached. This new method was tested on 3 groups of 15 subjects (cardiac patients, sedentary employees and national-level athletes) and compared with the gold standard method (5min HRV recording time). The RMSSD indices provided by the short method and by the gold standard method (respectively 62.1 +/- 43.7ms vs. 62.7 +/- 44.1ms) showed no significant differences. In addition, a very strong correlation was observed between RMSSD values obtained by the 2 methods (n=45; R=0.998; p<0.001). Routine duration of the new method was significantly shorter with a time-savings of 2min (178 +/- 51s vs. 300s; p<0.05). This new algorithm seems to adapt perfectly to each subject, and it can detect the stability phase for HRV measurements during the recording process. Algorithm provides an adapted and personal routine duration that can evolve each day depending on parameters such as fatigue or stress level that are known to influence HRV. This solution can be easily implemented in a smartphone application and seems particularly suitable for performing daily HRV monitoring in field conditions.","[Saboul, Damien] Be Studys, Route Meyrin 123, CH-1219 Geneva, Switzerland; [Saboul, Damien; Hautier, Christophe] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, Interuniv Lab Human Movement Sci LIBM, EA 7424, Lyon, France","Saboul, D (corresponding author), Be Studys, Route Meyrin 123, CH-1219 Geneva, Switzerland.;Saboul, D (corresponding author), Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, Interuniv Lab Human Movement Sci LIBM, EA 7424, Lyon, France.",dsaboul@free.fr,,"Saboul, Damien/0000-0003-1891-9077",,,"AKSELROD S, 1981, SCIENCE, V213, P220, DOI 10.1126/science.616604; Altini M, 2016, IEEE ENG MED BIO, P2610, DOI 10.1109/EMBC.2016.759126; Aubert AE, 2003, SPORTS MED, V33, P889, DOI 10.2165/00007256-200333120-0000; Behrens K, 2015, HERZ, V40, P61, DOI 10.1007/s00059-013-4037-; BLAND JM, 1986, LANCET, V1, P307, DOI 10.1016/s0140-6736(86)90837-; Bourdillon N, 2017, FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ, V11, DOI 10.3389/fnins.2017.0045; Buchheit M, 2014, FRONT PHYSIOL, V5, DOI 10.3389/fphys.2014.0007; Camm AJ, 1996, EUR HEART J, V17, P35; Cinaz B, 2013, PERS UBIQUIT COMPUT, V17, P229, DOI 10.1007/s00779-011-0466-; Esco MR, 2014, J SPORT SCI MED, V13, P53; Flatt AA, 2016, CLIN PHYSIOL FUNCT I, V36, P331, DOI 10.1111/cpf.1223; Flatt AA, 2013, J HUM KINET, V39, P85, DOI 10.2478/hukin-2013-007; Hautala AJ, 2009, NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV R, V33, P107, DOI 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.04.00; Jarczok MN, 2013, NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV R, V37, P1810, DOI 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.07.00; Kiviniemi AM, 2010, MED SCI SPORT EXER, V42, P1355, DOI 10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181cd5f3; Le Meur Y, 2013, MED SCI SPORT EXER, V45, P2061, DOI 10.1249/MSS.0b013e318298012; Murad Khalil, 2012, Congest Heart Fail, V18, P192, DOI 10.1111/j.1751-7133.2011.00282.; Nakamura FY, 2015, J SPORT SCI MED, V14, P60; Orsila R, 2008, INT J OCCUP SAF ERGO, V14, P275, DOI 10.1080/10803548.2008.1107676; Pereira LA, 2016, INT J SPORT PHYSIOL, V11, P154, DOI 10.1123/ijspp.2015-003; Perrotta AS, 2017, J STRENGTH COND RES, V31, P2296, DOI 10.1519/JSC.000000000000184; Plews DJ, 2017, INT J SPORT PHYSIOL, V12, P1324, DOI 10.1123/ijspp.2016-066; Plews DJ, 2014, INT J SPORT PHYSIOL, V9, P783, DOI [10.1123/IJSPP.2013-0455, 10.1123/ijspp.2013-0455; Plews DJ, 2013, INT J SPORT PHYSIOL, V8, P688, DOI 10.1123/ijspp.8.6.68; Plews DJ, 2013, SPORTS MED, V43, P773, DOI 10.1007/s40279-013-0071-; Saboul D, 2014, EUR J SPORT SCI, V14, pS282, DOI 10.1080/17461391.2012.69111; Saboul D, 2013, EUR J SPORT SCI, V13, P534, DOI 10.1080/17461391.2013.76794; Stanley J, 2013, SPORTS MED, V43, P1259, DOI 10.1007/s40279-013-0083-",28,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The system permits the evaluation of the volumes of grey matter in subjects such as the AD or the conditions related to it and are compared in an automated manner with the healthy controls in the entire brain. The article also reviews the findings of the VBM that are related to various stages of the AD and also its prodrome known as the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). For this work, the Ada Boost classifier has been proposed to be a good selector of feature that brings down the classification error's upper bound. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) had been employed for the dimensionality reduction and for improving efficiency. The PCA is a powerful, as well as a reliable, tool in data analysis. Calculating fitness scores will be an independent process. For this reason, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) along with a greedy search may be computed easily along with some high-performance systems of computing. The primary goal of this work was to identify better collections or permutations of the classifiers that are weak to build stronger ones. The results of the experiment prove that the GAs is one more alternative technique used for boosting the permutation of weak classifiers identified in Ada Boost which can produce some better solutions compared to the classical Ada Boost.","[Saravanakumar, S.] Anna Univ, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Thangaraj, P.] Bannari Amman Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Sathyamangalam, Erode, India","Saravanakumar, S (corresponding author), Anna Univ, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.",sar112113118@gmail.com,"kumar, saravana s/B-5229-2018",,,,"Beheshti I, 2017, COMPUT BIOL MED, V83, P109, DOI 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.02.01; Chyzhyk D, 2014, NEUROCOMPUTING, V128, P73, DOI 10.1016/j.neucom.2013.01.06; Gorji HT, 2015, NEUROSCIENCE, V305, P361, DOI 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.08.01; Hirata Y, 2005, NEUROSCI LETT, V382, P269, DOI 10.1016/j.neulet.2005.03.03; Jin R., 2003, NEW BOOSTING ALGORI; Karas GB, 2003, NEUROIMAGE, V18, P895, DOI 10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00041-; Mahanand B.S., 2015, COGN COMP INF PROC C, P; Mikki M., 2013, THESI; Nandi D, 2015, J IMAGE MIN INT, V1, P65, DOI DOI 10.1504/IJIM.2015.07002; Popuri K, 2018, NEUROIMAGE-CLIN, V18, P802, DOI 10.1016/j.nicl.2018.03.00; Yalabik I, 2007, IEEE C ICIS 22 INT S, P; Zhang Dezhen, 2008, 2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE 2008), P1044, DOI 10.1109/CSSE.2008.104; Zhang YH, 2018, J AMB INTEL HUM COMP, V9, P1039, DOI 10.1007/s12652-017-0509-; Zhang YD, 2015, FRONT COMPUT NEUROSC, V9, DOI 10.3389/fncom.2015.0006; Zhang YD, 2014, PROG ELECTROMAGN RES, V144, P171, DOI 10.2528/PIER1312131",15,6,6,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

IoT has also been recognised for its revolution in reshaping modern healthcare with aspiring wide range prospects, including economical, technological and social. This study aims to establish IoT-based smart home security solutions for real-time health monitoring technologies in telemedicine architecture. A multilayer taxonomy is driven and conducted in this study. In the first layer, a comprehensive analysis on telemedicine, which focuses on the client and server sides, shows that other studies associated with IoT-based smart home applications have several limitations that remain unaddressed. Particularly, remote patient monitoring in healthcare applications presents various facilities and benefits by adopting IoT-based smart home technologies without compromising the security requirements and potentially large number of risks. An extensive search is conducted to identify articles that handle these issues, related applications are comprehensively reviewed and a coherent taxonomy for these articles is established. A total number of (n=3064) are gathered between 2007 and 2017 for most reliable databases, such as ScienceDirect, Web of Science and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineer Xplore databases. Then, the articles based on IoT studies that are associated with telemedicine applications are filtered. Nine articles are selected and classified into two categories. The first category, which accounts for 22.22% (n=2/9), includes surveys on telemedicine articles and their applications. The second category, which accounts for 77.78% (n=7/9), includes articles on the client and server sides of telemedicine architecture. The collected studies reveal the essential requirement in constructing another taxonomy layer and review IoT-based smart home security studies. Therefore, IoT-based smart home security features are introduced and analysed in the second layer. The security of smart home design based on IoT applications is an aspect that represents a crucial matter for general occupants of smart homes, in which studies are required to provide a better solution with patient security, privacy protection and security of users' entities from being stolen or compromised. Innovative technologies have dispersed limitations related to this matter. The existing gaps and trends in this area should be investigated to provide valuable visions for technical environments and researchers. Thus, 67 articles are obtained in the second layer of our taxonomy and are classified into six categories. In the first category, 25.37% (n=17/67) of the articles focus on architecture design. In the second category, 17.91% (n=12/67) includes security analysis articles that investigate the research status in the security area of IoT-based smart home applications. In the third category, 10.44% (n=7/67) includes articles about security schemes. In the fourth category, 17.91% (n=12/67) comprises security examination. In the fifth category, 13.43% (n=9/67) analyses security protocols. In the final category, 14.92% (n=10/67) analyses the security framework. Then, the identified basic characteristics of this emerging field are presented and provided in the following aspects. Open challenges experienced on the development of IoT-based smart home security are addressed to be adopted fully in telemedicine applications. Then, the requirements are provided to increase researcher's interest in this study area. On this basis, a number of recommendations for different parties are described to provide insights on the next steps that should be considered to enhance the security of smart homes based on IoT. A map matching for both taxonomies is developed in this study to determine the novel risks and benefits of IoT-based smart home security for real-time remote health monitoring within client and server sides in telemedicine applications.","[Talal, Mohammed] Univ Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia UTHM, Dept Commun Engn, Fac Elect & Elect Engn, Parit Raja, Malaysia; [Zaidan, A.

This research offers a novel approach for estimating the smart medical devices (SMDs) selection process in a group decision making (GDM) in a vague decision environment. The complexity of the selected decision criteria for the smart medical devices is a significant feature of this analysis. To simulate these processes, a methodology that combines neutrosophics using bipolar numbers with Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) under GDM is suggested. Neutrosophics with TOPSIS approach is applied in the decision making process to deal with the vagueness, incomplete data and the uncertainty, considering the decisions criteria in the data collected by the decision makers (DMs). In this research, the stress is placed upon the choosing of sugar analyzing smart medical devices for diabetics' patients. The main objective is to present the complications of the problem, raising interest among specialists in the healthcare industry and assessing smart medical devices under different evaluation criteria. The problem is formulated as a multi criteria decision type with seven alternatives and seven criteria, and then edited as a multi criteria decision model with seven alternatives and seven criteria. The results of the neutrosophics with TOPSIS model are analyzed, showing that the competence of the acquired results and the rankings are sufficiently stable. The results of the suggested method are also compared with the neutrosophic extensions AHP and MOORA models in order to validate and prove the acquired results. In addition, we used the SPSS program to check the stability of the variations in the rankings by the Spearman coefficient of correlation. The selection methodology is applied on a numerical case, to prove the validity of the suggested approach.","[Abdel-Basset, Mohamed; Gamal, Abduallah] Zagazig Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Dept Operat Res, Sharqiyah, Egypt; [Manogaran, Gunasekaran] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Smarandache, Florentin] Univ New Mexico, Math & Sci Dept, Gallup, NM 87301 USA","Abdel-Basset, M (corresponding author), Zagazig Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Dept Operat Res, Sharqiyah, Egypt.",analyst_mohamed@zu.edu.eg; gmanogaran@ucdavis.edu; abduallahgamal@gmail.com; smarand@unm.edu,"Smarandache, Florentin/K-3160-2013; Gamal, Abduallah/ABI-5916-2020; Abdel-Basset, Mohamed/AAH-2833-2019","Smarandache, Florentin/0000-0002-5560-5926; Gamal, Abduallah/0000-0002-3819-0714; Abdel-Basset, Mohamed/0000-0003-1102-1387; Abdel-Basset, Mohamed/0000-0002-2794-3936",,,"Abdel-Basset M, 2019, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V90, P489, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.08.03; Abdel-Basset M, 2018, J AMB INTEL HUM COMP, V9, P1427, DOI 10.1007/s12652-017-0548-; Abdel-Basset M, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V89, P19, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.06.02; Abdel-Basset M, 2018, DES AUTOM EMBED SYST, V22, P257, DOI 10.1007/s10617-018-9203-; Abdel-Basset M, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V86, P12, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.03.01; Abdel-Basset M, 2018, J INTELL FUZZY SYST, V34, P4213, DOI 10.3233/JIFS-17195; Abdel-Basset M, 2018, SYMMETRY-BASEL, V10, DOI 10.3390/sym1006022; Abdel-Basset M, 2018, SYMMETRY-BASEL, V10, DOI 10.3390/sym1004010; Abdel-Basset M, 2018, SYMMETRY-BASEL, V10, DOI 10.3390/sym1004011; Abdel-Basset M, 2018, MEASUREMENT, V124, P47, DOI 10.1016/j.measurement.2018.04.00; Abdel-Basset M, 2018, SOFT COMPUT, V22, P6629, DOI 10.1007/s00500-017-2758-; ATANASSOV KT, 1986, FUZZY SET SYST, V20, P87, DOI 10.1016/S0165-0114(86)80034-; Aytac Adalinodot Esra, 2017, Journal of Industrial Engineering International, V13, P229, DOI 10.1007/s40092-016-0175-; Basset MA, 2018, BENCHMARKING, V25, P2546, DOI 10.1108/BIJ-08-2017-023; Brauers WKM, 2006, CONTROL CYBERN, V35, P44; Brauers WKM, 2010, TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO, V16, P5, DOI 10.3846/tede.2010.0; Chang V, 2019, INFORM SYST FRONT, V21, P27, DOI 10.1007/s10796-018-9853-; Lupianez FG, 2009, KYBERNETES, V38, P621, DOI 10.1108/0368492091094484; Ho W, 2010, EUR J OPER RES, V202, P16, DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2009.05.00; Joshi D, 2016, EUR J OPER RES, V248, P183, DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2015.06.04; Kharal A, 2014, NEW MATH NAT COMPUT, V10, P143, DOI 10.1142/S179300571450007; Liang RX, 2018, NEURAL COMPUT APPL, V30, P3383, DOI 10.1007/s00521-017-2925-; Manemaran S.V., 2010, INT J COMPUTING APPL, V9, P7, DOI [10.5120/1440-1948, DOI 10.5120/1440-1948; Metwalli M.

To maximize quality and value, perioperative care is changing through new technological developments. In this context, knowledge management practices will enable future transformation and enhancements in healthcare services. By performing a data science and knowledge management research in the perioperative department at Hospital Dr. Nelio Mendonca between 2013 and 2015, this paper describes its principal results. This study showed perioperative decision-making improvement by integrating data science tools on the perioperative electronic system (PES). Before the PES implementation only 1,2% of the nurses registered the preoperative visit and after 87,6% registered it. Regarding the patient features it was possible to assess anxiety and pain levels. A future conceptual model for perioperative decision support systems grounded on data science should be considered as a knowledge management tool.","[Baptista, Marcia] Santiago de Compostela Univ, Informat Technol Res Dept, Santiago, Spain; [Vasconcelos, Jose Braga] Univ Atlantica, Knowledge Management & Engn Res Grp, Barcarena, Portugal; [Vasconcelos, Jose Braga] Univ Lisbon, CAPP, Lisbon, Portugal; [Rocha, Alvaro] Univ Coimbra, Dept Engn Informat, Coimbra, Portugal; [Silva, Rita] Hosp Dr Nelio Mendonca, Bloco Operatorio, Madeira, Portugal; [Carvalho, Joao Vidal] Politecn Porto, ISCAP, CEOS PP, Sao Mamede de Infesta, Portugal; [Jardim, Helena Goncalves] Madeira Univ, Hlth Higher Sch, Coimbra, Portugal; [Quintal, Antonio] Univ Madeira, Madeira, Portugal","Baptista, M (corresponding author), Santiago de Compostela Univ, Informat Technol Res Dept, Santiago, Spain.",marciabatista12@gmail.com; jose.braga.vasconcelos@uatlantica.pt; amrocha@dei.uc.pt; ritamlbs@hotmail.com; cajvidal@iscap.ipp.pt; hjardim@uma.pt; ajdomq@gmail.com,"Rocha, Álvaro/O-3273-2013; de Vasconcelos, José Braga/N-5652-2019; de Carvalho, Joao Vidal/AAI-4857-2021; Carvalho, João Vidal/M-3839-2017; Goncalves Jardim, Maria Helena de Agrela/K-5353-2014","Rocha, Álvaro/0000-0002-0750-8187; de Vasconcelos, José Braga/0000-0001-7580-1281; de Carvalho, Joao Vidal/0000-0001-9727-0557; Carvalho, João Vidal/0000-0001-9727-0557; silva, rita/0000-0002-2521-975X; Goncalves Jardim, Maria Helena de Agrela/0000-0001-7622-1449",,,"Bhavnani SP, 2016, CIRC-CARDIOVASC QUAL, V9, P683, DOI 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.116.00308; Carvalho JV, 2019, J BUS RES, V94, P388, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.12.01; Doebbeling Bradley N, 2012, AMIA Annu Symp Proc, V2012, P15; du Plessis M, 2005, INT J INFORM MANAGE, V25, P193, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2004.12.00; El Morr C., 2010, KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT, P490, DOI [10.4018/978-1-61520-670-4.ch023, DOI 10.4018/978-1-61520-670-4.CH023; Gupta B, 2000, IND MANAGE DATA SYST, V100, P17, DOI 10.1108/0263557001027301; Jacques J., 2008, ADV PATIENT SAFETY N, V; Khalifa M, 2015, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V63, P198, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.33; Menachemi N, 2011, RISK MANAG HEALTHC P, V4, P47, DOI 10.2147/RMHP.S1298; Rocha A, 2014, INFORM HEALTH SOC CA, V39, P1, DOI 10.3109/17538157.2013.82720; Sweeney P., 2010, NURSING, V9; Vedula SS, 2017, INNOV SURG SCI, V2, P109, DOI 10.1515/iss-2017-000; WHO, 2012, GLOBAL OBSERVATORY E, V",13,2,2,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Wireless body area networks (WBANs) provide a simple and low-cost strategy for health monitoring and telemedicine of the elderly. Many authentication schemes based on WBAN have been presented to address the sensitivity and privacy of collected data and the open characteristic of wireless networks. Wu et al. recently presented an efficient anonymous authentication scheme for WBANs, in which a one-side bilinear pairing methodology was applied to reduce the burden on the WBAN client side. However, we demonstrate that their scheme suffers from client impersonation attacks and that the adversary can easily forge a legal client to access the network service. In this paper, we analyze the limitations of Wu et al.'s scheme and design a novel mutual authentication scheme for WBANs that adopt asymmetric bilinear pairing to enhance security. Results of security and performance analyses reveal that the new scheme offers more effective security, better performance, and higher efficiency than Wu et al.'s scheme. We also provide a formal security proof of the protocol by using BAN authentication logic.","[Chen, Rui] Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Rui; Peng, Dezhong] Sichuan Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Peng, Dezhong] Chengdu Ruibei Yingte Informat Technol Ltd Co, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Peng, DZ (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Peng, DZ (corresponding author), Chengdu Ruibei Yingte Informat Technol Ltd Co, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",crs1934@hotmail.com; pengdz@scu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1435213, 61172180]; Chengdu International Cooperation Project [2016-GH02-00048-HZ, 2015-GH02-00041-HZ]; General Project of Education Department in Sichuan [18ZB0485]","This study was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number U1435213 and 61172180), and Chengdu International Cooperation Project (grant number 2016-GH02-00048-HZ and 2015-GH02-00041-HZ), and General Project of Education Department in Sichuan (grant number 18ZB0485).","Al-Riyami SS, 2003, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V2894, P45; [Anonymous], 2012, IEEE STANDARD LOC 1; BURROWS M, 1990, ACM T COMPUT SYST, V8, P18, DOI 10.1145/77648.7764; Drira W., 2012, 2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom), P78, DOI 10.1109/TrustCom.2012.3; ELGAMAL T, 1985, IEEE T INFORM THEORY, V31, P469, DOI 10.1109/TIT.1985.105707; He DB, 2017, IEEE SYST J, V11, P2590, DOI 10.1109/JSYST.2016.254480; He DB, 2018, IEEE SYST J, V12, P64, DOI 10.1109/JSYST.2015.242862; He DB, 2015, MULTIMEDIA SYST, V21, P49, DOI 10.1007/s00530-013-0346-; He DB, 2015, INFORM SCIENCES, V321, P263, DOI 10.1016/j.ins.2015.02.01; He DB, 2015, IEEE COMMUN MAG, V53, P71, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2015.701051; He DB, 2015, IEEE SYST J, V9, P816, DOI 10.1109/JSYST.2014.230151; Huang XY, 2014, IEEE T DEPEND SECURE, V11, P568, DOI 10.1109/TDSC.2013.229711; Jang CS, 2008, SECTECH: 2008 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SECURITY TECHNOLOGY, PROCEEDINGS, P202, DOI 10.1109/SecTech.2008.3; Kang B., 2017, MOBILE INFORM SYSTEM, V201; Liu JW, 2014, IEEE T PARALL DISTR, V25, P332, DOI 10.1109/TPDS.2013.14; Lu Zhang, 2013, 2013 5th International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems, P637, DOI 10.1109/INCoS.2013.12; Menezes A., 1991, PROC ANN ACM S THEOR, P8; Monton E, 2008, IET COMMUN, V2, P215, DOI 10.1049/iet-com:2007004; RIVEST RL, 1978, COMMUN ACM, V21, P120, DOI 10.1145/359340.35934; Seyedi M, 2013, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V60, P2067, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2013.225471; Toorani M, 2016, INT J COMMUN SYST, V29, P2471, DOI 10.1002/dac.312; Toorani M, 2015, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V8976, P245, DOI 10.1007/978-3-662-48051-9_1; Wang CZ, 2015, J MED SYST, V39, DOI 10.1007/s10916-015-0331-; WHO, 2016, SAUDI MED J, V37, P71; Wu LB, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0491-; Xiong H, 2015, IEEE T INF FOREN SEC, V10, P1442, DOI 10.1109/TIFS.2015.241439; Xiong H, 2014, IEEE T INF FOREN SEC, V9, P2327, DOI 10.1109/TIFS.2014.236355; Zhao ZG, 2014, J MED SYST, V38, DOI 10.1007/s10916-014-0013-; Zimmerman TG, 1996, IBM SYST J, V35, P609, DOI 10.1147/sj.353.060",29,10,10,1,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Phonetic properties are processed in both linguistic and motor stages of word production. Four phonetically dissimilar phonemic structures BA, FO, LE, and RY were chosen as covert speech tasks. Ten neurologically healthy volunteers with the age range of 21-33 participated in this experiment. Participants were asked to covertly speak a phonemic structure when they heard an auditory cue. EEG was recorded with 64 electrodes at 2048 samples/s. Initially, one-second trials were used, which contained linguistic and motor imagery activities. The four-class true positive rate was calculated. In the next stage, 312ms trials were used to exclude covert articulation from analysis. By eliminating the covert articulation stage, the four-class grand average classification accuracy dropped from 96.4% to 94.5%. The most valuable features emerge after Auditory cue recognition (100ms post onset), and within the 70-128Hz frequency range. The most significant identified brain regions were the Prefrontal Cortex (linked to stimulus driven executive control), Wernicke's area (linked to Phonological code retrieval), the right IFG, and Broca's area (linked to syllabification). Alpha and Beta band oscillations associated with motor imagery do not contain enough information to fully reflect the complexity of speech movements. Over 90% of the most class-dependent features were in the 30-128Hz range, even during the covert articulation stage. As a result, compared to linguistic functions, the contribution of motor imagery of articulation in class separability of covert speech tasks from EEG data is negligible.","[Jahangiri, Amir; Sepulveda, Francisco] Univ Essex, Sch Comp Sci & Elect Engn, BCI NE Lab, Colchester, Essex, England","Jahangiri, A (corresponding author), Univ Essex, Sch Comp Sci & Elect Engn, BCI NE Lab, Colchester, Essex, England.",ajahan@essex.ac.uk; fsepulv@essex.ac.uk,,,,,"[Anonymous], 2012, CORTICAL FUNCTIONS ; Asplund CL, 2010, NAT NEUROSCI, V13, P507, DOI 10.1038/nn.250; Baker SN, 2003, J PHYSIOL-LONDON, V550, P529, DOI 10.1113/jphysiol.2003.04567; Bekhti Y., 2016, 6 INT WORKSH PATT RE, P3; BioSemi I., 2001, ACTIVE 2 MULTICHANN; Blanco S, 1996, PHYS REV E, V54, P6661, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevE.54.666; Brumberg JS, 2011, FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ, V5, DOI 10.3389/fnins.2011.0006; Chakrabarti S, 2015, BIOMED ENG LETT, V5, P10, DOI 10.1007/s13534-015-0175-; Chen X., 2014, J APPL MATH, V2014, P1, DOI DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.000077; Chi X., 2011, INT J BIOELECTROMAGN, V13, P20; CREUTZFELDT O, 1989, EXP BRAIN RES, V77, P451, DOI 10.1007/BF0024960; Cummings A, 2016, BRAIN RES, V1635, P71, DOI 10.1016/j.brainres.2016.01.01; Darvas F, 2010, NEUROIMAGE, V49, P930, DOI 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.08.04; DAVIES DL, 1979, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V1, P224, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.1979.476690; Delorme A, 2004, J NEUROSCI METH, V134, P9, DOI 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2003.10.00; Dhanjal NS, 2008, J NEUROSCI, V28, P9969, DOI 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2607-08.200; Flinker A, 2010, J NEUROSCI, V30, P16643, DOI 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1809-10.201; Fry D.

J,"Natarajan, A1;  Kumarasamy, S",,,,"Natarajan, Aparna; Kumarasamy, Sathiyasekar",,,Efficient Segmentation of Brain Tumor Using FL-SNM with a Metaheuristic Approach to Optimization,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Kuan filter; Diffusion filter; Linear process; Optimization; Discriminant analysis; Fuzzy logic; Spiking neuron model; Swarm intelligence,MRI,"Nowadays, automatic tumor detection from brain images is extremely significant for many diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes, due to the unpredictable shape and appearance of tumors. In medical image analysis, the automatic segmentation of tumors from brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is the most critical issue. Existing research has some limitations, such as high processing time and lower accuracy, because of the time required for the training process. In this research, a new automatic segmentation process is introduced using machine learning and a swarm intelligence scheme. Here, a fuzzy logic with spiking neuron model (FL-SNM) is proposed for segmenting the brain tumor region in MR images. Initially, input images are preprocessed to remove Gaussian and Poisson noise using a modified Kuan filter (MKF). In the MKF, the optimal selection of the minimum MSE of image pixels is achieved using a random search algorithm (RSA), which improves the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Then, the image is smoothed using an anisotropic diffusion filter (ADF) to reduce the over-filtering problem. Afterwards, to extract statistical texture features, Fisher's linear-discriminant analysis (FLDA) is used. Finally, extracted features are transferred to the FL-SNM process and this scheme effectively segments the tumor region. In FL-SNM, the consequent parameters such as weight and bias play an important role in segmenting the region. Therefore, optimizing the weight parameter values using a chicken behavior-based swarm intelligence (CSI) algorithm, is proposed. The proposed (FL-SNM) scheme attained better performance in terms of high accuracy (94.87%), sensitivity (92.07%), specificity (99.34%), precision rate (89.36%), recall rate (88.39%), F-measure (95.06%), G-mean (95.63%), and DSC rate (91.2%), compared to existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and hierarchical self-organizing maps (HSOMs).","[Natarajan, Aparna] SRS Coll Engn & Technol, Dept EEE, Salem, India; [Kumarasamy, Sathiyasekar] SA Engn Coll, Dept EEE, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India","Natarajan, A (corresponding author), SRS Coll Engn & Technol, Dept EEE, Salem, India.",aparnan2101@gmail.com; ksathiyasekar@gmail.com,"Sathiyasekar, Kumarasamy/AAB-7284-2019",,,,"Acharya1 J., 2013, INT J COMPUTER SCI M, V2, P121; Amin S.

Here, the fuzzy clustering method is used and which is based on transition region extraction for effective image segmentation. Moreover, Fuzzy C-Means Clustering algorithm is used to categorize the transitional region features from the feature of lung cancer image. In this work, Otsu thresholding method is used for extracting the transition region from lung cancer image. Moreover, the right edge image and the morphological thinning operation are used for enhancing the performance of segmentation. In addition, the morphological cleaning and the image region filling operations are performed over an edge lung cancer image for getting the object regions. In addition, we also propose a new incremental classification algorithm which combines the existing Association Rule Mining (ARM), the standard Decision Tree (DT) with temporal features and the CNN. The experiments have been conducted by using the standard images that are collected from database and the current health data which are collected from patient through IoT devices. The results proved that the performance of the proposed prediction model which is able to achieve the better accuracy when it is compared with other existing prediction model.","[Palani, D.] Univ Coll Engn Villupuram, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Villupuram 605103, Tamil Nadu, India; [Venkatalakshmi, K.] Univ Coll Engn Tindivanam, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Tindivanam 604001, Tamil Nadu, India","Palani, D (corresponding author), Univ Coll Engn Villupuram, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Villupuram 605103, Tamil Nadu, India.",dpalani.phd2018@gmail.com; venkata_krish@yahoo.com,,,,,"Aerts HJWL, 2014, NAT COMMUN, V5, DOI 10.1038/ncomms500; Bai PR, 2013, COMPUT BIOL MED, V43, P1827, DOI 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.08.02; Biswas S, 2016, OPTIK, V127, P8916, DOI 10.1016/j.ijleo.2016.06.11; Cai WL, 2007, PATTERN RECOGN, V40, P825, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2006.07.01; Chen YT, 2017, MAGN RESON IMAGING, V39, P175, DOI 10.1016/j.mri.2017.02.00; De S, 2016, APPL SOFT COMPUT, V47, P669, DOI 10.1016/j.asoc.2016.05.04; Drozdzal M, 2018, MED IMAGE ANAL, V44, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.media.2017.11.00; Farag AA, 2013, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V22, P5202, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2013.228289; FUKUSHIMA K, 1980, BIOL CYBERN, V36, P193, DOI 10.1007/BF0034425; Ghosh P, 2016, NEUROCOMPUTING, V195, P181, DOI 10.1016/j.neucom.2015.09.12; Gope P, 2016, IEEE SENS J, V16, P1368, DOI 10.1109/JSEN.2015.250240; Jebadurai J, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V83, P338, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.01.05; Kallel IK, 2018, PATTERN RECOGN, V78, P182, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2018.01.02; Kalshetti P, 2017, COMPUT BIOL MED, V83, P22, DOI 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.02.00; Kannan SR, 2010, J SYST SOFTWARE, V83, P2487, DOI 10.1016/j.jss.2010.07.03; Kubota T, 2011, MED IMAGE ANAL, V15, P133, DOI 10.1016/j.media.2010.08.00; Lassen BC, 2015, PHYS MED BIOL, V60, P1307, DOI 10.1088/0031-9155/60/3/130; Li BN, 2011, COMPUT BIOL MED, V41, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2010.10.00; Li YY, 2015, INFORM SCIENCES, V294, P408, DOI 10.1016/j.ins.2014.10.00; Liu C, 2018, PATTERN RECOGN, V76, P367, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2017.11.01; Mahapatra D, 2016, COMPUT VIS IMAGE UND, V151, P114, DOI 10.1016/j.cviu.2016.01.00; Manikandan S, 2014, MEASUREMENT, V47, P558, DOI 10.1016/j.measurement.2013.09.03; Miao JQ, 2018, INFORM SCIENCES, V447, P52, DOI 10.1016/j.ins.2018.02.00; Nerkar R., 2017, J MOD TRENDS SCI TEC, V3, P10; OTSU N, 1979, IEEE T SYST MAN CYB, V9, P62, DOI 10.1109/TSMC.1979.431007; Parida P, 2016, ENG SCI TECHNOL, V19, P1206, DOI 10.1016/j.jestch.2015.12.00; Rangaswamy C, 2017, INT J PURE APPL MATH, V117, P45; Sharma N, 2010, J MED PHYS, V35, P3, DOI 10.4103/0971-6203.5877; Siegel RL, 2016, CA-CANCER J CLIN, V66, P7, DOI 10.3322/caac.2133; Singh C, 2018, APPL SOFT COMPUT, V68, P447, DOI 10.1016/j.asoc.2018.03.05; Sun SH, 2012, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V31, P449, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2011.217135; Taher F, 2011, 2011 IEEE GCC Conference and Exhibition (GCC), P295, DOI 10.1109/IEEEGCC.2011.575253; Torbati N, 2014, COMPUT BIOL MED, V44, P76, DOI 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.10.02; Vardhana M, 2018, COGN SYST RES, V50, P10, DOI 10.1016/j.cogsys.2018.03.00; Yang SC, 2017, COMPUT ELECTR ENG, V62, P151, DOI 10.1016/j.compeleceng.2016.12.02; Zhang XL, 2015, OPTIK, V126, P2398, DOI 10.1016/j.ijleo.2015.06.01; Zhao WC, 2018, OPTIK, V158, P1160, DOI 10.1016/j.ijleo.2018.01.00; Zheng Q, 2018, J VIS COMMUN IMAGE R, V55, P157, DOI 10.1016/j.jvcir.2018.06.00; Zhou SP, 2017, NEUROCOMPUTING, V234, P216, DOI 10.1016/j.neucom.2017.01.01",39,16,16,2,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Here, different types of non-linear filters and different edge detection techniques are used to segment the edges and the results are compared. The result shows that median filter obtains improved segmented output results in terms of edge length density, average magnitude, final threshold, initial position, and fine-tuned image. The behaviour of spine FEA model is analysed in terms of various parameters like equivalent elastic strain, total deformation, maximum principal elastic strain, minimum principal elastic strain, shear elastic strain, normal elastic strain, and minimum and maximum principal stress, equivalent stress, shear stress and normal stress. These parameters are used to analyse the human spine model under different conditions and different angles using ANSYS simulation tool. Further, MATLAB is carried out to implement various filters and edge detectors on proposed spine model.","[Punarselvam, E.] Muthayammal Engn Coll, Dept Informat Technol, Rasipuram, India; [Suresh, P.] Muthayammal Engn Coll, Dept Mech Engn, Rasipuram, India","Punarselvam, E (corresponding author), Muthayammal Engn Coll, Dept Informat Technol, Rasipuram, India.",punarselvam83@gmail.com,"P, Suresh/D-2981-2014; Suresh/AAT-2709-2021","P, Suresh/0000-0002-0488-972X; Suresh/0000-0003-3991-6991",,,"Alomari RS, 2011, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V30, P1, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2010.204740; Basha AA, 2018, HEALTH INF SCI SYST, V6, DOI 10.1007/s13755-018-0055-; Biswas S, 2018, OPTIK, V168, P931, DOI 10.1016/j.ijleo.2018.05.01; Corso JJ, 2008, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V5241, P202, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-85988-8_2; Eom J, 2010, MED PHYS, V37, P4389, DOI 10.1118/1.345527; Ghosh S, 2011, PROC SPIE, V7963, DOI 10.1117/12.87805; Goel VK, 2016, SPINE, V41, pA6, DOI 10.1097/BRS.000000000000142; Gustafson HM, 2017, J MECH BEHAV BIOMED, V65, P801, DOI 10.1016/j.jmbbm.2016.10.00; Hsu C-H, 2018, J AMB INTEL HUM COMP, P1, DOI 10.1109/SC2.2018.0002; Hua ZY, 2017, INFORM SCIENCES, V396, P97, DOI 10.1016/j.ins.2017.02.03; Huang SH, 2009, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V28, P1595, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2009.202336; Kumar PM, 2018, COMPUT NETW, V144, P154, DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2018.07.00; Kumar PM, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V86, P527, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.04.03; Lokesh S., 2018, NEURAL COMPUT APPL, V2018, P; Lujan AE, 2003, MED PHYS, V30, P2643, DOI 10.1118/1.160905; Manogaran G., 2018, IEEE ACCES; Mastmeyer A, 2006, MED IMAGE ANAL, V10, P560, DOI 10.1016/j.media.2006.05.00; Mathan K, 2018, DES AUTOM EMBED SYST, P; Michopoulou SK, 2009, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V56, P2225, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2009.201976; Parthasarathy P., 2018, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, V360, DOI 10.1088/1757-899X/360/1/01205; Parthasarathy Panchatchram, 2018, World Review of Science, Technology and Sustainable Development, V14, P5; Parthasarathy P, 2018, HEALTH INF SCI SYST, V6, DOI 10.1007/s13755-018-0043-; Parthasarathy P., 2018, INFORM MED UNLOCKE; Parthasarathy P., 2018, INT J COMPUT APPL, V42, P; Parthasarathy P, 2018, HEALTH INF SCI SYST, V6, DOI 10.1007/s13755-018-0058-; Priya S, 2018, PERS UBIQUIT COMPUT, P; Roberts MC, 2009, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V5762, P101; Schoenfeld AJ, 2010, J TRAUMA, V68, P109, DOI 10.1097/TA.0b013e3181c0b67; Smyth PP, 1997, IMAGE VISION COMPUT, V15, P575, DOI 10.1016/S0262-8856(97)00006-; Stern D, 2010, PHYS MED BIOL, V55, P247, DOI 10.1088/0031-9155/55/1/01; Sundarasekar R, 2018, J MED SYST, V42, DOI 10.1007/s10916-018-1093-; Varatharajan R, 2018, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, P; Vijayakumar V., 2018, MOBILE NETW APPL, P; Wang GH, 2018, OPTIK, V173, P157, DOI 10.1016/j.ijleo.2018.08.01; Wang ZJ, 2015, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V34, P1640, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2014.236574; Zhan YQ, 2012, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V7510, P141, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-33415-3_1",36,5,5,1,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The proposed algorithm uses the number of non noisy pixels in the current processing vicinity as values in the decision tree. Tri-state values such as unsymmetrical truncated median or modified Winsorized mean or midpoint replaces the corrupted pixel based on the decision tree in the current processing kernel. The algorithm exhibits good PSNR, IEF, low MSE and High structural preservation property even after removing high density noise. The performance of the proposed algorithm was also found good visually. The Key aspect of the work is the combination of tree based decision and tri-state non linear values which preserves the information content of images that are required for further processing.","[Ramachandran, Varatharajan] Sri Ramanujar Engn Coll, Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu, India; [Kishorebabu, Vasanth] Vidya Jyothi Inst Technol, Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu, India","Ramachandran, V (corresponding author), Sri Ramanujar Engn Coll, Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu, India.",varathu21@yahoo.com,"K, vasanth/A-4310-2017","K, vasanth/0000-0002-6886-5727",,,"Abdel M., 2018, FUTURE GENERATION C; Abdel-Basset M., 2018, DESIGN AUTOMATION EM, P; Abdel-Basset M, 2019, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V90, P489, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.08.03; Abdel-Basset M, 2019, CONCURR COMP-PRACT E, V31, DOI 10.1002/cpe.451; Abdel-Basset M, 2020, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V79, P5419, DOI 10.1007/s11042-018-6266-; Abdel-Basset M, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V85, P129, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.03.02; Bai T, 2014, SIGNAL PROCESS, V102, P247, DOI 10.1016/j.sigpro.2014.03.02; Balasubramanian S, 2009, PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL, AUTOMATION, COMMUNICATION AND ENERGY CONSERVATION INCACEC 2009 VOL 1, P9; BROWNRIGG DRK, 1984, COMMUN ACM, V27, P807, DOI 10.1145/358198.35822; Chen T, 1999, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V8, P1834, DOI 10.1109/83.80663; Esakkirajan S, 2011, IEEE SIGNAL PROC LET, V18, P287, DOI 10.1109/LSP.2011.212233; Hussein ZR, 2009, INT J COMPUT SCI NET, V9, P13; HWANG H, 1995, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V4, P499, DOI 10.1109/83.37067; Jayasree PS, 2013, SIGNAL IMAGE VIDEO P, V7, P1145, DOI 10.1007/s11760-012-0368-; KO SJ, 1991, IEEE T CIRCUITS SYST, V38, P984, DOI 10.1109/31.8387; Kumar PM, 2020, J SUPERCOMPUT, V76, P3963, DOI 10.1007/s11227-017-2169-; Kumar PM, 2018, COMPUT NETW, V144, P154, DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2018.07.00; Kumar PM, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V86, P527, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.04.03; Kumar PM, 2019, CLUSTER COMPUT, V22, pS7733, DOI 10.1007/s10586-017-1323-; LAI SM, 1989, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V8, P377, DOI 10.1109/42.4149; Manogaran G, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V82, P375, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2017.10.04; Meenakshi Sundaram K., 2014, INT J INNOVATIVE RES, V; Nair MS, 2008, CISP 2008: FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOL 1, PROCEEDINGS, P426, DOI 10.1109/CISP.2008.2; Priyan M.

High or low blood pressure or its rapid fluctuations can be associated to various diseases or conditions. Nowadays, high blood pressure is considered to be an important health risk factor and major cause of various health problems worldwide. High blood pressure may precede serious heart diseases, stroke and kidney failure. Accurate blood pressure measurement and monitoring plays fundamental role in diagnosis, prevention and treatment of these diseases. Blood pressure is usually measured in the hospitals, as a part of a standard medical routine. However, there is an increasing demand for methodologies, systems as well as accurate and unobtrusive devices that will permit continuous blood pressure measurement and monitoring for a wide variety of patients, allowing them to perform their daily activities without any disturbance. Technological advancements in the last decade have created opportunities for using various devices as a part of ambient assisted living for improving quality of life for people in their natural environment. The main goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of various methodologies for continuous cuff-less blood pressure measurement, as well as to evidence recently developed devices and systems for continuous blood pressure measurement that can be used in ambient assisted living applications.","[Stojanova, Aleksandra; Koceski, Saso; Koceska, Natasa] Univ Goce Delcev Stip, Fac Comp Sci, Stip, North Macedonia","Stojanova, A (corresponding author), Univ Goce Delcev Stip, Fac Comp Sci, Stip, North Macedonia.",aleksandra.stojanova@ugd.edu.mk; saso.koceski@ugd.edu.mk; natasa.koceska@ugd.edu.mk,,"Koceski, Saso/0000-0002-5513-1898; Stojanova, Aleksandra/0000-0003-0381-9962",,,"Ahmad S, 2012, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V59, P608, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2011.218001; Al-Shaqi R, 2016, SPRINGERPLUS, V5, DOI 10.1186/s40064-016-2272-; AlMahamdy M, 2014, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V37, P325, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2014.08.04; Ananth S., 2014, PROJECT MILESTONE R; [Anonymous], [No title captured; Arza A, 2013, COMPUT CARDIOL CONF, V40, P88; Baek HJ, 2009, TELEMED J E-HEALTH, V15, P182, DOI 10.1089/tmj.2008.009; Bagha S., 2011, INT J COMPUT APPL, V36, P45, DOI [10.5120/4537-6461, DOI 10.5120/4537-6461; Buxi D, 2015, PHYSIOL MEAS, V36, pR1, DOI 10.1088/0967-3334/36/3/R; Cattivelli FS, 2009, SIXTH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON WEARABLE AND IMPLANTABLE BODY SENSOR NETWORKS, PROCEEDINGS, P114, DOI [10.1109/BSN.2009.35, 10.1109/P3644.34; Chandrasekaran V, 2013, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V60, P1080, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2012.221107; Chandrasekhar A, 2018, SCI TRANSL MED, V10, DOI 10.1126/scitranslmed.aap867; Chen Y, 2012, ANN BIOMED ENG, V40, P871, DOI 10.1007/s10439-011-0467-; Chen Y, 2009, ANN BIOMED ENG, V37, P2222, DOI 10.1007/s10439-009-9759-; Chung E, 2013, FRONT MED-PRC, V7, P91, DOI 10.1007/s11684-013-0239-; Diab M.

Data mining (DM) offers a set of powerful techniques that allow the identification and extraction of relevant information from medical datasets, thus enabling doctors and patients to greatly benefit from DM, particularly in the case of diseases with high mortality and morbidity rates, such as heart disease (HD). Nonetheless, the use of raw medical data implies several challenges, such as missing data, noise, redundancy and high dimensionality, which make the extraction of useful and relevant information difficult and challenging. Intensive research has, therefore, recently begun in order to prepare raw healthcare data before knowledge extraction. In any knowledge data discovery (KDD) process, data preparation is the step prior to DM that deals with data imperfectness in order to improve its quality so as to satisfy the requirements and improve the performances of DM techniques. The objective of this paper is to perform a systematic mapping study (SMS) on data preparation for KDD in cardiology so as to provide an overview of the quantity and type of research carried out in this respect. The SMS consisted of a set of 58 selected papers published in the period January 2000 and December 2017. The selected studies were analyzed according to six criteria: year and channel of publication, preparation task, medical task, DM objective, research type and empirical type. The results show that a high amount of data preparation research was carried out in order to improve the performance of DM-based decision support systems in cardiology. Researchers were mainly interested in the data reduction preparation task and particularly in feature selection. Moreover, the majority of the selected studies focused on classification for the diagnosis of HD. Two main research types were identified in the selected studies: solution proposal and evaluation research, and the most frequently used empirical type was that of historical-based evaluation.","[Benhar, H.; Idri, A.] Univ Mohammed V Rabat, ENSIAS, Software Project Management Res Team, BP 713, Rabat, Morocco; [Fernandez-Aleman, J.

Privacy protection and the secure storage of medical data are crucial issues during medical services. Secure storage and making full use of personal medical records has always been a concern for the general population. The emergence of blockchain technology brings a new idea to solve this problem. As a hash chain with the characteristics of decentralization, verifiability and immutability, blockchain technology can be used to securely store personal medical data. In this paper, we design a storage scheme to manage personal medical data based on blockchain and cloud storage. Furthermore, a service framework for sharing medical records is described. In addition, the characteristics of the medical blockchain are presented and analyzed through a comparison with traditional systems. The proposed storage and sharing scheme does not depend on any third-party and no single party has absolute power to affect the processing.","[Chen, Yi; Ding, Shuai; Zheng, Handong; Yang, Shanlin] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Management, Hefei 23009, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yi; Ding, Shuai; Zheng, Handong; Yang, Shanlin] Hefei Univ Technol, Key Lab Proc Optimizat & Intelligent Decis Making, Minist Educ, Hefei 23009, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zheng] Minist Publ Secur, Res Inst 3, Shanghai 201142, Peoples R China","Ding, S (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Management, Hefei 23009, Anhui, Peoples R China.;Ding, S (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Key Lab Proc Optimizat & Intelligent Decis Making, Minist Educ, Hefei 23009, Anhui, Peoples R China.;Xu, Z (corresponding author), Minist Publ Secur, Res Inst 3, Shanghai 201142, Peoples R China.",chenyihfut@163.com; dingshuai@hfut.edu.cn; juven_xz@163.com; zhdhfut@163.com; yangsl@hfut.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71571058, 71690235]; Anhui Provincial Science and Technology Major Project [16030801121, 17030801001]; CCF-Venustech Open Research Fund [CCF-VenustechRP2017006]","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71571058 and 71690235), Anhui Provincial Science and Technology Major Project (Grant No. 16030801121 and 17030801001), CCF-Venustech Open Research Fund (Grant No. CCF-VenustechRP2017006).","Al Hamid HA, 2017, IEEE ACCESS, V5, P22313, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.275784; Alshagathrh F, 2018, INT J MED INFORM, V118, P113, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2018.08.00; [Anonymous], 2016, BLOCKCHAIN BASED AP; [Anonymous], [No title captured; Apple Inc, 2018, IOS HLT; Azaria A, 2016, PROCEEDINGS 2016 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON OPEN AND BIG DATA - OBD 2016, P25, DOI 10.1109/OBD.2016.1; Bahga A, 2013, IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH, V17, P894, DOI 10.1109/JBHI.2013.225781; Bhargava HK, 2014, MANAGE SCI, V60, P2543, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.2014.193; Chen TT, 2012, J MED SYST, V36, P291, DOI 10.1007/s10916-010-9475-; Chu CK, 2014, IEEE T PARALL DISTR, V25, P468, DOI 10.1109/TPDS.2013.11; Deloitte Consulting LLP, 2016, BLOCK OPP HLTH CA; Ding S, 2018, DECIS SUPPORT SYST, V107, P103, DOI 10.1016/j.dss.2017.12.01; Ding S, 2017, DECIS SUPPORT SYST, V93, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.dss.2016.09.00; Ekblaw A., 2016, CASE STUDY BLOCKCHA; Godinho TM, 2016, IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH, V20, P367, DOI 10.1109/JBHI.2014.236163; Goyal V., 2006, PROC 13 ACM C COMPUT, P8; Griggs KN, 2018, J MED SYST, V42, DOI 10.1007/s10916-018-0982-; He CG, 2013, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V60, P230, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2012.222240; He DB, 2018, IEEE T DEPEND SECURE, V15, P633, DOI 10.1109/TDSC.2016.259628; Huba N, 2012, J MED SYST, V36, P3893, DOI 10.1007/s10916-012-9861-; Hydari MZ, 2019, MANAGE SCI, V65, P2041, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.2018.304; Jabeen F, 2017, IEEE ACCESS, V5, P13308, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.270758; Kuo T, 2016, MODELCHAIN DECENTRA; Li C, 2018, APPL MATH COMPUT, V320, P512, DOI 10.1016/j.amc.2017.10.00; Li XB, 2017, INFORM SYST RES, V28, P332, DOI 10.1287/isre.2016.067; Lin C, 2018, J NETW COMPUT APPL, V116, P42, DOI 10.1016/j.jnca.2018.05.00; Lin C, 2018, IEEE ACCESS, V6, P28203, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2018.283765; LVAN D., 2016, MOVING BLOCKCHAIN B; Ma MM, 2018, COMPUT ELECTR ENG, V65, P413, DOI 10.1016/j.compeleceng.2017.05.01; Medibloc Team, 2017, MED WHI; Mettler M, 2016, 2016 IEEE 18TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON E-HEALTH NETWORKING, APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES (HEALTHCOM), P52; Peter B., 2017, BLOCKCHAIN APPL HEA; Prisco G, 2016, BLOCKCHAIN HEALTHCA; Simpao AF, 2014, J MED SYST, V38, DOI 10.1007/s10916-014-0045-; Singh K, 2017, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V72, P250, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2016.11.02; Solanas A, 2013, IEEE T INF FOREN SEC, V8, P901, DOI 10.1109/TIFS.2013.224872; U.

Various skin problems have similar symptoms. For example, in German measles (rubella), Chicken pox and Measles (rubella) a similarity can be observed in skin rashes and redness. The prognosis of skin problems take a long time as the patient's previous medical records, physical examination report and the respective laboratory diagnostic reports have to be studied. The recognition and diagnosis get tough due to the complexity involved. Subsequently, a computer aided analysis and recognition gadget would be handy in such cases. Computer algorithm steps include image processing, picture characteristic extraction and categorize facts with the help of a classifier with Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The ANN can analyze the patterns of symptoms of a particular disease and present faster prognosis and reputation than a human doctor. For this reason, the patients can undergo the treatment for the pores and skin problems based totally on the symptoms detected.","[Monisha, M.] Anna Univ, SA Engn Coll, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Suresh, A.] SA Engn Coll, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Rashmi, M.

In this paper, a Hybrid Multi-resolution filter for denoising the MRI images degraded by the Salt and Pepper noise is proposed and the wavelet transform is used to improve the resolution of the denoised image.. The Hybrid filter consist of three value weighted filter and similarity based filter. In three value weighted filter, a variable local window is applied to find the noisy pixels. By using the noise free pixels in that window, the noisy pixels are reconstructed using three value method. In similarity based filter, a variable local window is applied to reconstruct the noisy pixels. In that window, based on the similarity between the noisy pixel sequence and noise free pixels sequence are used to reconstruct the noisy pixel. At last wavelet transform is used to increase the resolution of the reconstructed image. The experimental results shows that the proposed filter denoises the image and improves the resolution when compared to the existing methods and produces the efficiency of about 98%.","[Murugan, K.] Tamilnadu Coll Engn, Dept ECE, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Arunachalam, V.

To make these communications secure, user authentication by medical servers is considered as a crucial requirement. For this purpose, many user authentication and key agreement protocols have been put forwrad in order to fulfil this vital necessity. Recently, Arshad and Rasoolzadegan have revealed that not only the authentication and key agreement protocols suggested by Amin and Biswas and Giri et al. are defenseless against the replay attack and do not support the perfect forward secrecy, but also Amin and Biswas's protocol is susceptible to the offline password guessing attack. Nonetheless, in this paper, we demonstrate that Arshad and Rasoolzadegan's and the other existing schemes still fail to resist a well-known attack. Therefore, to cover this security gap, a new user authentication and session key agreement protocol is recommended that can be employed effectively for offering secure communication channels in TMIS. Our comparative security and performance analyses reveal that the proposed scheme can both solve the existing security drawback and, same as Arshad and Rasoolzadegan's scheme, has low communication and computational overheads.","[Ostad-Sharif, Arezou; Abbasinezhad-Mood, Dariush; Nikooghadam, Morteza] Imam Reza Int Univ, Dept Comp Engn & Informat Technol, Mashhad, Iran","Nikooghadam, M (corresponding author), Imam Reza Int Univ, Dept Comp Engn & Informat Technol, Mashhad, Iran.",arezou.ostadsharif@imamreza.ac.ir; dariush.abbasinezhad@imamreza.ac.ir; m.nikooghadam@imamreza.ac,"Nikooghadam, Morteza/AAR-7984-2020; Abbasinezhad-Mood, Dariush/B-2199-2019; Ostad-Sharif, Arezou/X-2128-2019","Nikooghadam, Morteza/0000-0003-3894-3103; Abbasinezhad-Mood, Dariush/0000-0003-4943-1154; Ostad Sharif, Arezou/0000-0002-1649-0783",,,"Amin R, 2015, J MED SYST, V39, DOI 10.1007/s10916-015-0258-; Amin R, 2015, J MED SYST, V39, DOI 10.1007/s10916-015-0217-; Arshad H, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0585-; Arshad H, 2015, J MED SYST, V39, DOI 10.1007/s10916-015-0259-; Arshad H, 2014, J MED SYST, V38, DOI 10.1007/s10916-014-0136-; Awasthi AK, 2013, J MED SYST, V37, DOI 10.1007/s10916-013-9964-; Bin Muhaya FT, 2015, SECUR COMMUN NETW, V8, P149, DOI 10.1002/sec.96; Canetti R, 2001, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V2045, P45; Chaudhary R, 2018, IEEE COMMUN MAG, V56, P24, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2018.170078; Chaudhry SA, 2018, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V77, P5503, DOI 10.1007/s11042-017-4464-; Chaudhry SA, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0592-; Chaudhry SA, 2015, J MED SYST, V39, DOI 10.1007/s10916-015-0335-; Chaudhry SA, 2015, J MED SYST, V39, DOI 10.1007/s10916-015-0244-; Das A.

The identification of similar face with inter class similarity is very difficult in imaging. The imaging technology faces difficult in the mounting of intra class variability because of accommodate, intra-class variability because of head pose, illumination conditions, expressions, facial accessories, aging effects and cartoon faces. In the earliest approach, gradient with Zernike momemts were used to regonize the faces, the performance is low to overcome this a new approach is introduced. Many features of FR are affected by the outcome and low occurrence of performance is observed which is applicable only for data sets that are smaller. The introduction of a new approach can overcome the above stated limitations. This paper describes a novel approach for LS enhancement technique using GSNO and CWSNO, and extracts the PCA features with three ways such as mean, median and mode which are then classified with MD classifier using LOOCV of R-SM to recognize the faces. The performance metrics is also computed and compared. Performance metrics of the proposed approach and the current approach are computed and compared. Thus, the suggested method is useful for increasing the visibility of facial recognition, and overcoming a pose, similarity and illumination problem, which provides a more accurate investigation of the required recognition procedures.","[Rathika, N.; Suresh, P.; Sathya, N.] PSN Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, India","Rathika, N (corresponding author), PSN Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, India.",rathika.111287@gmail.com; suresh3982@gmail.com; sathyaeie@gmail.com,"P, Suresh/D-2981-2014","P, Suresh/0000-0002-0488-972X",,,"Abu-Mostafa Y.

Modern medicine associates this pathology with severe problems in the prenatal period. Underlying diseases of the mother during pregnancy, her anamnesis of life are the leading causes of complications in the newborn. Nevertheless, patterns of fetal hypoxia and neonatal hypoxia, as well as mechanisms of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in newborns, remains poorly known and require further research. This study is focused on finding risk factors related to the chronic fetal hypoxia and defining a group of signs for diagnosing neonatal hypoxia. The real data of 186 pregnant women at the gestation age from 12 to 38weeks were analyzed. A methodology for discovering interesting associations in gestation course data is proposed. Technique for association rules mining and rules selection by the neonatal hypoxia under study is discussed. The rules suggest that a strong relationship exists between the specific sets of attributes and the diagnosis. As a result, we set up a profile of the pregnant woman with a high likelihood of hypoxia of the newborn that would be beneficial to medical professionals.","[Skarga-Bandurova, Inna; Biloborodova, Tetiana; Nesterov, Maksym] Volodymyr Dahl East Ukrainian Natl Univ, Severodonetsk, Ukraine","Skarga-Bandurova, I (corresponding author), Volodymyr Dahl East Ukrainian Natl Univ, Severodonetsk, Ukraine.",skarga_bandurova@ukr.net; biloborodova@snu.edu.ua; m.nesterov@snu.edu.ua,"Skarga-Bandurova, Inna/C-2344-2016; Biloborodova, Tetiana/H-3332-2018","Skarga-Bandurova, Inna/0000-0003-3458-8730; Nesterov, Maksym/0000-0003-0333-2281; Biloborodova, Tetiana/0000-0001-7561-7484",,,"Agrawal R., 1993, SIGMOD Record, V22, P207, DOI 10.1145/170035.17007; Allen KA, 2011, NEWBORN INFANT NURS, V11, P125, DOI 10.1053/j.nainr.2011.07.00; Antonucci R, 2014, J PEDIATR NEONATAL I, V3, DOI 10.7363/03026; Billing VA, 2016, SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS S, V2, P14; Biloborodova T.

Our aim was to evaluate the effects of a mobile CT examination workflow on the radiographers' performance compared to conventional examinations. A prototype of a radiation protection cabin was installed besides the gantry of a CT system. The CT system was equipped with a simplified user interface on a portable tablet and a mobile remote control. 98 patients with an indication for CT of the chest were randomly assigned to examination using the mobile devices (study group, n=47) or using the conventional stationary workflow on the console (reference group, n=51). Three ceiling mounted fisheye cameras were used for motion tracking of the radiographers, two in the examination room and one in the control room. Relative density of detection heat-maps and area counts were assessed using a dedicated software tool to quantify radiographers' movements. Duration of each task of the examination was manually recorded using a stopwatch. In the reference group 25% of the area counts were located inside of the examination room, while it was 48% in the study group. The time spent in the same room with the patient increased from 3:06min (29%) to 6:01min (57%) using the mobile workflow (p<0.05), thereof 0:59min (9%) were spent in moderate separation with maintained voice and visual contact in the radiation protection cabin. Heat-maps showed an increase of the radiographer's working area, indicating a higher freedom of movement. Total duration of the examination was slightly less in the study group without statistical significance (median time: study 10:36, reference 10:50min; p=0.29). A mobile CT examination transfers the radiographers' interaction with the scanner from the control room into the examination room. There, radiographers' freedom of movement is higher, without any tradeoffs regarding the examination duration.","[Wetzl, Matthias; Heiss, Rafael; Schruefer, Eleni; Wuest, Wolfgang; Cavallaro, Alexander; Uder, Michael; May, Matthias Stefan] Univ Hosp Erlangen, Dept Radiol, Maximilianspl 3, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Weller, Melanie; Thierfelder, Carsten; Lerch, Daniel] Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Siemensstr 3, D-91301 Forchheim, Germany; [Cavallaro, Alexander; Amarteifio, Patrick; Uder, Michael; May, Matthias Stefan] Univ Hosp Erlangen, Imaging Sci Inst, Ulmenweg 18, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Amarteifio, Patrick] Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Henkestr 127, D-91052 Erlangen, Germany","May, MS (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Erlangen, Dept Radiol, Maximilianspl 3, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.;May, MS (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Erlangen, Imaging Sci Inst, Ulmenweg 18, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.",Matthias.May@uk-erlangen.de,"May, Matthias/AAZ-4877-2021","May, Matthias/0000-0002-2540-850X",,,"Boland Giles W L, 2008, J Am Coll Radiol, V5, P119, DOI 10.1016/j.jacr.2007.07.00; Boland GWL, 2008, AM J ROENTGENOL, V191, P3, DOI 10.2214/AJR.07.320; Faggioni L, 2011, EUR J RADIOL, V78, P210, DOI 10.1016/j.ejrad.2009.06.02; Hirata M, 2017, CARDIOVASC INTER RAD, V40, P609, DOI 10.1007/s00270-017-1605-; Jamwal R, 2018, JMIR RES PROTOC, V7, DOI 10.2196/1045; Kammerer FJ, 2014, J DIGIT IMAGING, V27, P557, DOI 10.1007/s10278-014-9691-; Lell MM, 2015, INVEST RADIOL, V50, P629, DOI 10.1097/RLI.000000000000017; Lin CT, 2001, ARCH INTERN MED, V161, P1437, DOI 10.1001/archinte.161.11.143; Mc Laughlin P, 2012, EMERG RADIOL, V19, P127, DOI 10.1007/s10140-011-1011-; Muller M, 2013, INT J COMPUT ASS RAD, V8, P663, DOI 10.1007/s11548-013-0828-; Nievelstein RAJ, 2010, PEDIATR RADIOL, V40, P1324, DOI 10.1007/s00247-010-1714-; Perrot A, 2015, SYMP LARG DATA ANAL, P99, DOI 10.1109/LDAV.2015.734807; Sanjeevkumar A, 2015, REV VIDEO SURVEILLAN, V4, P48; Schlechtweg PM, 2011, RADIOLOGE, V51, P392, DOI 10.1007/s00117-011-2169-; Schlechtweg PM, 2014, J DIGIT IMAGING, V27, P479, DOI 10.1007/s10278-014-9688-; Siegel E, 2002, AM J ROENTGENOL, V178, P563, DOI 10.2214/ajr.178.3.178056; Thukral Brij Bhushan, 2015, Indian J Radiol Imaging, V25, P359, DOI 10.4103/0971-3026.16946",17,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

However, the amount of error depending on this measurement methodology is unclear. To evaluate the intra- and inter-rater reliability to calculate HRV indices, comparing different times and by different trained examiners in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Thirty individuals of both genders, aged between 18 and 45years, with T2DM. The RR interval (RRi) were recorded during a 10min period on supine position using a portable heart rate monitor (Polar (R) S810i model). HRV indices were calculated by the software Kubios (R) HRV analysis (version 2.2). Linear (Mean RRi; STD RR; Mean HR; rMSSD; RR Tri; TINN LF; HF; total power) and non-linear (SD1; SD2; DF1; DF2, ApEn and, SampEn) indices were calculated by two examiners with an interval of one week between them. Substantial to excellent was found for reliability of the intra-examiner, with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values ranging from 0.79 to 0.99, standard error of measurement (SEM) between 0.02 and 123.49 (inpercentage: 1.83 and 16.67), and minimum detectable change (MDC) between 0.07 and 342.30. Regarding the inter-examiner reliability, substantial to excellent reliability was found, with ICC values ranging from 0.73 to 0.97, SEM between 0.04 and 178.13 (in percentage: 3.26 and 24.18), and MDC between 0.11 and 493.77. The use of the portable heart rate monitor to measure HRV showed acceptable intra and inter reliability in individuals with T2DM, supporting the use of this method of evaluation in research and clinical practice.","[Bassi, Daniela] Ceuma Univ, Postgrad Program Management & Hlth Serv, Sao Luis, MA, Brazil; [Bassi, Daniela] Univ Ceuma, Dept Fisioterapia, Rua Josue Montello,1,Jardim Renascenca, BR-65075120 Sao Luis, MA, Brazil; [Santos-de-Araujo, Aldair Darlan] Tiradentes Univ Ctr, Dept Phys Therapy, Maceio, AL, Brazil; [Camargo, Patricia Faria; Mendes, Renata Goncalves; Borghi-Silva, Audrey] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Phys Therapy, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Dibai-Filho, Almir Vieira] Univ Fed Maranhao, Dept Phys Educ, Sao Luis, MA, Brazil; [da Fonseca, Moyrane Abreu] Ceuma Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, Sao Luis, MA, Brazil","Bassi, D (corresponding author), Ceuma Univ, Postgrad Program Management & Hlth Serv, Sao Luis, MA, Brazil.;Bassi, D (corresponding author), Univ Ceuma, Dept Fisioterapia, Rua Josue Montello,1,Jardim Renascenca, BR-65075120 Sao Luis, MA, Brazil.",danielabassifisio@gmail.com,"Santos-de-Araújo, Aldair Darlan/T-2197-2019; Borghi-Silva, Audrey/F-5702-2012; Camargo, Patrícia/AAD-7555-2022; Mendes, Renata Gonçalves/E-9284-2013; Filho, Almir Vieira Dibai/B-3871-2013; Dibai, Daniela Bassi/R-8816-2016","Santos-de-Araújo, Aldair Darlan/0000-0001-6436-9059; Camargo, Patrícia/0000-0002-6564-1672; Mendes, Renata Gonçalves/0000-0003-4683-2657; Filho, Almir Vieira Dibai/0000-0001-5403-8248; Dibai, Daniela Bassi/0000-0002-6140-0177; Abreu da Fonseca, Moyrane/0000-0003-0074-8206",National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq); Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) [2009/01842-0],"Supported by a National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq) and Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, grant number 2009/01842-0).","Bassi D, 2018, ARQ BRAS CARDIOL, V111, P64, DOI 10.5935/abc.2018010; Bassi D, 2015, REV BRAS MED ESPORTE, V21, P313, DOI 10.1590/1517-86922015210415000; Bonett DG, 2002, STAT MED, V21, P1331, DOI 10.1002/sim.110; Bray GA, 2013, DIABETES CARE, V36, P11, DOI 10.2337/dc12-163; Camm AJ, 1996, CIRCULATION, V93, P104; Costa ACS, 2013, REV BRAS FISIOTER, V17, P24, DOI 10.1590/S1413-3555201200500005; Barbosa MPDD, 2016, CLIN PHYSIOL FUNCT I, V36, P112, DOI 10.1111/cpf.1220; Dantas EM, 2012, COMPUT BIOL MED, V42, P164, DOI 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2011.11.00; Dibai AV, 2015, BRAZ J PHYS THER, V19, P122, DOI 10.1590/bjpt-rbf.2014.007; Ferreira Maycon Jr, 2016, Motriz: rev. educ. fis., V22, P3, DOI 10.1590/S1980-6574201600020000; Fleiss J., 1986, RELIABILITY MEASUREM, P1, DOI [10.1002/9781118032923, DOI 10.1002/9781118032923; Furlan L, 2018, FRONT HUM NEUROSCI, V12, DOI 10.3389/fnhum.2018.0009; Giles D, 2016, EUR J APPL PHYSIOL, V116, P563, DOI 10.1007/s00421-015-3303-; Gisselman A.

Medicine is one of the most suitable application domains for these techniques since they help model diagnostic information based on causal and/or statistical data and therefore reveal hidden dependencies between symptoms and illnesses. In this paper we give a detailed overview of the recent machine learning research and its applications for predicting cognitive diseases, especially the Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and the Parkinson's disease. We survey different state-of-the-art methodological approaches, data sources and public data, and provide their comparative analysis. We conclude by identifying the open problems within the field that include an early detection of the cognitive diseases and inclusion of machine learning tools into diagnostic practice and therapy planning.","[Bratic, Brankica; Kurbalija, Vladimir; Ivanovic, Mirjana] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 4, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Oder, Iztok; Bosnic, Zoran] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Comp & Informat Sci, Vecna Pot 113, Ljubljana, Slovenia","Bratic, B (corresponding author), Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 4, Novi Sad, Serbia.",brankica.bratic@dmi.uns.ac.rs; kurba@dmi.uns.ac.rs; mira@dmi.uns.ac.rs; iztok.oder@gmail.com; zoran.bosnic@fri.uni-lj.si,"Ivanovic, M./AAE-7711-2020","Bratic, Brankica/0000-0002-6388-2704; Ivanovic, Mirjana/0000-0003-1946-0384; Kurbalija, Vladimir/0000-0002-9599-4495","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [BI-RS/16-17-047, OI174023]; Slovenian Research Agency [BI-RS/16-17-047]","This work is supported by the bilateral project between Slovenia and Serbia: BI-RS/16-17-047, Intelligent computer techniques for improving medical detection, analysis and explanation of human cognition and behavior disorders between the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia and the Slovenian Research Agency.

It is used to investigate some types of abnormal heart function including arrhythmias and conduction disturbance. In this paper the proposed method is used to classify the ECG signal by using classification technique. First the Input signal is preprocessed by using filtering method such as low pass, high pass and butter worth filter to remove the high frequency noise. Butter worth filter is to remove the excess noise in the signal. After preprocessing peak points are detected by using peak detection algorithm and extract the features for the signal are extracted using statistical parameters. Finally, extracted features are classified by using SVM, Adaboost, ANN and Naive Bayes classifier to classify the ECG signal database into normal or abnormal ECG signal. Experimental result shows that the accuracy of the SVM, Adaboost, ANN and Naive Bayes classifier is 87.5%, 93%, 94 and 99.7%. Compared to other classifier naive bayes classifier accuracy is high.","[Celin, S.] Sathyabama Inst Sci & Technol, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Vasanth, K.] Vidya Jyothi Inst Technol, Hyderabad 500075, Telangana, India","Celin, S (corresponding author), Sathyabama Inst Sci & Technol, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.",celin10sam@gmail.com; vasanthecek@gmail.com,"Beneth, Celin/AAI-9953-2021; K, vasanth/A-4310-2017","K, vasanth/0000-0002-6886-5727",,,"Ahilan A, 2016, INFORM MIDEM, V46, P25; Ahilan A, 2015, MICROELECTRON RELIAB, V55, P2108, DOI 10.1016/j.microrel.2015.06.07; Ahilan A., 2015, ADV INTELLIGENT SYST, P23; Ahilan A, 2015, MALAYSIA, V6, P5; Arias-Castro E, 2009, ANN STAT, V37, P1172, DOI 10.1214/08-AOS60; Daskalov IK, 1999, MED ENG PHYS, V21, P37, DOI 10.1016/S1350-4533(99)00016-; El-Khafif S.H., 2013, ISRN BIOMEDICAL ENG, V2013, DOI 10.1155/2013/26191; Emanet N, 2009, INT C SOFT COMP SOF; Engin M, 2004, PATTERN RECOGN LETT, V25, P1715, DOI 10.1016/j.patrec.2004.06.01; Gaikwad KM, 2014, IEEE GLOB CONF WIREL, P121, DOI 10.1109/GCWCN.2014.703086; Golrizkhatami Z., 2018, INT J APPL ARTIFICI; Guler I, 2005, PATTERN RECOGN, V38, P199, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2004.06.00; Harikumar R., 2011, INT J SOFT COMPUTING, V; Jaykumar S.Karnewar, 2013, INT J COMPUTER APP; Jiang W, 2005, IEEE IJCNN, P32; Jiang W, 2007, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V18, P1750, DOI 10.1109/TNN.2007.90023; Kaistha T., 2016, INT J COMPUT TECHNOL, V9, P17; Kedir-Talha Malika-Djahida, 2012, 2012 11th International Conference on Information Sciences, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA), P830, DOI 10.1109/ISSPA.2012.631066; Kropf M, 2017, COMPUT CARDIOL CONF, V44, DOI 10.22489/CinC.2017.168-16; Li TY, 2016, ENTROPY-SWITZ, V18, DOI 10.3390/e1808028; Lyons R, 2003, IEEE SIGNAL PROC MAG, V20, P50, DOI 10.1109/MSP.2003.116662; Maciejewski M, 2017, SIG P ALGO ARCH ARR, P243, DOI 10.23919/SPA.2017.816687; Mahapatra S, 2001, MEASUREMENT, V30, P231, DOI 10.1016/S0263-2241(01)00007-; Mahapatra S, 2016, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V92, P175, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2016.07.34; Nayak Seema, 2012, INT J RES ENG APPL S, V; Padmavathi S., 2015, Procedia Computer Science, V47, P222, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2015.03.20; Rajesh KNVPS, 2018, BIOMED SIGNAL PROCES, V41, P242, DOI 10.1016/j.bspc.2017.12.00; SARAMAKI T, 1988, IEEE T CIRCUITS SYST, V35, P70, DOI 10.1109/31.170; Sarma P, 2013, 2013 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EMERGING TRENDS AND APPLICATIONS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (ICETACS), P187, DOI 10.1109/ICETACS.2013.669142; Subbiah S, 2015, INT C INT RES ENG TE, P5; Tayel MB, 2018, J ELECTROCARDIOL, V51, P265, DOI 10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2017.10.00; Upganlawar I.V., 2014, INT J EMERG TRENDS T, V11, P166, DOI [10.14445/22312803/IJCTT-V11P135, DOI 10.14445/22312803/IJCTT-V11P135; Xiong Z., 2017, CARDIOLOGY, P4; Yie-Chien Chen, 1998, Fuzzy logic and expert systems applications, P28; Zhao QB, 2005, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2005 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND BRAIN, VOLS 1-3, P108",35,27,28,1,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The method assumes that anesthesia staffing is planned based on the workload and not vice-versa. We used the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) meeting to test the assumption across a large population. The observational study cohort was all 3,191,282 major therapeutic procedures performed during 2,517,842 cases at all 121 non-federal hospitals in the State of Iowa, 2007-16. The Fridays to Wednesdays of the annual ASA meetings were compared pairwise by year with those days of the other (mean=43.0 [SE =0.3]) weeks without a federal holiday. Differences in counts of procedures (P=0.45, 0.5% [0.7%]) and cases performed (P=0.93, 0.1% [1.0%]) were not significant. In contrast, compared to non-meeting weeks, during the American College of Surgeons meeting, there were fewer general surgery procedures performed (P=0.0009, -9.1% [1.9%]), fewer procedures performed of any type (P=0.022, -2.1% [0.8]), and fewer cases of any type (P=0.003, -2.5% [0.6%]). Similarly, during the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons meeting, there were fewer joint arthroplasties performed (P<0.0001, -27.1% [3.1%]), fewer procedures (P=0.011, -6.3% [2.0%]), and fewer cases (P=0.018, -5.9% [2.0%]). The results show that, in routine practice, anesthesia staffing and staff scheduling are being chosen to prevent the meeting from affecting patients' and surgeons' access to OR time.","[Dexter, Franklin] Univ Iowa, Dept Anesthesia, 200 Hawkins Dr,6 JCP, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Epstein, Richard H.] Univ Miami, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat Med & Pain Management, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA","Dexter, F (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Dept Anesthesia, 200 Hawkins Dr,6 JCP, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",Franklin-Dexter@UIowa.edu; repstein@med.miami.edu,"Dexter, Franklin/V-1495-2019; Epstein, Richard/AHD-1384-2022","Dexter, Franklin/0000-0001-5897-2484; ",,,"Abouleish AE, 2002, ANESTHESIOLOGY, V97, P608, DOI 10.1097/00000542-200209000-0001; Batun S, 2011, INFORMS J COMPUT, V23, P220, DOI 10.1287/ijoc.1100.039; Dexter F, 2000, AANA J, V68, P2; Dexter F, 2001, AORN J, V74, P664, DOI 10.1016/S0001-2092(06)61765-; Dexter F, 2000, ANESTH ANALG, V90, P98; Dexter F, 2005, ANESTH ANALG, V100, P1425, DOI 10.1213/01.ANE.0000149898.45044.3; Dexter F, 1999, ANESTH ANALG, V89, P7, DOI 10.1097/00000539-199907000-0000; Dexter F, 2002, ANESTH ANALG, V94, P1272, DOI 10.1097/00000539-200205000-0004; Dexter Franklin, 2006, Health Care Manag Sci, V9, P325, DOI 10.1007/s10729-006-9997-; Dexter F, 2006, ANESTH ANALG, V103, P1494, DOI 10.1213/01.ane.0000237176.10774.1; Dexter F, 2018, J CLIN ANESTH, V49, P118, DOI 10.1016/j.jclinane.2018.04.00; Dexter F, 2018, J CLIN ANESTH, V44, P107, DOI 10.1016/j.jclinane.2017.11.00; Dexter F, 2017, J CLIN ANESTH, V42, P88, DOI 10.1016/j.jclinane.2017.08.01; Dexter Franklin, 2003, AORN J, V77, P825, DOI 10.1016/S0001-2092(06)60801-; Dexter F, 2016, ANESTH ANALG, V122, P831, DOI 10.1213/ANE.000000000000113; Dexter F, 2015, ANESTH ANALG, V121, P1600, DOI 10.1213/ANE.000000000000077; Dexter F, 2012, ANESTH ANALG, V115, P1188, DOI 10.1213/ANE.0b013e31826a5f9; Dexter F, 2012, CAN J ANESTH, V59, P571, DOI 10.1007/s12630-012-9693-; Dexter F, 2009, ANESTH ANALG, V109, P1246, DOI 10.1213/ane.0b013e3181b0ffc; Epstein RH, 2002, ANESTH ANALG, V94, P640, DOI 10.1097/00000539-200203000-0002; Gallivan S, 2002, BRIT MED J, V324, P280, DOI 10.1136/bmj.324.7332.28; He B, 2012, M&SOM-MANUF SERV OP, V14, P99, DOI 10.1287/msom.1110.035; Hosseini N, 2015, HEALTH CARE MANAG SC, V18, P419, DOI 10.1007/s10729-014-9269-; Iowa Hospital Association, REQ DA; Logvinov II, 2018, ANESTH ANALG, V126, P1249, DOI 10.1213/ANE.000000000000227; Lucas CE, 1997, J TRAUMA, V42, P818, DOI 10.1097/00005373-199705000-0001; Marcon E, 2007, ANESTH ANALG, V105, P119, DOI 10.1213/01.ane.0000266495.79050.b; Masursky D, 2008, ANESTH ANALG, V106, P1223, DOI 10.1213/ane.0b013e318167906; Masursky D, 2008, ANESTH ANALG, V107, P1989, DOI 10.1213/ane.0b013e31818874a; McIntosh C, 2006, ANESTH ANALG, V103, P1499, DOI 10.1213/01.ane.0000244535.54710.2; Moazzez A, 2016, AM SURGEON, V82, P89; Mueller RN, 2015, A A CASE REP, V5, P162, DOI 10.1213/XAA.000000000000016; Pandit JJ, 2009, ANESTH ANALG, V108, P1910, DOI 10.1213/ane.0b013e31819fe7a; Shi PY, 2016, ANESTH ANALG, V122, P526, DOI 10.1213/ANE.000000000000107; Stepaniak PS, 2009, ANESTH ANALG, V109, P1232, DOI 10.1213/ANE.0b013e3181b5de0; Strum D P, 1997, J Med Syst, V21, P309, DOI 10.1023/A:102282472569; Tanaka M, 2013, J EVAL CLIN PRACT, V19, P335, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2753.2012.01829.; Tessler MJ, 1997, CAN J ANAESTH, V44, P1036, DOI 10.1007/BF0301922; Tucker JB, 1999, J TRAUMA, V46, P71, DOI 10.1097/00005373-199901000-0001; van Oostrum JM, 2008, ANESTH ANALG, V107, P1655, DOI 10.1213/ane.0b013e318184e91; Yang M, 2013, CRIT CARE MED, V41, P414, DOI 10.1097/CCM.0b013e31826a44d",41,5,5,2,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

However, a prominent level of subjectivity and a low intra- and inter-rater reproducibility was reported. Therefore, an accurate and reproducible measure of psoriasis severity is needed, especially in the setting of registration studies for systemic anti-psoriatic drugs. Herein we describe a robust, user-friendly, computer-guided technology that allows for automated PASI measurements after total body imaging and digital image analysis. For this purpose, a novel image processing software for PASI calculations was developed, which was combined with a commercially available, automated image capturing system. Our data shows, that the software was able to accurately calculate the proportion of psoriatic skin surface as well as the severity of erythema, induration, and desquamation by anatomic region. In a pilot clinical validation the time-efficient technology showed a high reproducibility and high levels of agreement to results attained by PASI-trained physicians. Therefore, automated computer-guided PASI measurements hold the promise of significantly reducing the physicians' workload while ensuring a high level of reproducibility and standardization.","[Fink, Christine; Enk, Alexander; Haenssle, Holger A.] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Dermatol, Neuenheimer Feld 440, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Fuchs, Tobias] FotoFinder Syst GmbH, Bad Birnbach, Germany","Haenssle, HA (corresponding author), Heidelberg Univ, Dept Dermatol, Neuenheimer Feld 440, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",Holger.Haenssle@med.uni-heidelberg.de,,,,,"Argenziano M, 2006, ANN THORAC SURG, V81, P1666, DOI 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2005.11.00; Berth-Jones J, 2006, BRIT J DERMATOL, V155, P707, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2006.07389.; CIE, 1932, T OPTICAL SOC, V33, P7; Du Bois D, 1916, ARCH INTERN MED, V17, P863, DOI 10.1001/archinte.1916.0008013001000; Esteva A, 2017, NATURE, V542, P115, DOI 10.1038/nature2105; Fink C, 2017, SKIN RES TECHNOL, V23, P261, DOI 10.1111/srt.1235; FREDRIKSSON T, 1978, DERMATOLOGICA, V157, P238, DOI 10.1159/00025083; Gotz TI, 2017, PLOS ONE, V12, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.018360; Haenssle HA, 2018, ANN ONCOL, V29, P1836, DOI 10.1093/annonc/mdy16; Hani AFM, 2014, SURFACE IMAGING BIO; Korotkov K, 2015, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V34, P317, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2014.235771; Kreft S, 2006, J DERMATOL SCI, V44, P21, DOI 10.1016/j.jdermsci.2006.05.00; Langley RG, 2004, J AM ACAD DERMATOL, V51, P563, DOI 10.1016/j.jaad.2004.04.01; Lu J, 2013, IEEE ENG MED BIO, P2380, DOI 10.1109/EMBC.2013.661001; MCLAREN K, 1976, J SOC DYERS COLOUR, V92, P33; Mrowietz U, 2009, DTSCH ARZTEBL INT, V106, P11, DOI 10.3238/arztebl.2009.001; Naldi L, 2010, BRIT J DERMATOL, V162, P384, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2009.09515.; Nast A, 2012, J DTSCH DERMATOL GES, V10, DOI 10.1111/j.1610-0387.2012.07919.; Puzenat E, 2010, J EUR ACAD DERMATOL, V24, P10, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-3083.2009.03562.; RAMSAY B, 1991, BRIT J DERMATOL, V124, P565, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2133.1991.tb04952.; Salerni G, 2012, J AM ACAD DERMATOL, V67, pE17, DOI 10.1016/j.jaad.2011.04.00; Yune YM, 2003, SKIN RES TECHNOL, V9, P339, DOI 10.1034/j.1600-0846.2003.00042.; Zhang Q, 2009, IEEE INT SYMP CIRC S, P1645, DOI 10.1109/ISCAS.2009.511808",23,11,11,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

HIS has the potential to improve individuals' health and providers' performance by producing better quality, cost savings, and greater patient involvement in their own health. There have been two major drivers for the HIS investments in healthcare: The ever-increasing burden from chronic disease with costs growing significantly faster and the recognition of the need for greatly improved quality and safety in health delivery. Maturity models (MM) are based on the premises that people, organizations, functional areas and processes evolve through a process of development or growth towards a more advanced maturity, going through a distinct number of levels. Through a state-of-the-art review of HIS, focused on their maturity state, we identify and characterize a set of critical factors recognized as determinants in the context of HIS maturity. The article identifies a broad spectrum of MM applied to the health sector and its characteristics and reinforces the belief that the maturity of HIS can contribute to the quality of information and knowledge management in the sector.","[Gomes, Jorge; Romao, Mario] ADVANCE, Rua Miguel Lupi 20, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal","Gomes, J (corresponding author), ADVANCE, Rua Miguel Lupi 20, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal.",jorge.gomes@phd.iseg.ulisboa.pt; mario.romao@iseg.ulisboa.pt,"; Gomes, Jorge/N-5087-2015; Gomes, Jorge/D-2231-2017","Romao, Mario/0000-0003-4564-1883; Gomes, Jorge/0000-0003-0656-9284; Gomes, Jorge/0000-0003-0694-2229",,,"AHERN DM, 2003, CMMI DISTILLED PRAC; [Anonymous], 2016, HIMSS DICT HEALTHC ; Aral S, 2012, INFORM SYST RES, V23, P849, DOI 10.1287/isre.1110.040; Berg M, 2001, INT J MED INFORM, V64, P143, DOI 10.1016/S1386-5056(01)00200-; Berg M, 1997, RATIONALIZING MED W; Boer J., 2013, GAME MATURITY MODE; Bragato Laura, 2003, J Health Organ Manag, V17, P164, DOI 10.1108/1477726031048072; Brooks P., 2013, P 46 HAW INT C SYS; Buntin MB, 2011, HEALTH AFFAIR, V30, P464, DOI 10.1377/hlthaff.2011.017; Carvalho JV, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0486-; Chassin MR, 2013, MILBANK Q, V91, P459, DOI 10.1111/1468-0009.1202; Clair CL., 2010, ELECT MED RECORDS N; Cleven A., 2011, RES REPOR; Cleven A.

This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected multicenter data of 88 breast cancer survivors who carried out a 12-week exercise program via smartphone application with pedometer. Personalized programs including aerobic and resistance exercise were prescribed by physiatrists. Also, telephone counseling was performed at the 3rd and 9th week. All patients completed the user satisfaction questionnaire at the end of the intervention. The mean achievement rates of aerobic and resistance exercise for 12weeks were 78.8 and 71.3%, respectively. The mean score of overall satisfaction rated on the 5-point Likert scale was 4.22 +/- 0.73. When the patients were grouped according to age, the overall satisfaction score increased significantly with age (P=0.040). Also, the satisfaction scores of patients with radiotherapy were significantly higher than patients without radiotherapy (P=0.001). In terms of system characteristics, the most satisfying was data transmission accuracy (4.32 +/- 0.74). In addition, patients were very satisfied with telephone counseling (4.55 +/- 0.62). The results suggest the direction of mHealth should go to meet the detailed requirements of the specific user group as a more targeted approach. In addition, if a mutual feedback platform can be implanted in mHealth applications, it will increase user loyalty and make mHealth a more available motivational technology in our lives.","[Lee, Hannah; Cheong, In Yae; Hwang, Ji Hye] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Med, Dept Phys & Rehabil Med, Samsung Med Ctr, 81 Irwon Ro, Seoul 06351, South Korea; [Uhm, Kyeong Eun] Konkuk Univ, Sch Med, Dept Rehabil Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Yoo, Ji Sung; Chung, Seung Hyun] Natl Canc Ctr, Dept Rehabil Med, Goyang Si, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Park, Yong Hyun; Lee, Ji Youl] Catholic Univ Korea, Dept Urol, Seoul St Marys Hosp, Coll Med, Seoul, South Korea","Hwang, JH (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Med, Dept Phys & Rehabil Med, Samsung Med Ctr, 81 Irwon Ro, Seoul 06351, South Korea.",hwanglee@skku.edu,,,"National Information Society Agency (NIA) - Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (Smart After Care Service for Cancer and Cardiac Disease)","This research was supported by the National Information Society Agency (NIA) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (Smart After Care Service for Cancer and Cardiac Disease).","Aljasir B., 2010, Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal, V16, P108; Arrington AK, 2014, AM SURGEON, V80, P60; Bentzen SM, 2000, ACTA ONCOL, V39, P337, DOI 10.1080/02841860075001311; Bohannon RW, 2015, ARCH PHYS MED REHAB, V96, P472, DOI 10.1016/j.apmr.2014.10.00; Bonn SE, 2018, BMC PUBLIC HEALTH, V18, DOI 10.1186/s12889-018-5026-; Bravo Carolina, 2014, J Health Dispar Res Pract, V; Carter MC, 2013, J MED INTERNET RES, V15, DOI 10.2196/jmir.228; Chae YM, 2001, INT J MED INFORM, V61, P167, DOI 10.1016/S1386-5056(01)00139-; Chun MY, 2012, KOREAN J FAM MED, V33, P144, DOI 10.4082/kjfm.2012.33.3.14; Comulada WS, 2018, PUBLIC HEALTH NUTR, V21, P679, DOI [10.1017/S1368980017003044, 10.1017/s1368980017003044; Courneya KS, 2003, MED SCI SPORT EXER, V35, P1846, DOI 10.1249/01.MSS.0000093622.41587.B; Dieli-Conwright CM, 2015, BREAST CANCER-TARGET, V7, P353, DOI 10.2147/BCTT.S8203; Eakin EG, 2012, ANN BEHAV MED, V43, P229, DOI 10.1007/s12160-011-9324-; FITZPATRICK R, 1991, BRIT MED J, V302, P887, DOI 10.1136/bmj.302.6781.88; Fox S., 2012, PEW RES CTR INTERNE; Glynn LG, 2014, BRIT J GEN PRACT, V64, pE384, DOI 10.3399/bjgp14X68046; Gubbi J, 2013, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V29, P1645, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2013.01.01; Gustafson DH, 2014, JAMA PSYCHIAT, V71, P566, DOI 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.464; Hojris I, 2000, ACTA ONCOL, V39, P355, DOI 10.1080/02841860075001313; Holmes MD, 2005, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V293, P2479, DOI 10.1001/jama.293.20.247; IPAQ Research Committee, 2005, GUIDELINES DATA PRO; Istepanian R.

In particular, degenerative diseases of the retina such as macular senile degenerations are on the rise and affect millions of people with hundreds of thousands of new cases each year. These diseases can cause profoundly disabling visual impairments, in some cases severely compromising the central and/or the peripheral vision in one or both eyes. In this paper, we present a novel vision aids technology that allows for correcting or attenuating the perception of visual field defects due to ocular pathologies of diverse origins or traumas by using techniques of 3D visualisation, eye tracking, and image processing. The presented technology is mainly conceived for providing vision aids that can significantly improve the quality of life of people with this kind of visual disorders. As well, it could be employed for supporting the diagnosis of ocular dysfunctions and for monitoring the progression of diseases.

However, ICA-based MIBCI (ICA-MIBCI) is sensitive to electroencephalogram (EEG) channels and the quality of the training data, which are two crucial factors affecting the stability and classification performance of ICA-MIBCI. To address these problems, this paper is mainly focused on the investigation of EEG channel optimization. As a reference, we constructed a single-trial-based ICA-MIBCI system with commonly used channels and common spatial pattern-based MIBCI (CSP-MIBCI). To minimize the impact of artifacts on EEG channel optimization, a data-quality evaluation method, named self-testing in this paper, was used in a single-trial-based ICA-MIBCI system to evaluate the quality of single trials in each dataset; the resulting self-testing accuracies were used for the selection of high-quality trials. Given several candidate channel configurations, ICA filters were calculated using selected high-quality trials and applied to the corresponding ICA-MIBCI implementation. Optimal channels for each dataset were assessed and selected according to the self-testing results related to various candidate configurations. Forty-eight MI datasets of six subjects were employed in this study to validate the proposed methods. Experimental results revealed that the average classification accuracy of the optimal channels yielded a relative increment of 2.8% and 8.5% during self-testing, 14.4% and 9.5% during session-to-session transfer, and 36.2% and 26.7% during subject-to-subject transfer compared to CSP-MIBCI and ICA-MIBCI with fixed the channel configuration. This work indicates that the proposed methods can efficiently improve the practical feasibility of ICA-MIBCI.","[Ruan, Jing; Wu, Xiaopei; Zhou, Bangyan; Guo, Xiaojing; Lv, Zhao] Anhui Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Intelligent Comp & Signal Proc, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Ruan, Jing; Wu, Xiaopei; Zhou, Bangyan; Guo, Xiaojing; Lv, Zhao] Anhui Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China","Wu, XP (corresponding author), Anhui Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Intelligent Comp & Signal Proc, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.;Wu, XP (corresponding author), Anhui Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.",wxp2001@ahu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [61271352] Funding Source: Medline; University Natural Science Research Project of Anhui Province [KJ2016A043] Funding Source: Medline; Anhui University Center of Information Support & Assurance Technology Open Foundation [ADXXBZ201505] Funding Source: Medline,,"Abibullaev B, 2012, J MED SYST, V36, P2675, DOI 10.1007/s10916-011-9742-; Amari S, 1999, NEURAL COMPUT, V11, P1875, DOI 10.1162/08997669930001599; Ang KK, 2015, CLIN EEG NEUROSCI, V46, P310, DOI 10.1177/155005941452222; Ang KK, 2011, CLIN EEG NEUROSCI, V42, P253, DOI 10.1177/15500594110420041; Arvaneh M., 2012, NEUR NETW IJCNN 2012, P; Arvaneh M, 2014, IEEE ENG MED BIO, P6501, DOI 10.1109/EMBC.2014.694511; Arvaneh M, 2011, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V58, P1865, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2011.213114; Blankertz B, 2010, FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ, V4, DOI 10.3389/fnins.2010.0019; Brunner C, 2007, PATTERN RECOGN LETT, V28, P957, DOI 10.1016/j.patrec.2007.01.00; Delorme A, 2012, PLOS ONE, V7, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.003013; Doud AJ, 2011, PLOS ONE, V6, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.002632; Farquhar J., 2006, REGULARISED CSP SEN; Ghaemi A, 2017, BIOMED SIGNAL PROCES, V33, P109, DOI 10.1016/j.bspc.2016.11.01; He B, 2015, P IEEE, V103, P907, DOI [10.1109/JPROC.2015.2407272, 10.1109/jproc.2015.2407272; Hung CI, 2005, ANN BIOMED ENG, V33, P1053, DOI 10.1007/s10439-005-5772-; Hyvarinen A., 2013, ENCY COMPUT NEUROSCI, P; Jayaram V, 2016, IEEE COMPUT INTELL M, V11, P20, DOI 10.1109/MCI.2015.250154; Kevric J, 2017, BIOMED SIGNAL PROCES, V31, P398, DOI 10.1016/j.bspc.2016.09.00; Kirar JS, 2018, J MED SYST, V42, DOI 10.1007/s10916-018-0931-; LaFleur K, 2013, J NEURAL ENG, V10, DOI 10.1088/1741-2560/10/4/04600; Lal TN, 2004, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V51, P1003, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2004.82782; Lan T., 2005, ENG MED BIOL SOC 200, P706; Lee C, 2012, IEEE ENG MED BIO, P5290, DOI 10.1109/EMBC.2012.634718; Lin BS, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0442-; Lin Cheng-Chung, 2012, HANDOVER ALGORITHM J, P; Liu K.

The proposed computational model is used to predict the magnitude of current density and magnitude of electric field distribution generated across the target region of cerebral cortex for specific small size 1x1cm(2) multi-electrode HD-tDCS configurations. The current works aims at optimizing the number of electrodes and current density for multielectrode HD-tDCS configuration and weak current intensity is obtained by calculating surface area and penetration depth of target region of cerebral cortex. In terms of surface area and penetration depth 4x1 HD-tDCS and 2mA weak dc current configuration has been selected. The optimized 4x1 HD-tDCS configuration is placed on target location of the brain surface and the changes in the magnitude of current density and magnitude of electric field distribution is calculated at the different locations on brain surface including scalp surface, skull surface gray matter and white matter surface. The variation in magnitude electric field distribution is seen in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), gray and white matter surface of target cerebral cortex. Based on the insights received from the variation in the magnitude of current density and magnitude of electric field distribution, the design of an appropriate NIRS probe has been proposed to aid in non-invasive brain stimulation. Designed NIRS probe is based on distance of separation between source and photodetector to cover the affected area with 4x1 HD-tDCS technique and measurement sensitivity distribution at gray matter surface of cerebral cortex. The estimated percentage of pixel area of measurement sensitivity distribution is 17.094%, which confirm to cover the 7.9384% distributed pixel area in term of calculated magnitude of current density affected with 4x1 HD-tDCS configuration.","[Sharma, Gaurav; Chowdhury, Shubhajit Roy] Indian Inst Technol Mandi, Sch Comp & Elect Engn, Biomed Syst Lab, MANAS Grp, Kamand, Himachal Prades, India","Chowdhury, SR (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Mandi, Sch Comp & Elect Engn, Biomed Syst Lab, MANAS Grp, Kamand, Himachal Prades, India.",src@iitmandi.ac.in,"Roy Chowdhury, Shubhajit/K-8748-2018","Roy Chowdhury, Shubhajit/0000-0003-1878-6657; sharma, gaurav/0000-0001-7934-0531",,,"Aasted CM, 2015, NEUROPHOTONICS, V2, DOI 10.1117/1.NPh.2.2.02080; Adhika DR, 2012, BIOMED ENG-BIOMED TE, V57, P609, DOI 10.1515/bmt-2012-448; Akhtari M, 2002, BRAIN TOPOGR, V14, P151, DOI 10.1023/A:101459092318; Almajidy R.

Conventional manual assessment methods mainly rely on personal experience in observing X-ray images of left hand and wrist to calculate bone age, which show some intrinsic limitations from low efficiency to unstable accuracy. To address these problems, some automated methods based on image processing or machine learning have been proposed, while their performances are not satisfying enough yet in assessment accuracy. Motivated by the remarkable success of deep learning (DL) techniques in the fields of image classification and speech recognition, we develop a deep automated skeletal bone age assessment model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and support vector regression (SVR) using multiple kernel learning (MKL) algorithm to process heterogeneous features in this paper. This deep framework has been constructed, not only exploring the X-ray images of hand and twist but also some other heterogeneous information like race and gender. The experiment results prove its better performance with higher bone age assessment accuracy on two different data sets compared with the state of the art, indicating that the fused heterogeneous features provide a better description of the degree of bones' maturation.","[Tong, Chao; Liang, Baoyu; Li, Jun] Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Tong, Chao; Liang, Baoyu; Li, Jun] Zhengzhou Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Natl Engn Lab Internet Med Syst & Applicat, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Zhigao] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China","Zheng, ZG (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",zhengzhigao@hust.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [61472024, U1433203]; National Engineering Laboratory for Internet Medical System and Application [NELIMSA2018P01]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61472024, U1433203), Project of National Engineering Laboratory for Internet Medical System and Application (NELIMSA2018P01).","Adeshina S.A., 2014, EL COMP COMP ICECCO, P; Bach F.R., 2004, P 21 INT C MACH LEAR, P6, DOI DOI 10.1145/1015330.101542; BEUNEN G, 1990, ANN HUM BIOL, V17, P355, DOI 10.1080/0301446900000114; Chen H, 2016, THIRTIETH AAAI CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, P116; Chollet F., 2015, KERA; Giordano D, 2016, COMPUT METH PROG BIO, V124, P138, DOI 10.1016/j.cmpb.2015.10.01; Greulich W, 1959, AM J MED SCI, V23; Haak D., 2013, SPIE MED IMAGIN; Harmsen M., 2012, BILDVERARBEITUNG MED, V2012, P43; Hsieh CW, 2010, MED BIOL ENG COMPUT, V48, P579, DOI 10.1007/s11517-010-0609-; Kim Y, 2016, THIRTIETH AAAI CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, P274; Krizhevsky A, 2012, ADV NEURAL INFOR MAT, DOI 10.1145/306538; Liu J, 2008, COMPUT MED IMAG GRAP, V32, P678, DOI 10.1016/j.compmedimag.2008.08.00; Liu SQ, 2014, I S BIOMED IMAGING, P1015, DOI 10.1109/ISBI.2014.686804; MICHAEL DJ, 1989, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V8, P64, DOI 10.1109/42.2036; Pietka E, 2001, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V20, P715, DOI 10.1109/42.93824; Rakotomamonjy A, 2008, J MACH LEARN RES, V9, P249; Salleh SH., 2011, INT J MATH MODELS ME, V5, P62; Seeman E, 1998, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V83, P1414, DOI 10.1210/jc.83.5.141; Seok J, 2016, EXPERT SYST APPL, V50, P75, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2015.12.01; Simonyan K., 2015, ARXIV14091556C; Somkantha K, 2011, J DIGIT IMAGING, V24, P1044, DOI 10.1007/s10278-011-9372-; Spampinato C, 2017, MED IMAGE ANAL, V36, P41, DOI 10.1016/j.media.2016.10.01; Thodberg HH, 2009, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V28, P52, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2008.92606; Tu Y., 2018, SEMISUPERVISED LEAR; Wu QD, 2014, MATH PROBL ENG, V2014, DOI 10.1155/2014/58601; Wu QD, 2017, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V76, P17179, DOI 10.1007/s11042-016-3760-",27,12,13,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In this paper, a research is carried based on the stochastic investigation on the some of attributes of traffic with the help of cloud in street portion to accept the necessary attribute prototypes. In this paper two types of activity is done, first one is free flow movement of vehicle and second one is queuing- up activity. For the first activity, a noticeable traffic model is used to find the free flow movement of the vehicle and some parameters like activity thickness, living time and quantity of vehicles. In case of second activity queuing up model is used to find queue flow and parameters like length of line and time in the line are found. The research outcome will be given to all peoples in road traffic and traffic is the problem in many developed countries and they can be free from traffic. This model suggests an alternate route for the user which is free from traffic.","[Vijayarangam, S.; Megalai, J.] Priyadarshini Engn Coll, Vaniyambadi, Tamil Nadu, India; [Krishnan, Sivakumar] Rathinam Tech Campus, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Nagarajan, Sivakumar] Vellore Inst Technol, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Devi, M.

In order to run the Treatment Pathways in Chronic Disease protocol in Chinese data sources,we have built a large data research and analysis platform for Chinese clinical medical data. Data sourced from the Clinical Data Repository (CDR) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University was extracted, transformed, and loaded into an observational medical outcomes partnership common data model (OMOP CDM) Ver. 5.0. Diagnosis and medication information for patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and depression from 2005 to 2015 were extracted for observational research to obtain treatment pathways for the three diseases. The most common medications used to treat diabetes and hypertension were metformin and acarbose, respectively, at 28.5 and 20.9% as first-line medication. New drugs were emerging for depression; therefore, the favorite medication changed accordingly. Most patients with these three diseases had different treatment pathways from other patients with the same diseases. The proportions of monotherapy increased for the three diseases, especially in recent years. The recommendations presented in guidelines show some predominance. High-quality, effective guidelines incorporating domestic facts should be established to further guide medication and improve therapy at local hospitals. Medical institutions at all levels could improve the quality of medical services, and further standardize medications in the future.

Normal variations of lung consistent with the maintenance of pulmonary health and abnormal lung variations can be as a result of a pulmonary disease. Inter-patient lung variations can be due to the several factors such as sex, age, height, weight and type of disease. This study tries to show the inter-patient lung variations by using one of the shape-based descriptions techniques which is called Fourier descriptors. Shape-based description is an important approach to construct an object according to its parametric values. A different types of techniques are reported in the literature that aim to represent objects based on their shapes; each of these techniques has its cons and pros. Fourier descriptors, a simple yet powerful technique, has interesting properties such as rotational, scale, and translational invariance and these are powerful features for the recognition of two-dimensional connected shapes. In this paper, we use 380 CXR (Chest X-ray) images as a training set to construct the statistical mean model of lung contour. For modelling, the first step is evaluation of lung contour approximation and characterization to get the good spatial and frequency resolution. In the second step, all of the lung contours registered to show the variation and make a mean shape (i.e. lungs). And the final step is calculating the dispersion (i.e. covariance matrix) and analyzing by principle components. The proposed technique used to create the inter-patient statistical model and provide statistical parameters for application in segmentation, classification, 2D atlas based registration, etc. In this paper, we presented an approach for creating 2D modelling of human lungs from CXR image archives and reported some interesting statistical parameters to analysis the left and the right lung shape.","[Afzali, Ali; Mofrad, Farshid Babapour] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Med Radiat Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Pouladian, Majid] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Biomed Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Pouladian, Majid] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Res Ctr Engn Med & Biol, Tehran, Iran","Mofrad, FB (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Med Radiat Engn, Tehran, Iran.",farshid.mofrad@yahoo.com,"Pouladian, Majid/AAA-2864-2019; Afzali, Ali/AAU-5097-2020; Mofrad, Farshid Babapour/ABH-7935-2020","Pouladian, Majid/0000-0001-6081-6376; Afzali, Ali/0000-0001-9728-0560; Mofrad, Farshid Babapour/0000-0002-5892-7971",,,"Ahmed Fareed, 2013, International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications (VISAPP 2013).

This collective form of monitoring sensor devices forms a very short-range Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) and plays a key role in the data gathering process. If any sensor node in the network detects abnormal values that should be transmitted promptly via wireless medium with less delay. A single medium allows one-way delivery of a data packet, and it may not be sufficient to satisfy the high volume of communication demand between the sensor nodes in the network. In the same way, the packet prioritization does not guarantee the packet will get there on time and sometime it may cause priority conflicts among the nodes. It is only mean that the flow of delivery service handles that critical data packet before handling other data packets. However, unexploited time slots and bandwidth wastage will occur due to inefficient backoff management and collisions. To minimize the aforementioned issues, various backoff procedures, adaptive slot allocation mechanisms, priority-based medium access control protocols have been developed but suffer limitations in the context of providing priority-based channel access with less backoff conflicts and dedicated allocation of time slots for critical nodes in all cases. Based on these deliberations, a more effective Traffic Priority-based Channel Access Technique (TP-CAT) is proposed using IEEE 802.15.6 in order to minimize the transmission delay of critical data packet and solve conflicts among other priority nodes during the backoff phases. Firstly, a Low Threshold Criticality-based Adaptive Time slot Allocation algorithm (LT-CATA) is presented to decrease the priority slot conflicts between the low threshold data traffic from the same and different type of user prioritynodes. Secondly, a High Threshold Criticality-based Adaptive Time slot Allocation algorithm (HT-CATA) is developed to reduce the priority slot conflicts between the high threshold data traffic from the same and different types of user prioritynodes. Additionally, a novel Random Overlapping Backoff value Avoidance (ROBA) technique is introduced to eliminate the overlapping issue during the selection of random backoff value among the sensor nodes. Since, the proposed technique greatly reduced the channel access delay and transmissiondelay of critical data packet as well as other types of priority data packet. The Simulation results are verified in the CASTALIA 3.2 framework using omnet++ network simulater to relatively evaluate the performance metrics of the TP-CAT technique with state-of-the-art protocols. From the analysis of the results, it is evident that the TP-CAT technique provides better performance in terms of delay, energy consumption, and throughput in healthcare monitoring environments.","[Ambigavathi, M.; Sridharan, D.] Anna Univ, Dept ECE, CEG Campus, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India","Ambigavathi, M (corresponding author), Anna Univ, Dept ECE, CEG Campus, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.",ambigaindhu8@gmail.com; sridhar@annauniv.edu,"M, Ambigavathi/O-9062-2018; D, Sridharan/AAQ-7361-2020","M, Ambigavathi/0000-0002-2501-7349; D, Sridharan/0000-0001-7248-7709",University Grant Commission [F1-17.1/2014-15/RGNF-2014-15-SC-TAM-71494],This research work was supported by the National Fellowship grant funded by the University Grant Commission (Grant No. F1-17.1/2014-15/RGNF-2014-15-SC-TAM-71494).

Medical diagnosis relies heavily on Data Mining for automated disease classification and detection. It relies on data mining algorithms to examine medical data. Liver diseases have become more common these days with many new patients being diagnosed with Heptasis B and C. Early diagnosis of Liver Disorder is essential for treatment. It can be achieved by setting up intelligent systems for early diagnose and prognosis of Liver diseases. The existing automated classification systems lack accuracy in results when compared to surgical biopsy. We propose a new hybrid model for liver syndrome classification for analysis of the patient's medical data via hybrid artificial neural network. The medical records are classified based on the possibility of existence of disease. The proposed method uses M-PSO for feature selection of input variables and M-ANN algorithm for disease classification. The presented hybrid approach significantly improves the accuracy compared to existing classification algorithms. The results of the algorithm were examined and evaluated using Spark tool in this work.,"[Anand, L.; Ibrahim, S. P.

In this paper, the dual encryption procedure is utilized to encrypt the medical images. Initially Blowfish Encryption is considered and then signcryption algorithm is utilized to confirm the encryption model. After that, the Opposition based Flower Pollination (OFP) is utilized to upgrade the private and public keys. The performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated using performance measures such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), entropy, Mean Square Error (MSE), and Correlation Coefficient (CC).","[Avudaiappan, T.] K Ramakrishnan Coll Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India; [Balasubramanian, R.] Manonmaniam Sundaranar Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, India; [Pandiyan, S.

Cervical cancer classification utilizing gene expression data depends upon conventional supervised learning methods, wherein only labeled data could be used for learning. The previous methodologies had problem with appropriate feature selection as well as accurateness of classification outcomes. So, the entire performance of the cancer classification is decreased meaningfully. With the aim of overcoming the aforesaid problems, Enhanced Bat Optimization Algorithm with Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (EBO-HSIC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is presented in this research for identifying the specific genes from the gene expression dataset that belongs to cancer microarray. This proposed system contains phases of instance normalization, module detection, gene selection and classification. By Fuzzy C Means (FCM) algorithm, the normalization is performed for eliminating the inappropriate features from the gene dataset. Meanwhile, for effective feature selection, the EBO algorithm is used for producing more appropriate features via improved objective function values. For determining a subset of the most informative genes utilizing a rapid as well as scalable bat algorithm, this proposed method focuses on measuring the dependence amid Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) as well as the gene significance. The algorithm is dependent upon the HSIC and was partially enthused by EBO. With the help of SVM classifier, these gene features are categorized very precisely. Experimentation outcomes demonstrate that the presented EBO with SVM algorithm confirms a clear-cut classification performance for the given gene expression datasets. Hence the result provides higher performance by launching EBO with SVM algorithm to obtain greater accuracy, recall, precision, f-measure and less time complexity more willingly than the previous techniques.","[Geeitha, S.] Mahendra Engn Coll Women, Dept Informat Technol, Tiruchengode, India; [Thangamani, M.] Kongu Engn Coll, Dept Comp Sci Engn, Perundurai, India","Geeitha, S (corresponding author), Mahendra Engn Coll Women, Dept Informat Technol, Tiruchengode, India.",geeitha.s@gmail.com,"S, Geeitha/AAY-8898-2021; M, Thangamani/AAL-7755-2020","S, Geeitha/0000-0001-9157-4971; M, Thangamani/0000-0001-8864-3315",,,"Arbyn M, 2011, ANN ONCOL, V22, P2675, DOI 10.1093/annonc/mdr01; Bergmann S, 2004, PLOS BIOL, V2, P85, DOI 10.1371/journal.pbio.002000; Bhattacharya A, 2014, INT J ECON SCI, V3, P; Bruni L B-RL, 2015, HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRU; Chen XJ, 2011, J BIOMED RES, V25, P155, DOI [10.1016/S1674-8301(11)60018-3, 10.1016/S1674-8301(11)60020-1; Cheng QA, 2011, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V33, P1217, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.2010.19; Chu F, 2005, STUD FUZZ SOFT COMP, V177, P34; Chuang KS, 2006, COMPUT MED IMAG GRAP, V30, P9, DOI 10.1016/j.compmedimag.2005.10.00; Croce CM, 2008, NEW ENGL J MED, V358, P502, DOI 10.1056/NEJMra07236; Denny L, 2012, DISCOV MED, V14, P12; DiLeo MV, 2011, PLOS ONE, V6, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.002668; Fung GM, 2005, MACH LEARN, V59, P77, DOI 10.1007/s10994-005-0463-; Gadducci A, 2011, GYNECOL ENDOCRINOL, V27, P597, DOI 10.3109/09513590.2011.55895; Gandomi AH, 2013, NEURAL COMPUT APPL, V22, P1239, DOI 10.1007/s00521-012-1028-; Garcia S, 2009, SOFT COMPUT, V13, P959, DOI 10.1007/s00500-008-0392-; Gretton A, 2005, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V3734, P6; Guyon I., 2003, J MACH LEARN RES, V3, P1157, DOI DOI 10.1162/15324430332275361; Hernandez JCH, 2008, COMM COM INF SC, V13, P49; Huang DS, 2013, IEEE ACM T COMPUT BI, V10, P457, DOI 10.1109/TCBB.2013.1; Hudson NJ, 2009, PLOS COMPUT BIOL, V5, DOI 10.1371/journal.pcbi.100038; Langfelder P, 2008, BIOINFORMATICS, V24, P719, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btm56; Langfelder P, 2008, BMC BIOINFORMATICS, V9, DOI 10.1186/1471-2105-9-55; Lee HS, 2015, ONCOL LETT, V9, P1691, DOI 10.3892/ol.2015.291; Lee KS, 2005, COMPUT METHOD APPL M, V194, P3902, DOI 10.1016/j.cma.2004.09.00; Maji P, 2009, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V56, P1063, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2008.200450; Min JH, 2005, EXPERT SYST APPL, V28, P603, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2004.12.00; Mine KL, 2013, NAT COMMUN, V4, DOI 10.1038/ncomms269; Ongenaert M, 2008, BMC MED GENOMICS, V1, DOI 10.1186/1755-8794-1-5; Peng HC, 2005, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V27, P1226, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.2005.15; Pepe MS, 2008, J NATL CANCER I, V100, P1432, DOI 10.1093/jnci/djn32; Rai P., 2010, INT J COMPUTER APPL, V7, P1, DOI DOI 10.5120/1326-180; Satija A., 2014, CERVICAL CANC INDI; Sokolova M, 2009, INFORM PROCESS MANAG, V45, P427, DOI 10.1016/j.ipm.2009.03.00; Song L, 2007, BIOINFORMATICS, V23, pI490, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btm21; Spitzer F., 2013, PRINCIPLES RANDOM WA, V3; Stuart C, 2006, GYNAECOLOGY 10 TEAC; Tang EK, 2005, Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, P; Thomas A, 2013, CANCER MED-US, V2, P836, DOI 10.1002/cam4.15; Van der Laan MJ, 2003, J STAT COMPUT SIM, V73, P575, DOI 10.1080/009496503100013601; Viswam V, 2016, 2016 5 INT C EL DEV, P1, DOI DOI 10.1109/ICEDSA.2016.781850; Wang SL, 2012, IEEE ACM T COMPUT BI, V9, P580, DOI 10.1109/TCBB.2011.13; Wang SS, 2010, PLOS ONE, V5, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.000866; Widodo A, 2007, MECH SYST SIGNAL PR, V21, P2560, DOI 10.1016/j.ymssp.2006.12.00; Yang XS, 2012, ENG COMPUTATION, V29, P464, DOI 10.1108/0264440121123583; Yang XS, 2011, INT J BIO-INSPIR COM, V3, P267, DOI 10.1504/IJBIC.2011.04225; Yang XS, 2010, STUD COMPUT INTELL, V284, P65, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-12538-6_; Yeole Balkrishna Bhika, 2004, Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, V5, P30; Zhang SH, 2007, PHYSICA A, V374, P483, DOI 10.1016/j.physa.2006.07.02",48,9,10,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Many researchers reported automated diagnosis of maculopathy from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no literature that presents a complete 3D suite for the extraction as well as diagnosis of macula. Therefore, this paper presents a multilayered convolutional neural networks (CNN) structure tensor Delaunay triangulation and morphing based fully autonomous system that extracts up to nine retinal and choroidal layers along with the macular fluids. Furthermore, the proposed system utilizes the extracted retinal information for the automated diagnosis of maculopathy as well as for the robust reconstruction of 3D macula of retina. The proposed system has been validated on 41,921 retinal OCT scans acquired from different OCT machines and it significantly outperformed existing state of the art solutions by achieving the mean accuracy of 95.27% for extracting retinal and choroidal layers, mean dice coefficient of 0.90 for extracting fluid pathology and the overall accuracy of 96.07% for maculopathy diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is first of its kind that provides a fully automated and complete 3D integrated solution for the extraction of candidate macula along with its fully automated diagnosis against different macular syndromes.","[Hassan, Taimur; Akram, M.

To perform well on a given task, these algorithms require large dataset for training However, deep learning algorithms lack generalization and suffer from over-fitting whenever trained on small dataset, especially when one is dealing with medical images. For supervised image analysis in medical imaging, having image data along with their corresponding annotated ground-truths is costly as well as time consuming since annotations of the data is done by medical experts manually. In this paper, we propose a new Generative Adversarial Network for Medical Imaging (MI-GAN). The MI-GAN generates synthetic medical images and their segmented masks, which can then be used for the application of supervised analysis of medical images. Particularly, we present MI-GAN for synthesis of retinal images. The proposed method generates precise segmented images better than the existing techniques. The proposed model achieves a dice coefficient of 0.837 on STARE dataset and 0.832 on DRIVE dataset which is state-of-the-art performance on both the datasets.","[Iqbal, Talha; Ali, Hazrat] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Elect Engn, Abbottabad Campus, Islamabad, Pakistan","Ali, H (corresponding author), COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Elect Engn, Abbottabad Campus, Islamabad, Pakistan.",hazratali@ciit.net.pk,,"Ali, Hazrat/0000-0003-3058-5794; Iqbal, Talha/0000-0001-9505-2732",,,"[Anonymous], 2016, 2016 INT C LEARNIN; Barbu A, 2018, COMP M BIO BIO E-IV, V6, P253, DOI 10.1080/21681163.2016.113824; Baumgartner Christian F., 2016, Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention - MICCAI 2016. 19th International Conference.

NR-IQA is proposed due to till now there is no perfect reference image for finding the quality of real time medical imaging. It is an effective method for assessing the real-world medical images. The proposed method takes the distorted image as an input and estimate the quality of the image without the assistance of reference image. The techniques CSO and DNN with NR-IQA produces the quality of the image with high quality score and low Mean Square Error (MSE). Also, the proposed method is used to improve the quality score thereby improving the quality of the image. So that the resultant image has good visual properties which is useful for the analysis of further medical proceedings. The simulation result shows that the proposed system improves the quality score by 8% when compared to the other existing systems. The SROCC value can be increased as 6%, 14%, 6 and 2% for the different existing methods such as NR-BIQA, SBVQP-ML, PTQL/PTVC and NR-SIQA (3D) respectively.","[Jayageetha, J.] SNS Coll Technol, Dept ECE, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Vasanthanayaki, C.] Govt Coll Technol, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India","Jayageetha, J (corresponding author), SNS Coll Technol, Dept ECE, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.",jayageethajaganathan@gmail.com; vasanthi@gct.ac.in,,,,,"Abdalmajeed S, 2014, ELECTRON LETT, V50, P595, DOI 10.1049/el.2013.358; Ahilan A, 2016, INFORM MIDEM, V46, P25; Ahilan A, 2016, ADV INTELL SYST, V412, P237, DOI 10.1007/978-981-10-0251-9_2; Ahilan A, 2015, MICROELECTRON RELIAB, V55, P2108, DOI 10.1016/j.microrel.2015.06.07; Ahilan A, 2015, MALAYSIA, V6, P5; Akhter R., 2010, P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS, P752; Bosse S, 2018, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V27, P206, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2017.276051; Chen MJ, 2013, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V22, P3379, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2013.226739; Chow LS, 2016, BIOMED SIGNAL PROCES, V27, P145, DOI 10.1016/j.bspc.2016.02.00; Cohen E, 2010, SIGNAL IMAGE VIDEO P, V4, P289, DOI 10.1007/s11760-009-0117-; Dosselmann R., 2011, 20112 C; Fu Y., 2016, INT S COMP CONS CON; Hou WL, 2015, IEEE T NEUR NET LEAR, V26, P1275, DOI 10.1109/TNNLS.2014.233685; Joshi P, 2017, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V76, P18871, DOI 10.1007/s11042-017-4418-; Kang L., 2014, IEEE INT C IM P ICI; Kang L, 2014, PROC CVPR IEEE, P4034, DOI 10.1109/CVPR.2014.51; Kavukcuoglu K., 2010, ADV NEURAL INFORM PR, P109; Li Y., 2017, IEEE INT C DIG SIG; Moorthy AK, 2011, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V20, P3350, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2011.214732; Puntura A., 2016, IEEE INT C CONTR SY; Sazzad ZMP, 2008, SIGNAL PROCESS-IMAGE, V23, P257, DOI 10.1016/j.image.2008.03.00; Shao F, 2015, IEEE T BROADCAST, V61, P154, DOI 10.1109/TBC.2015.240249; Sheikh HR, 2005, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V14, P2117, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2005.85938; Shen L, 2018, IEEE T EMERG TOP COM, V99, P; Wang S.Y., 2014, P 2014 IEEE S COMP C, P1, DOI [10.1109/ISCC.2014.6912609, DOI 10.1109/ISCC.2014.6912609; Zhang C, 2014, ADV INFORM SCI SERV, V1, P",26,1,1,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Nowadays, abdominal surface electrogastrography is the one of methods of stomach examination that is used for diagnosing patients with chronic intractable nausea, vomiting and gastroparesis. The electrogastrographic signals are recorded by using cutaneous electrodes placed on the stomach surface. EGG DWPack system is a highly developed and easy to use software package for four channel electrogastrography recording and analysis. The part of the software for analysis is a MATLAB based software and requires the specific ASCII format of the EGG data. The analyzed EGG signals could be conditioned with the wide range of sampling frequency and various resolutions of analog to digital conversion. Additionally, if the EGG data fulfills certain conditions associated with sampling frequency, the software can be used to study the basic parameters of heart rate variability (HRV) simultaneously with the EGG parameters. The software includes different digital filters for the EGG signal extraction and tools for artifacts exclusion. The software computes the majority of EGG parameters which are commonly used in a clinical practice. The EGG analysis can be made for several adjustable analysis settings and various methods, and it can optimize the analysis methods for different preferences or requirements. The analysis result can be saved in a MAT-file, and exported to MS Excel and ASCII files. Validation of the software was performed using synthetic and real EGG signals. This paper contains, as an example of use, an analysis of four synthetic, and fourteen human 4-channel EGG data recording with water, yogurt and a solid meal stimulation. The mean values of the dominant frequency for fast, and postprandial stage were found to be 2.96 +/- 0.21 cpm (cycle per minute), and 3.05 +/- 0.33 cpm, respectively. The values established in the validation process are consistent with typical human physiological values. In addition, the results were compared to outcomes from commercial system. The results of validation have proved that EGG DWPack software produces reliable outcomes. The software is available for free of charge for Windows operating system for the all possible non commercial use.","[Komorowski, Dariusz] Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Biomed Engn, Dept Biosensors & Proc Biomed Signals, Zabrze, Poland","Komorowski, D (corresponding author), Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Biomed Engn, Dept Biosensors & Proc Biomed Signals, Zabrze, Poland.",dariusz.komorowski@polsl.pl,"Komorowski, Dariusz/Q-3461-2018","Komorowski, Dariusz/0000-0003-4430-6047",,,"Akay M., 2012, BIOMED SIGNAL PROCE; Camm AJ, 1996, CIRCULATION, V93, P104; Chen DD, 2008, J GASTROEN HEPATOL, V23, P141, DOI 10.1111/j.1440-1746.2007.05123.; CHEN J, 1991, MED BIOL ENG COMPUT, V29, P339, DOI 10.1007/BF0244165; Chen JDZ, 1999, AM J PHYSIOL-GASTR L, V277, pG424, DOI 10.1152/ajpgi.1999.277.2.G42; Chen JDZ, 1996, DIGEST DIS SCI, V41, P1538, DOI 10.1007/BF0208789; Cheng LK, 2010, WIRES SYST BIOL MED, V2, P65, DOI 10.1002/wsbm.1; Du P, 2018, FRONT PHYSIOL, V8, DOI 10.3389/fphys.2017.0113; Emanuel Parzen, 1998, SELECTED PAPERS HIR; Friesen CA, 2007, NEUROGASTROENT MOTIL, V19, P376, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2007.00906.; Goldberger AL, 2000, CIRCULATION, V101, pE215, DOI 10.1161/01.CIR.101.23.e21; HAMILTON JW, 1986, DIGEST DIS SCI, V31, P33, DOI 10.1007/BF0134790; HARRIS FJ, 1978, P IEEE, V66, P51, DOI 10.1109/PROC.1978.1083; Koch KL, 2011, NEUROGASTROENT MOTIL, V23, P815, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2982.2011.01756.; Koch Kenneth L, 2004, HDB ELECTROGASTROGR; Komorowski D, 2015, IEEE ENG MED BIO, P6006, DOI 10.1109/EMBC.2015.731976; Komorowski D, 2009, IEEE ENG MED BIO, P392, DOI 10.1109/IEMBS.2009.533347; Komorowski D, 2018, ADV INTELL SYST, V623, P125, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-70063-2_1; Komorowski D, 2016, ADV INTELL SYST, V471, P311, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-39796-2_2; Komorowski D, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-015-0358-; Komorowski D, 2012, IEEE I C ELECT CIRC, P372, DOI 10.1109/ICECS.2012.646372; Lawlor PM, 2001, IRISH J MED SCI, V170, P126, DOI 10.1007/BF0316882; Levanon D, 1998, DIGEST DIS SCI, V43, P1023, DOI 10.1023/A:101883080178; Liang J, 1997, DIGEST DIS SCI, V42, P1331, DOI 10.1023/A:101886930029; Lin HH, 2007, INT J CLIN PRACT, V61, P1126, DOI 10.1111/j.1742-1241.2006.01090.; Lin XM, 2001, AM J PHYSIOL-GASTR L, V280, pG1370, DOI 10.1152/ajpgi.2001.280.6.G137; Lin Z., 2006, WILEY ENCY BIOMEDICA, DOI [10.1002/9780471740360.ebs0419, DOI 10.1002/97804; Lin Z, 2006, NEUROGASTROENT MOTIL, V18, P491, DOI [10.1111/j.1365-2982.2006.00789_37.x, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2982.2006.00789_37.X; MEDTRONICK A/S, 2002, POL NET TM REF MAN ; Mika B, 2018, COMPUT BIOL MED, V100, P305, DOI 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.12.02; O'Grady G, 2014, CLIN EXP PHARMACOL P, V41, P854, DOI 10.1111/1440-1681.1228; O'Grady G, 2010, AM J PHYSIOL-GASTR L, V299, pG585, DOI 10.1152/ajpgi.00125.201; Oppenheim A.V., 2010, PRENTICE HALL SIGNA; Owyang C, 2002, AM J PHYSIOL-GASTR L, V283, pG8, DOI 10.1152/ajpgi.00095.200; PAN J, 1985, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V32, P230, DOI 10.1109/TBME.1985.32553; Parkman Henry P, 2010, Gastroenterol Hepatol (N Y), V6, P; Parkman HP, 2003, NEUROGASTROENT MOTIL, V15, P89, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2982.2003.00396.; Paskaranandavadivel N, 2013, NEUROGASTROENT MOTIL, V25, P79, DOI 10.1111/nmo.1201; Pietraszek S, 2009, IEEE ENG MED BIO, P396, DOI 10.1109/IEMBS.2009.533345; Pietraszek S, 2010, ADV INTEL SOFT COMPU, V69, P28; Qin SJ, 2015, BIO-MED MATER ENG, V26, pS1515, DOI 10.3233/BME-15145; Ramshur J., 2010, DESIGN EVALUATION AP, DOI [10.13140/RG.2.2.33667.81444, DOI 10.13140/RG.2.2.33667.81444; Rodriguez-Linares L, 2014, COMPUT METH PROG BIO, V116, P26, DOI 10.1016/j.cmpb.2014.04.00; Schuster MM, 2002, HLTH AND DI; Tarvainen MP, 2014, COMPUT METH PROG BIO, V113, P210, DOI 10.1016/j.cmpb.2013.07.02; Wang ZS, 2003, NEUROGASTROENT MOTIL, V15, P457, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2982.2003.00430.; Yassi R, 2012, BMC GASTROENTEROL, V12, DOI 10.1186/1471-230X-12-6; Yin JY, 2013, J NEUROGASTROENTEROL, V19, P5, DOI 10.5056/jnm.2013.19.1.",48,4,4,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In the MobiGuide project, we developed an evidence-based clinical decision-support system that delivered personalized reminders and recommendations to patients, helping to achieve higher therapy compliance. Yet compliance could still be improved and therefore building on the MobiGuide project experience, we designed a new component called the Motivational Patient Assistant (MPA) that is integrated within the MobiGuide architecture to further improve compliance. This component draws from psychological theories to provide behavioral support to improve patient engagement and thereby increasing patients' compliance. Behavior modification interventions are delivered via mobile technology at patients' home environments. Our approach was inspired by the IDEAS (Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share) framework for developing effective digital interventions to change health behavior; it goes beyond this approach by extending the Ideation phase' concepts into concrete backend architectural components and graphical user-interface designs that implement behavioral interventions. We describe in detail our ideation approach and how it was applied to design the user interface of MPA for anticoagulation therapy for the atrial fibrillation patients. We report results of a preliminary evaluation involving patients and care providers that shows the potential usefulness of the MPA for improving compliance to anticoagulation therapy.","[Peleg, Mor] Univ Haifa, Haifa, Israel; [Michalowski, Wojtek; Wilk, Szymon; Parimbelli, Enea; Bonaccio, Silvia] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Wilk, Szymon] Poznan Univ Tech, Poznan, Poland; [O'Sullivan, Dympna] Natl Coll Ireland, Dublin, Ireland; [Michalowski, Martin] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Quaglini, Silvana] Univ Pavia, Pavia, Italy; [Carrier, Marc] Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Peleg, M (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Haifa, Israel.",morpeleg@is.haifa.ac.il,"Parimbelli, Enea/AAE-2140-2020; Wilk, Szymon/K-1685-2014; quaglini, silvana/AAC-2687-2022; Michalowski, Martin/AAJ-7931-2020","Wilk, Szymon/0000-0002-7807-454X; quaglini, silvana/0000-0002-4288-2561; Michalowski, Martin/0000-0003-2060-5878; O'Sullivan, Dympna/0000-0003-2841-9738; Peleg, Mor/0000-0002-5612-768X; Michalowski, Wojtek/0000-0002-9198-6439",,,"Abraham C, 2008, HEALTH PSYCHOL, V27, P379, DOI 10.1037/0278-6133.27.3.37; Abu-Dalbouh Hussain Mohammad, 2013, Journal of Computer Science, V9, P763, DOI 10.3844/jcssp.2013.763.77; [Anonymous], 1995, 10 USABILITY HEURIS; Apotex, 2008, ANT THER PERS MED R; Brown MT, 2011, MAYO CLIN PROC, V86, P304, DOI 10.4065/mcp.2010.057; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017, CHRON DIS O; Chisholm-Burns MA, 2012, J AM PHARM ASSOC, V52, P823, DOI 10.1331/JAPhA.2012.1108; Collins LM, 2005, ANN BEHAV MED, V30, P65, DOI 10.1207/s15324796abm3001_; Costa E, 2015, PATIENT PREFER ADHER, V9, DOI 10.2147/PPA.S8755; Fogg B., 2009, P 4 INT C PERSUASIV; Gladstone DJ, 2009, STROKE, V40, P235, DOI 10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.51634; Godino JG, 2016, LANCET DIABETES ENDO, V4, P747, DOI 10.1016/S2213-8587(16)30105-; Graffigna G, 2017, PLOS ONE, V12, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.017986; Greco S, 2001, EUR J OPER RES, V129, P1, DOI 10.1016/S0377-2217(00)00167-; Jin Jing, 2008, Ther Clin Risk Manag, V4, P26; Krukowski RA, 2013, HEALTH PSYCHOL, V32, P164, DOI 10.1037/a002813; Lynch W., 2014, ALTARUM I SPRING 20; Mullerova H, 2016, INT J CHRONIC OBSTR, V11, P881, DOI 10.2147/COPD.S10228; Muller S, 2015, BMC HEALTH SERV RES, V15, DOI 10.1186/s12913-015-0809-; Mummah SA, 2016, JMIR, V1; Mummah SA, 2016, INT J BEHAV NUTR PHY, V13, DOI 10.1186/s12966-016-0400-; Norcross JC, 2011, J CLIN PSYCHOL, V67, P143, DOI 10.1002/jclp.2075; Peleg M, 2017, USER MODEL USER-ADAP, V27, P159, DOI 10.1007/s11257-017-9190-; Peleg M, 2017, INT J MED INFORM, V101, P108, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.02.01; Pollak JP, 2011, 29TH ANNUAL CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS, P72; Prochaska J.O., 2016, CHANGING THRIVE USI; Ream M, 2017, J CLIN ONCOL, V35, DOI 10.1200/JCO.2017.35.31_suppl.24; Reinwand DA, 2016, BMC PUBLIC HEALTH, V16, DOI 10.1186/s12889-016-2975-; Riley WT, 2011, TRANSL BEHAV MED, V1, P53, DOI 10.1007/s13142-011-0021-; Ryan RM, 2017, SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY: BASIC PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS IN MOTIVATION, DEVELOPMENT, AND WELLNESS, P1, DOI 10.1521/978.14625/2880; Schnall R, 2016, J BIOMED INFORM, V60, P243, DOI 10.1016/j.jbi.2016.02.00; Smith KL, 2014, J MED INTERNET RES, V16, P22, DOI 10.2196/jmir.311; Viswanathan M, 2012, ANN INTERN MED, V157, P785, DOI 10.7326/0003-4819-157-11-201212040-0053; Wilk S., 2017, P INT JOINT WORKSH K, P5; Yao XX, 2016, J AM HEART ASSOC, V5, DOI 10.1161/JAHA.115.00307",35,5,5,3,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

This AD disease has less symptoms such as short term memory loss, mood swings, problem with language understanding and behavioral issues. Due to these low symptoms, AD disease is difficult to recognize in the early stage. So, the automated computer aided system need to be developed for recognizing the AD disease for minimizing the mortality rate. Initially, brain MRI image is collected from patients which are processed by applying different processing steps such as noise removal, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. The captured MRI image has noise that is eliminated by applying the Lucy-Richardson approach which examines the each pixel in the image and removes the Gaussian noise which also eliminates the blur image. After eliminating the noise pixel from the image, affected region is segmented by Prolong adaptive exclusive analytical Atlas approach. From the segmented region, different GLCM statistical features are extracted and optimal features subset is selected by applying the hybrid wrapper filtering approach. This selected features are analyzed by N-fold cross validation approach which recognizes the AD related features successfully. Then the efficiency of the system is evaluated with the help of MATLAB based experimental results, in which Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset images are utilized for examining the efficiency in terms of sensitivity, specificity, ROC curve and accuracy.","[Sampath, R.] Anna Univ, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Indumathi, J.] Anna Univ, Dept Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Engn, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India","Sampath, R (corresponding author), Anna Univ, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.",sampathrajaram14@gmail.com,"JAYARAMAN, INDUMATHI/AFQ-7588-2022","JAYARAMAN, INDUMATHI/0000-0003-4673-6710; RAJARAM, SAMPATH/0000-0001-9806-3912",,,"Aizenstein HJ, 2008, ARCH NEUROL-CHICAGO, V65, P1509, DOI 10.1001/archneur.65.11.150; Akgul C.

The MODWT is used to handle the arbitrary changes in the input signal. The R wave's detctected by the proposed framework is used by the doctors and careholders to take necessary action for the patients. MATLAB simulink model is used to develop the simulation model for the MODWT method. The performance of the MODWT based remote health monitoring system method is comparatively analyzed with other ECG monitoring approaches such as Haar Wavelet Transformation (HWT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Sensitivity, specificity, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve are calculated to evaluate the proposed Internet of Things with MODWT based ECG monitoring system. We have used MIT-BIH Arrythmia Database to perform the experiments.","[Sundarasekar, Revathi] Priyadarshini Engn Coll, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Thanjaivadivel, M.] Veltech Univ, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Manogaran, Gunasekaran; Kumar, Priyan Malarvizhi] VIT Univ, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Varatharajan, R.] Sri Ramanujar Engn Coll, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Chilamkurti, Naveen] La Trobe Univ, Bundoora, Vic, Australia; [Hsu, Ching-Hsien] Chung Hua Univ, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Kumar, PM (corresponding author), VIT Univ, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India.",priyanit085@gmail.com,"Hsu, Ching-Hsien/AAE-6917-2020; Chilamkurti, Naveen/S-9636-2019; K, PRIYAN M/U-3908-2018","K, PRIYAN M/0000-0001-6149-2705; M, THANJAIVADIVEL/0000-0002-8754-1947",,,"Abawajy JH, 2017, IEEE COMMUN MAG, V55, P48, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600374C; [Anonymous], 2018, CENTRALIZED FOG COMP, DOI DOI 10.4018/978-1-5225-2947-7.CH01; Atzori L, 2010, COMPUT NETW, V54, P2787, DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2010.05.01; Baumer U., 2017, PALGRAVE HDB MANAGIN, P43; Blumenstock J., 2010, C P 4 ACMIEEE INT C, DOI [10.1145/2369220.2369225, DOI 10.1145/2369220.2369225; Chakravorty R, 2006, PERV COMP COMM WORK; Cheng JJ, 2015, IEEE T INTELL TRANSP, V16, P2339, DOI 10.1109/TITS.2015.242366; D'Angelo G., 2016, SIMULATION MODELLIN; Dimitrakopoulos G., 2011, 2011 11th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications (ITST), P145, DOI 10.1109/ITST.2011.606004; Gerla M, 2014, 2014 IEEE WORLD FORUM ON INTERNET OF THINGS (WF-IOT), P241, DOI 10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.680316; Gubbi J, 2013, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V29, P1645, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2013.01.01; Ho G, 2016, ASIA CCS'16: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 11TH ACM ASIA CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND COMMUNICATIONS SECURITY, P461, DOI 10.1145/2897845.289788; Kumar P, 2012, SENSORS-BASEL, V12, P55, DOI 10.3390/s12010005; Li X, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V84, P149, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2017.08.02; Li X, 2018, J NETW COMPUT APPL, V103, P194, DOI 10.1016/j.jnca.2017.07.00; Lin ATY, 2016, INT MICRO PACK ASS, P209, DOI 10.1109/IMPACT.2016.780002; Lopez D, 2016, INT J INFECT DIS, V45, P23, DOI 10.1016/j.ijid.2016.02.08; Lopez D., 2017, BIOMEDICAL RE; Lopez D, 2015, ADV INTELL SYST, V415, P195, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-27212-2_1; Lopez Daphne, 2014, Proc IEEE Int Conf Big Data, V2014, P19, DOI 10.1109/BigData.2014.700442; Lorincz K, 2004, IEEE PERVAS COMPUT, V3, P16, DOI 10.1109/MPRV.2004.1; Malan D., 2004, INT WORKSH WEAR IMPL, V; Manogaran G., ADV HUMAN SOCIAL ASP, V2022, P2; Manogaran G., 2017, COMPUTERS ELECT EN; Manogaran G., 2017, INNOVATIVE HEALTHCAR, P263, DOI [DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-55774-8_10, 10.1007/978-3-319-55774-8_10; Manogaran G, 2018, CLUSTER COMPUT, V21, P189, DOI 10.1007/s10586-017-0982-; Manogaran G, 2017, SPRINGER SER ADV MAN, P103, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-50660-9_; Manogaran G, 2017, STUD BIG DATA, V23, P133, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-49736-5_; Manogaran G, 2017, INT J AMBIENT COMPUT, V8, P88, DOI 10.4018/IJACI.201704010; Manogaran G, 2016, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V87, P128, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2016.05.13; Mieronkoski R., 2017, INT J NURSING STUDI; Mulani T.

In this paper, we explore the role of patient accessible electronic health records (PAEHRs) with respect to this increase in patient involvement. The study was performed as a case study and included nine interviews with patients and a survey that was responded to by 56 patients. Our results show that PAEHRs have a role in the enhancement of patient involvement because PAEHRs (i) foster a more balanced relationship between patients and healthcare professionals and (ii) increase access to information.","[Wass, Sofie; Vimarlund, Vivian] Jonkoping Univ, Int Business Sch, POB 1026, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden; [Vimarlund, Vivian] Linkoping Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Human Ctr Syst, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden","Wass, S (corresponding author), Jonkoping Univ, Int Business Sch, POB 1026, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden.",sofie.wass@ju.se,,"Wass, Sofie/0000-0003-3052-6014",Swedish Research School of Management and IT (MIT),This research was partially supported by The Swedish Research School of Management and IT (MIT).,"Adler-Milstein J, 2017, J AM MED INFORM ASSN, V24, P1036, DOI 10.1093/jamia/ocx01; Ammenwerth E, 2012, J MED INTERNET RES, V14, P325, DOI 10.2196/jmir.223; [Anonymous], 2013, ANN BUDGET OPERATIO; Beard L, 2012, J AM MED INFORM ASSN, V19, P116, DOI 10.1136/amiajnl-2011-00026; Cahill J, 1998, J CLIN NURS, V7, P119, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2702.1998.00132.; Delbanco T, 2012, ANN INTERN MED, V157, P461, DOI 10.7326/0003-4819-157-7-201210020-0000; Erlingsdottir G, 2015, SCAND J PUBLIC ADM, V19, P2; Esch T, 2016, BMJ OPEN, V6, DOI 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-01003; European Commission, 2012, PAT IN; Graneheim UH, 2004, NURS EDUC TODAY, V24, P105, DOI 10.1016/j.nedt.2003.10.00; Hoerbst A, 2010, INT J MED INFORM, V79, P81, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2009.11.00; Inera, 2015, ARCH INF; Inera, 2016, EL HLTH RE; Jilka SR, 2015, J MED INTERNET RES, V17, DOI 10.2196/jmir.444; Longtin Y, 2010, MAYO CLIN PROC, V85, P53, DOI 10.4065/mcp.2009.024; Rexhepi H, 2018, HEALTH INFORM J, V24, P115, DOI 10.1177/146045821665877; Roberts K, 2017, J AM MED INFORM ASSN, V24, pE185, DOI 10.1093/jamia/ocw10; Snyder H, 2016, INT J NURS STUD, V53, P351, DOI 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2015.09.00; Vodicka E, 2013, J MED INTERNET RES, V15, P186, DOI 10.2196/jmir.267; Woods SS, 2013, J MED INTERNET RES, V15, P182, DOI 10.2196/jmir.235; Wright E, 2015, J MED INTERNET RES, V17, DOI 10.2196/jmir.487",21,6,6,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Residents care for patients under the supervision of the attending physician, whereas scribes assist physicians with documentation contemporaneously with the patient encounter. Optimal allocation of these roles to shifts is crucial to improve patient care, physician productivity, and to increase learning opportunities for residents. Since resident and scribe availability varies on a monthly basis, the allocation of these roles into different shifts within a pre-designed ED physician shift template must be dynamically adjusted. Using historical patient flow timestamp data as well as information about the patient-coverage capacity of an ED care team, a data-driven model was developed for optimally determining which shifts must be staffed by residents and scribes to maximize patient coverage and to calculate the relative importance of a shift. This relative importance metric aids decision-making in adjusting the allocation of residents and scribes to various shifts as their availability fluctuates. Since the model uses historical timestamp data, which all EDs are mandated to collect, the approach is generalizable to all EDs.","[Wutthisirisart, Phichet; Pasupathy, Kalyan; Sir, Mustafa Y.] Mayo Clin, Dept Hlth Sci Res, Kern Ctr Sci Hlth Care Delivery, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Martinez, Gabriela] Siemens Healthineers, Manhasset, NY USA; [Heaton, Heather A.] Mayo Clin, Dept Emergency Med, Rochester, MN USA; [Thompson, Moriah S.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Aerosp Med, Galveston, TX 77555 USA","Sir, MY (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Dept Hlth Sci Res, Kern Ctr Sci Hlth Care Delivery, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.",sir.mustafa@mayo.edu,,"Martinez, Maria/0000-0003-4919-0733",Mayo Clinic Robert D. and Patricia E.

The primary tasks of EEG signal analysis is to identify the noisy signal as well as enormous data that create signal processing and subsequent analysis. Beforehand any analysis of the EEG signal, the obtained raw signal must be preprocessed for eliminating undesirable artifacts as well as horrible noise. With the aim of resolving this issue, in this research, raw signals are preprocessed with the help of Band-Pass Filter (BPF) for noise removal method. Instead, in adaptive Sliding Window with Fuzzy C Means Clustering (SW-FCM) segmentation is presented, which precisely as well as automatically segments the signals. So as to analyze the accuracy, five features such as electroencephalography alpha spectrum, frequency of the main peak, Amplitude of the main peak, Higher Order Crossing (HOC), and wavelet features are used as the evaluating variables. Lastly to assess the meditation experience with Fuzzy Kernel least square Support Vector Machine (FKLSSVM) classifier, the presented method with a cross-sectional analysis is utilized. These two classifiers are utilized for meditation experience classification by utilizing an individual feature vector values from equivalent EEG signals. The dataset samples are gathered from Open source Brain-Computer Interface (Open BCI) platform. Outcomes attained are matched up for diverse techniques for identifying as well as for classifying signal segments features using MATLAB. Presented classifiers of the meditation process validate quick interpretation methods that differentiate meditation experience and valuable performance related to artificial approaches for the big-data analysis.","[Devipriya, A.] Sri Krishna Coll Engn & Technol, Informat Technol, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Nagarajan, N.] Coimbatore Inst Engn & Technol, Narasipuram, India","Devipriya, A (corresponding author), Sri Krishna Coll Engn & Technol, Informat Technol, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.",adevipriya@skcet.ac.in; swekalnag@gmail.com,,,,,"Abdel-Basset M., 2018, DESIGN AUTOMATION EM, P; Abdel-Basset M, 2018, NEURAL COMPUT APPL, V29, P345, DOI 10.1007/s00521-016-2464-; Abdel-Basset M, 2019, CONCURR COMP-PRACT E, V31, DOI 10.1002/cpe.451; Abdel-Basset M, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V86, P614, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.04.05; Abdel-Basset M, 2020, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V79, P5419, DOI 10.1007/s11042-018-6266-; Abdel-Basset M, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V85, P129, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.03.02; Abdelrahman MA, 2018, 2018 53RD INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITIES POWER ENGINEERING CONFERENCE (UPEC; Ackermann P., 2016, IEEE INT C E HLTH NE, P1, DOI 10.1109/ HealthCom.2016.774944; Aftanas L, 2005, INT J NEUROSCI, V115, P893, DOI 10.1080/0020745059089796; Ahani A, 2013, I IEEE EMBS C NEUR E, P1378, DOI 10.1109/NER.2013.669619; Bontempo K, 2011, INTERPRETING, V13, P85, DOI 10.1075/intp.13.1.06bo; Brandmeyer T., 2016, EXP BRAIN RES, P; Brandmeyer T, 2013, FRONT PSYCHOL, V4, DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2013.0068; Brett CE, 2012, QUAL LIFE RES, V21, P505, DOI 10.1007/s11136-011-9951-; Broderick P, 2005, COGNITIVE THER RES, V29, P501, DOI 10.1007/s10608-005-3888-; Chang KM, 2005, BIOMED ENG-APP BAS C, V17, P167, DOI 10.4015/S101623720500026; Chuang KS, 2006, COMPUT MED IMAG GRAP, V30, P9, DOI 10.1016/j.compmedimag.2005.10.00; Daubechies I, 1998, J FOURIER ANAL APPL, V4, P247, DOI 10.1007/BF0247602; Goyal M, 2014, JAMA INTERN MED, V174, P357, DOI 10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.1301; Hagari H, 2006, U.

Earlier identification of patients who are at higher risk for PVL may improve clinicians' ability to optimize care for these challenging patients. The aim of this study was to apply machine learning algorithms and wavelet analysis to vital sign and laboratory data obtained from neonates immediately after cardiac surgery to predict PVL occurrence. We analyzed physiological data of patients with and without hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) during the first 12 h after cardiac surgery. Wavelet transform was applied to extract time-frequency information from the data. We ranked the extracted features to select the most discriminative features, and the support vector machine with radial basis function as a kernel was selected as the classifier. The classifier was optimized via three methods: (1) mutual information, (2) modified mutual information considering the reliability of features, and (3) modified mutual information with reliability index and maximizing set's mutual information. We assessed the accuracy of the classifier at each time point. A total of 71 neonates met the study criteria. The rates of PVL occurrence were 33% for all patients, with 41% in the HLHS group and 25% in the non-HLHS group. The F-score results for HLHS patients and non-HLHS patients were 0.88 and 1.00, respectively. Using maximizing set's mutual information improved the classifier performance in the all patient groups from 0.69 to 0.81. The novel application of a modified mutual information ranking system with the reliability index in a PVL prediction model provided highly accurate identification. This tool is a promising step for improving the care of neonates who are at higher risk for developing PVL following cardiac surgery.","[Jalali, Ali] Johns Hopkins All Childrens Hosp, Dept Hlth Informat, 501 6th Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Simpao, Allan F.; Galvez, Jorge A.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care, 3401 Civ Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Simpao, Allan F.; Galvez, Jorge A.; Licht, Daniel J.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, 3401 Civ Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Licht, Daniel J.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Dept Pediat, 3401 Civ Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Nataraj, Chandrasekhar] Villanova Univ, Villanova Ctr Analyt Dynam Syst, Dept Mech Engn, Villanova, PA 19085 USA","Jalali, A (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins All Childrens Hosp, Dept Hlth Informat, 501 6th Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.",jalali@jhmi.edu,"Gálvez, Jorge/U-3448-2018; Simpao, Allan F./V-6946-2018; Licht, Daniel/I-3370-2013","Gálvez, Jorge/0000-0001-7145-4921; Simpao, Allan F./0000-0001-8871-2579; Licht, Daniel/0000-0002-4080-843X",National Institutes of Health [1 R01 NS 72338 01A1],The research reported in this paper was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (No. 1 R01 NS 72338 01A1).,"Acharya UR, 2006, MED BIOL ENG COMPUT, V44, P1031, DOI 10.1007/s11517-006-0119-; Alanazi HO, 2017, J MED SYST, V41, DOI 10.1007/s10916-017-0715-; Beca J, 2013, CIRCULATION, V127, P971, DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.00108; Bozhokin SV, 2012, TECH PHYS+, V57, P900, DOI 10.1134/S106378421207006; Galli KK, 2004, J THORAC CARDIOV SUR, V127, P692, DOI 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2003.09.05; Ghorbanian P, 2013, ANN BIOMED ENG, V41, P1243, DOI 10.1007/s10439-013-0795-; Herold J, 2005, MED BIOL ENG COMPUT, V43, P451, DOI 10.1007/BF0234472; Hwa R.

This will have a major influence on both the patient and the society as it can normally influence the humans in their gainful years. An early DR detection is quite challenging as it may not be detected by humans. There are several techniques and algorithms that have been established for detecting the DR. These techniques have been facing problems to achieve effective sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity. In order to overcome all these problems, the work has proposed one more such effective algorithm for image processing in order to increase the efficiency and also identify easily the DR diseases. A major challenge in the task is the automatic detection of the microaneurysms. In this work, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) parameters optimized with Glowworm Swarm Optimization (GSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to classify the DR. Because the SVM parameter C and to control the performance of the classifier. For this work, the SVMs get fused with the hybrid GSO-GA along with the feature chromosomes that are generated that will thereby direct the GA search to a straight line of the error of optimal generalization in their super parameter space. This GSO algorithm will not have memory and the glow worms will not retain any information in memory. The results of the experiment prove that this method had achieved a better performance.","[Karthikeyan, R.] PSNA Coll Engn & Technol, Dept CSE, Dindigul, Tamil Nadu, India; [Alli, P.] Velammal Coll Engn & Technol, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India","Karthikeyan, R (corresponding author), PSNA Coll Engn & Technol, Dept CSE, Dindigul, Tamil Nadu, India.",rkarthikeyan.csc@gmail.com; alli_rajus@yahoo.com,"P, Alli/AFJ-7184-2022; R, Karthikeyan/AAR-8093-2020","P, Alli/0000-0001-6131-6250; R, Karthikeyan/0000-0003-1264-5554",,,"Acharya UR, 2009, P I MECH ENG H, V223, P545, DOI 10.1243/09544119JEIM48; Asad AH, 2014, RECENT ADV INTELLIGE, V235, P1, DOI [10.1007/978-3-319-01778-5_1, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-01778-5_1; Balakrishnan U, 2016, J INNOV OPT HEAL SCI, V9, DOI 10.1142/S179354581650020; Das V, 2017, J MED IMAGING, V4, DOI 10.1117/1.JMI.4.2.02400; Faust O, 2012, J MED SYST, V36, P145, DOI 10.1007/s10916-010-9454-; Gharaibeh NY., 2016, J POWER ENERGY ENG, V10, P47; Gharaibeh NY, 2016, COMPUT INF SCI, V10, P; Gujral S., 2017, INT J INNOV RES SCI, V3, P5; Huang CL, 2006, EXPERT SYST APPL, V31, P231, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2005.09.02; KAUR A, 2016, INT J CURRENT ENG TE, V46, P14; Krishnanand K.

Tomographic reconstruction in 3D is different from camera based scene reconstruction which has been achieved using various techniques including minimal surfaces, level sets, snakes, graph cuts, silhouettes, multi-scale approach, patchwork etc. In tomography limitations of image aquisition method i-e CT Scan, X Rays and MRI as well as non availability of camera parameters for calibration restrict the quality of final reconstruction.

We propose a fully-reconfigurable architecture that addresses the major challenges of a heterogenous BSN, such as scalabiliy, modularity and flexibility in deployment. Existing BSNs especially with Electroencephalogarm (EEG) have these limitations mainly due to the use of driven-right-leg (DRL) circuit. We address these limitations by custom-designing DRL-less EEG smart sensing nodes (SSN) for modular and spatially distributed systems. Each single-channel EEG SSN with a input-referred noise of 0.82 V-rms and CMRR of 70dB (at 60Hz), samples brain signals at 512 sps. SSNs in the network can be configured at the time of deployment and can process information locally to significantly reduce data payload of the network. A Control Command Node (CCN) initializes, synchronizes, periodically scans for the available SSNs in the network, aggregates their data and sends it wirelessly to a paired device at a baud rate of 115.2kbps. At the given settings of the (IC)-C-2 bus speed of 100kbps, CCN can configure up to 39 EEG SSNs in a lego-like platform. The temporal and frequency-domain performance of the designed DRL-less EEG SSNs is evaluated against a research-grade Neuroscan and consumer-grade Emotiv EPOC EEG. The results show that the proposed network system with wearable EEG can be deployed in situ for continuous brain signal recording in real-life scenarios. The proposed system can also seamlessly incorporate other physiological SSNs for ECG, HRV, temperature etc. along with EEG within the same topology.","[Mahajan, Ruhi] Univ Tennessee, Hlth Sci Ctr, Ctr Biomed Informat, Memphis, TN 38163 USA; [Morshed, Bashir I.] Univ Memphis, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; [Bidelman, Gavin M.] Univ Memphis, Sch Commun Sci & Disorders, Memphis, TN 38152 USA","Mahajan, R (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Hlth Sci Ctr, Ctr Biomed Informat, Memphis, TN 38163 USA.",er.ruhimahajan@gmail.com,"Bidelman, Gavin M/D-9998-2016","Bidelman, Gavin M/0000-0002-1821-3261","FedEx Institute of Technology Innovation Grant, The University of Memphis, TN [2013-537908] Funding Source: Medline",,"Anliker U, 2004, IEEE T INF TECHNOL B, V8, P415, DOI 10.1109/TITB.2004.83788; Chen H, 2010, J MED SYST, V34, P303, DOI 10.1007/s10916-008-9242-; Chi YM, 2009, SIXTH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON WEARABLE AND IMPLANTABLE BODY SENSOR NETWORKS, PROCEEDINGS, P246, DOI [10.1109/BSN.2009.52, 10.1109/P3644.51; CHOUDHURY T, 2008, IEEE PERVASIVE MAGA; Compumedics Lim, SYNAMPS RT DET OV F; DeVaul R, 2003, SEVENTH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON WEARABLE COMPUTERS, PROCEEDINGS, P4, DOI 10.1109/ISWC.2003.124138; Farshchi S, 2007, IEEE T INF TECHNOL B, V11, P611, DOI 10.1109/TITB.2007.89760; Farshchi S, 2006, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V53, P1416, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2006.87376; Gama Oscar, 2007, 2007 International Conference on Sensor Technologies and Applications - SensorComm 2007, P490, DOI 10.1109/SENSORCOMM.2007.439496; Ganti R.

But recently, this disease has been witnessed in other regions to a large extent and can become an epidemic very soon. In this paper, a new fog computing based e-Healthcare framework has been proposed to monitor the KFD infected patients in an early phase of infection and control the disease outbreak. For ensuring high prediction rate, a novel Extremal Optimization tuned Neural Network (EO-NN) classification algorithm has been developed using hybridization of the extremal optimization with the feed-forward neural network. Additionally, a location based alert system has also been suggested to provide the global positioning system (GPS)-based location information of each KFD infected user and the risk-prone zones as early as possible to prevent the outbreak. Furthermore, a comparative study of proposed EO-NN with state of art classification algorithms has been carried out and it can be concluded that EO-NN outperforms others with an average accuracy of 91.56%, a sensitivity of 91.53% and a specificity of 97.13% respectively in classification and accurate identification of risk-prone areas.","[Majumdar, Abhishek; Baishnab, Krishna Lal] Natl Inst Technol Silchar, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Silchar, India; [Debnath, Tapas] Natl Inst Technol Silchar, Dept Mech Engn, Silchar, India; [Sood, Sandeep K.] Guru Nanak Dev Univ, Reg Campus, Gurdaspur, India","Majumdar, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol Silchar, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Silchar, India.",abhishek.nits@ieee.org,"Majumdar, Abhishek/A-6614-2019; Debnath, Tapas/O-8825-2018","Debnath, Tapas/0000-0003-1520-4818; Majumdar, Abhishek/0000-0003-0503-2821; K.

In this article, a notation proposal for flowcharts that partially avoids these problems is presented. This new notation is an adaptation of BPMNE2, an extension of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), which allows direct modelling of procedures that follow the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) model. The new notation has been validated in the hospital context, specifically in the field of hazardous drugs (HDs). To measure usability from the perspective of the health staff and auditors, the System Usability Scale (SUS) was used. A total of 47 experts took part in the assessment, resulting in a SUS score of 71, that corresponds to an acceptable level of usability. The feedback provided by these participants allows us to discover benefits and drawbacks of the proposal. Also, it is noteworthy that 76.6% of professionals prefer to migrate to the new notation from the ISO 5807:1985 notation, the most commonly used model. In addition to the direct benefits of this notation from the human point of view, its machine-understandable nature provides the required support for its integration into software tools for intelligent monitoring and auditing.","[Ramos-Merino, Mateo; Alvarez-Sabucedo, Luis M.; Santos-Gago, Juan M.] Univ Vigo, Escola Enxenaria Telecomunicac, Campus Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36310, Galicia, Spain; [Sanz-Valero, Javier] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Salud Publ Hist Ciencia & Ginecol, Campus St Joan, Alicante 03550, Spain","Ramos-Merino, M (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Escola Enxenaria Telecomunicac, Campus Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36310, Galicia, Spain.",mateo.ramos@gist.uvigo.es,"Gago, Juan Manuel Santos/ABG-9718-2020; Ramos Merino, Mateo/D-3749-2018","Gago, Juan Manuel Santos/0000-0002-2930-4249; Ramos Merino, Mateo/0000-0003-2460-0441; Alvarez Sabucedo, Luis/0000-0002-5834-7045",Instituto de Salud Carlos III [PI16/00788],This work has been partially funded by Instituto de Salud Carlos III through the PI16/00788 project (Quality control and traceability of biohazardous medicinal products (BPM) through the Hospital at Home using Big Data models applied to risk analysis).,"Alonso-Roris V.

Several factors support this process. Advances in omics allows individualization of diagnosis and treatment. Patient awareness and easy availability of data on the Internet allows patients to become informed decision makers when it comes even to disease management. Mass media emphasize the issue of medical errors, making patients demanding for quality in medical care. In some healthcare settings, patents face a problem of interpreting medical data and making decisions on treatment tactics without having a doctor, who could potentially support them. Delegating this task to a Patient Decision Aide system can add automatically generated recommendations to result reports without adding significant workload on the doctors, increase patients' motivation and support their decisions. We have implemented a patient decision aid system based on the productions rules, which: Collects data from available sources; Automatically analyses and interprets laboratory test results; Recommends running additional tests for a more precise diagnostic; Delivers automatically generated reports to doctors and patients in a natural language. To achieve semantic interoperability with other systems we have implemented a FHIR engine. The knowledge base has been organized as a graph structure. The application is structured as a set of lightly coupled services, which implement the logic of the decision support system. In total, we have modelled 365 nodes of test components, 5084 nodes of inference rules, 49932 connections and 3072 blocks of text for medical certificates. The findings of the research provide a deep understanding of how the semantically interoperable clinical decision support systems are implemented. Advances in notification the patients with the elements of patient decision aid is important for clinical data management, and for patients' empowerment and protection.

Medulloblastoma is that subtype of brain tumour which occurs most frequently amongst children. Post-operation, the classification of its subtype is most vital for further clinical management. In this paper a novel approach of pathological subtype classification using biological interpretable and computer-aided textural features is forwarded. The classifier for accurate features prediction is built purely on the feature set obtained by segmentation of the ground truth cells from the original histological tissue images, marked by an experienced pathologist. The work is divided into five stages: marking of ground truth, segmentation of ground truth images, feature extraction, feature reduction and finally classification. Kmeans colour segmentation is used to segment out the ground truth cells from histological images. For feature extraction we used morphological, colour and textural features of the cells followed by feature reduction using Principal Component Analysis. Finally both binary and multiclass classification is done using Support Vector Method (SVM). The classification was compared using six different classifiers and performance was evaluated employing five-fold cross-validation technique. The accuracy achieved for binary and multiclass classification before applying PCA were 95.4 and 62.1% and after applying PCA were 100 and 84.9% respectively. The run-time analysis are also shown. Results reveal that this technique of cell level classification can be successfully adopted as architectural view can be confusing. Moreover it conforms substantially to the pathologist's point of view regarding morphological and colour features, with the addition of computer assisted texture feature.","[Das, Daisy; Mahanta, Lipi B.] Inst Adv Study Sci & Technol, Ctr Computat & Numer Studies, Gauhati 781035, India; [Ahmed, Shabnam] Guwahati Neurol Res Ctr, Dept Pathol, Gauhati 781006, India; [Baishya, Basanta Kr.; Haque, Inamul] Guwahati Med Coll & Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Gauhati 781032, India","Mahanta, LB (corresponding author), Inst Adv Study Sci & Technol, Ctr Computat & Numer Studies, Gauhati 781035, India.",lbmahanta@iasst.gov.in,"Mahanta, Lipi B/R-6375-2019","Mahanta, Lipi B/0000-0002-7733-5461",,,"ARSENI C, 1981, ACTA NEUROCHIR, V57, P159, DOI 10.1007/BF0166483; Banerjee S, 2017, J MED SYST, V41, DOI 10.1007/s10916-017-0792-; COVER TM, 1967, IEEE T INFORM THEORY, V13, P21, DOI 10.1109/TIT.1967.105396; Cruz-Roa A, 2015, PROC SPIE, V9681, DOI 10.1117/12.220882; Dobson A.

Therefore, it is difficult to construct a summarized EMR for one patient from multiple hospital databases due to the security and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, current EMRs systems lack a standard data management and sharing policy, making it difficult for pharmaceutical scientists to develop precise medicines based on data obtained under different policies. To solve the above problems, we proposed a blockchain-based information management system, MedBlock, to handle patients' information. In this scheme, the distributed ledger of MedBlock allows the efficient EMRs access and EMRs retrieval. The improved consensus mechanism achieves consensus of EMRs without large energy consumption and network congestion. In addition, MedBlock also exhibits high information security combining the customized access control protocols and symmetric cryptography. MedBlock can play an important role in the sensitive medical information sharing.","[Fan, Kai; Wang, Shangyang; Ren, Yanhui; Li, Hui] Xidian Univ, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yintang] Xidian Univ, Minist Educ Wide Band Gap Semicon Mat & Devices, Key Lab, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Fan, K (corresponding author), Xidian Univ, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",kfan@mail.xidian.edu.cn,"Li, Hui/ABB-6752-2020","Li, Hui/0000-0001-8310-7169; Fan, Kai/0000-0001-6870-6657","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0802300]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61772403, U1401251]; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China [2017JM6004]; National 111 Program of China [B16037, B08038]","This study was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2017YFB0802300), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61772403 and No. U1401251), Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China (No. 2017JM6004), and National 111 Program of China B16037 and B08038.","Esposito C, 2018, IEEE CLOUD COMPUT, V5, P3; Fan K, 2018, IET COMMUN, V12, P527, DOI 10.1049/iet-com.2017.061; Ferdous S.

This paper proposes a new and simple system for microcalcification detection to assist in early breast cancer detection. This work uses the two most recognized public mammogram databases, MIAS and DDSM. We are introducing a MC detection method based on (1) Beucher gradient for detection of regions of interest (ROIs), (2) an annulus model for extraction of few and effective features from candidates to MCs, and (3) one classification stage with two different classifiers, k Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). For dense mammograms in the MIAS database, the performance metrics achieved are sensitivity of 0.9835, false alarm rate of 0.0083, accuracy of 0.9835, and area under the ROC curve of 0.9980 with a KNN classifier. The proposed MC detection method, based on a KNN classifier, achieves, a sensitivity, false positive rate, accuracy and area under the ROC curve of 0.9813, 0.0224, 0.9795 and 0.9974 for the MIAS database; and 0.9035, 0.0439, 0.9298 and 0.9759 for the DDSM database. By slightly reducing the true positive rate the method achieves three instances with false positive rate of 0: 2 on fatty mammograms with KNN and SVM, and one on dense with SVM. The proposed method gives better results than those from state of the art literature, when the mammograms are classified in fatty, fatty-glandular, and dense.","[Hernandez-Capistran, Jonathan; Martinez-Carballido, Jorge F.] Inst Nacl Astrofis Opt & Electr, Luis Enrique Erro 1, Puebla 72840, Pue, Mexico; [Rosas-Romero, Roberto] Univ Americas Puebla, Cholula, Mexico","Hernandez-Capistran, J (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Astrofis Opt & Electr, Luis Enrique Erro 1, Puebla 72840, Pue, Mexico.",jhcapistran@gmail.com; jmc@inaoep.mx; roberto.rosas@udlap.mx,"Rosas-Romero, Roberto/K-1532-2013","Rosas-Romero, Roberto/0000-0001-6118-3347; Hernandez Capistran, Jonathan/0000-0002-4689-5343",Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) [414681],"DDSM images are a courtesy of TM Desermo, Dept. of Medical Informatics, RWTH Aachen, Germany.

Heterogeneity in the healthcare sector in the form of medical data is also considered to be one of the biggest challenges for researchers. Sometimes, this data is referred to as large-scale data or big data. Blockchain technology and the Cloud environment have proved their usability separately. Though these two technologies can be combined to enhance the exciting applications in healthcare industry. Blockchain is a highly secure and decentralized networking platform of multiple computers called nodes. It is changing the way medical information is being stored and shared. It makes the work easier, keeps an eye on the security and accuracy of the data and also reduces the cost of maintenance.

Security and privacy preservation is necessary for medical data of the patient in TMIS because of the very perceptive purpose. Recently, Mohit et al.'s proposed a mutual authentication protocol for TMIS in the cloud computing environment. In this work, we reviewed their protocol and found that it is not secure against stolen verifier attack, many logged in patient attack, patient anonymity, impersonation attack, and fails to protect session key. For enhancement of security level, we proposed a new mutual authentication protocol for the similar environment. The presented framework is also more capable in terms of computation cost. In addition, the security evaluation of the protocol protects resilience of all possible security attributes, and we also explored formal security evaluation based on random oracle model. The performance of the proposed protocol is much better in comparison to the existing protocol.","[Kumar, Vinod; Ahmad, Musheer] Jamia Millia Islamia, Dept Appl Sci & Humanities, Fac Engn & Technol, New Delhi 110025, India; [Jangirala, Srinivas] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Math, Khargpur 721302, India","Jangirala, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Math, Khargpur 721302, India.",vinod.iitkgp13@gmail.com; jangiralasrinivas@maths.iitkgp.ernet.in; mahmad@jmi.ac.in,"Kumar, Vinod/ABA-3070-2021","Kumar, Vinod/0000-0002-2939-1100; Srinivas, Jangirala/0000-0002-6884-7959",,,"Abdalla M, 2008, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V5339, P133, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-89641-8_1; Abor PA, 2012, ANN C INN BUS MAN LO, P2; Amin Ruhul, 2016, International Journal of Network Security, V18, P17; Amin R, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V80, P483, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2016.05.03; Amin R, 2015, J MED SYST, V39, DOI 10.1007/s10916-015-0318-; Amin R, 2015, ARAB J SCI ENG, V40, P3135, DOI 10.1007/s13369-015-1743-; [Anonymous], 2012, P 27 ANN ACM S APPL, DOI DOI 10.1145/2245276.223200; [Anonymous], 2013, INT C NETW SYST SE; Bajpai D., 2012, ADV COMPUTING INFORM, V176, P719, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-31513-8_7; Bresson E., 2003, P 10 ACM CCS 2003, P241, DOI DOI 10.1145/948109.94814; Cao BQ, 2009, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V5931, P64; Casalicchio E, 2013, COMPUT NETW, V57, P795, DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2012.10.02; Chaudhry SA, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0592-; Chaudhry SA, 2015, J MED SYST, V39, DOI 10.1007/s10916-015-0244-; Chen CL, 2014, J MED SYST, V38, DOI 10.1007/s10916-014-0112-; Chiou SY, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0453-; Giri D, 2015, J MED SYST, V39, DOI 10.1007/s10916-014-0145-; Gope P, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0620-; Hankerson D., 2006, GUIDE ELLIPTIC CURV; He D, 2016, IEEE T DEPENDABLE S; He DB, 2017, IEEE SYST J, V11, P2590, DOI 10.1109/JSYST.2016.254480; He DB, 2016, SCI CHINA INFORM SCI, V59, DOI 10.1007/s11432-015-5469-; He DB, 2015, MULTIMEDIA SYST, V21, P49, DOI 10.1007/s00530-013-0346-; He DB, 2015, IEEE SYST J, V9, P816, DOI 10.1109/JSYST.2014.230151; He DB, 2012, J MED SYST, V36, P1989, DOI 10.1007/s10916-011-9658-; Huang SY, 2011, 2011 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INSTRUMENTATION, MEASUREMENT, CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS (ICIMCS 2011), VOL 3: COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN, MANUFACTURING AND MANAGEMENT, P1, DOI 10.1109/M2RSM.2011.569740; Islam SKH, 2017, J KING SAUD UNIV-COM, V29, P311, DOI 10.1016/j.jksuci.2015.08.00; Islam SKH, 2016, INT J COMMUN SYST, V29, P1529, DOI 10.1002/dac.312; Jiang Q, 2013, J MED SYST, V37, DOI 10.1007/s10916-012-9897-; Karati A, 2016, ARAB J SCI ENG, V41, P3201, DOI 10.1007/s13369-016-2156-; Kumari S, 2013, J MED SYST, V37, DOI 10.1007/s10916-013-9952-; Lee CC, 2013, J MED SYST, V37, DOI 10.1007/s10916-013-9973-; Li CT, 2014, J MED SYST, V38, DOI 10.1007/s10916-014-0077-; Li X, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0629-; Li X, 2013, J NETW COMPUT APPL, V36, P1365, DOI 10.1016/j.jnca.2013.02.03; Liu XX, 2017, KSII T INTERNET INF, V11, P924, DOI 10.3837/tiis.2017.02.01; Liu Y., 2018, SYSTEMS MAN CYBERN ; Liu YN, 2016, KSII T INTERNET INF, V10, P3852, DOI 10.3837/tiis.2016.08.02; Maitra T, 2017, INT J COMMUN SYST, V30, DOI 10.1002/dac.324; Menezes A.J., 1996, HDB APPL CRYPTOGRAP; Mishra D, 2014, J MED SYST, V38, DOI [10.1007/s10916-014-0024-2, 10.1007/s10916-014-0120-3; Mohit P, 2017, J MED SYST, V41, DOI 10.1007/s10916-017-0699-; Ramez WS., 2012, INT J BUSINESS SOCIA, V; Srinivas J., 2018, IEEE T DEPENDABLE S; Srinivas J, 2017, J MED SYST, V41, DOI 10.1007/s10916-017-0720-; Sureshkumar V, 2017, COMPUT ELECTR ENG, V57, P223, DOI 10.1016/j.compeleceng.2016.07.01; Sutrala AK, 2016, COMPUT METH PROG BIO, V135, P167, DOI 10.1016/j.cmpb.2016.07.02; Tsai Y.

Meanwhile, we are entering a new period where novel technologies are starting to analyze and explore knowledge from tremendous amount of data, bringing limitless potential for information growth. One fact that cannot be ignored is that the techniques of machine learning and deep learning applications play a more significant role in the success of bioinformatics exploration from biological data point of view, and a linkage is emphasized and established to bridge these two data analytics techniques and bioinformatics in both industry and academia. This survey concentrates on the review of recent researches using data mining and deep learning approaches for analyzing the specific domain knowledge of bioinformatics. The authors give a brief but pithy summarization of numerous data mining algorithms used for preprocessing, classification and clustering as well as various optimized neural network architectures in deep learning methods, and their advantages and disadvantages in the practical applications are also discussed and compared in terms of their industrial usage. It is believed that in this review paper, valuable insights are provided for those who are dedicated to start using data analytics methods in bioinformatics.","[Lan, Kun; Fong, Simon] Univ Macau, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China; [Wang, Dan-tong] Dept Media Integrat Technol Ctr, Zhejiang Radio & TV Grp, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Liu, Lian-sheng] Guangzhou Univ TCM, Affiliated Hosp 1, Guangzhou 510405, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wong, Kelvin K.

As a consequence, obtaining the valuable medical data with minimal cost and impacts on hospital work comes as the first concern of researchers. Anesthesia plays a widely recognized role in surgeries, which attracts people to undertake relevant research. In this paper, a real-time physiological medical signal data acquisition system (PMSDA) for the multi-operating room applications is proposed with high universality of the hospital practical settings and research requirements. By utilizing a wireless communication approach, it provides an easily accessible network platform for collection of physiological medical signals such as photoplethysmogram (PPG), electrocardiograph (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) during the surgery. In addition, the raw data is stored on a server for safe backup and further analysis of depth of anesthesia (DoA). Results show that the PMSDA exhibits robust, high quality performance and efficiently reduces costs compared to previously manual methods and allows seamless integration into hospital environment, independent of its routine work. Overall, it provides a pragmatic and flexible surgery-data acquisition system model with low impact and resource cost applicable to research in critical and practical medical circumstances.","[Liu, Quan; Ma, Li] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Informat Engn, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Quan; Ma, Li] Minist Educ, Key Lab Fiber Opt Sensing Technol & Informat Proc, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Fan, Shou-Zen] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Anesthesiol, Coll Med, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Abbod, Maysam F.] Brunel Univ London, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Lu, Cheng-Wei; Lin, Tzu-Yu; Shieh, Jiann-Shing] Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 135 Yuan Tung Rd, Chungli 32003, Taiwan; [Lu, Cheng-Wei; Lin, Tzu-Yu; Shieh, Jiann-Shing] Yuan Ze Univ, Innovat Ctr Big Data & Digital Convergence, 135 Yuan Tung Rd, Chungli 32003, Taiwan; [Lu, Cheng-Wei; Lin, Tzu-Yu] Far Eastern Mem Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, Ban Chiao, Taiwan; [Jen, Kuo-Kuang; Wu, Shang-Ju] Natl Chung Shan Inst Sci & Technol, Taoyuan, Longtan, Taiwan","Shieh, JS (corresponding author), Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 135 Yuan Tung Rd, Chungli 32003, Taiwan.;Shieh, JS (corresponding author), Yuan Ze Univ, Innovat Ctr Big Data & Digital Convergence, 135 Yuan Tung Rd, Chungli 32003, Taiwan.",quanliu@whut.edu.cn; excellentmary@whut.edu.cn; shouzen@gmail.com; maysam.abbod@brunel.ac.uk; drluchengwei@gmail.com; drlin1971@gmail.com; rgg@ms7.hinet.net; shanglu111@gmail.com; jsshieh@saturn.yzu.edu.tw,,"Fan, Shou-Zen/0000-0002-6849-8453","Wuhan University of Technology international exchange program [2015-JL-012]; National Chung-Shan Institute of Science & Technology in Taiwan [CSIST-095-V401]; China National Nature Science Foundation [51475342, 51675389]","This research, sponsored by Wuhan University of Technology international exchange program (Grant Number: 2015-JL-012).

However, the most advanced imaging archives today only index the studies' available meta-data, often containing limited amounts of clinically useful information. This work proposes an anatomic labeling architecture, integrated with an open source archive software, for improved multimodal content discovery in real-world medical imaging repositories. The proposed solution includes a technical specification for classifiers in an extensible medical imaging archive, a classification database for querying over the extracted information, and a set of proof-of-concept convolutional neural network classifiers for identifying the presence of organs in computed tomography scans. The system automatically extracts the anatomic region features, which are saved in the proposed database for later consumption by multimodal querying mechanisms. The classifiers were evaluated with cross-validation, yielding a best F1-score of 96% and an average accuracy of 97%.

This paper presents a novel method of using deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for identification and measurement of IMT on the far wall of the artery. The Region of Interest (ROI) is extracted using CNN architecture with 8 layers. 110 subjects are taken for the study. Each subject is recorded with one Right Common Carotid Artery (RCCA) and Left Common Carotid Artery (LCCA) frame resulting in 220 recordings. Patch based segmentation with 2640 patches are given to the training network for ROI localization. Intima Media Complex (IMC) is the area where IMT is measured. This region is extracted after defining the ROI. Keeping in mind the end objective of measurement of IMT values binary threshold with snake algorithm is applied to extract the lumen-intima and media-adventitia boundary. IMT values are measured for 20 cases and mean difference is found to be 0.08 mm.,"[Sudha, S.; Jayanthi, K.

In target areas like Kenya TB is highly prevalent and often co-occurring with HIV combined with low resources and limited medical assistance. In these regions an automatic screening system can provide a cost-effective solution for a large rural population. Our completely automatic TB screening system is processing the incoming CXRs (chest X-ray) by applying image preprocessing techniques to enhance the image quality followed by an adaptive segmentation based on model selection. The delineated lung regions are described by a multitude of image features. These characteristics are than optimized by a feature selection strategy to provide the best description for the classifier, which will later decide if the analyzed image is normal or abnormal. Our goal is to find the optimal feature set from a larger pool of generic image features, -used originally for problems such as object detection, image retrieval, etc. For performance evaluation measures such as under the curve (AUC) and accuracy (ACC) were considered. Using a neural network classifier on two publicly available data collections, -namely the Montgomery and the Shenzhen dataset, we achieved the maximum area under the curve and accuracy of 0.99 and 97.03%, respectively. Further, we compared our results with existing state-of-the-art systems and to radiologists' decision.","[Vajda, Szilard] Cent Washington Univ, Ellensburg, WA 98926 USA; [Karargyris, Alexandros] IBM Almaden Res, San Jose, CA USA; [Santosh, K.

In our system, we use attribute-based encryption (ABE) and identity-based encryption (IBE) to encrypt medical data, and use identity-based signature (IBS) to implement digital signatures. To achieve different functions of ABE, IBE and IBS in one cryptosystem, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive, called combined attribute-based/identity-based encryption and signature (C-AB/IB-ES). This greatly facilitates the management of the system, and does not need to introduce different cryptographic systems for different security requirements. In addition, we use blockchain techniques to ensure the integrity and traceability of medical data. Finally, we give a demonstrating application for medical insurance scene.","[Wang, Hao; Song, Yujiao] Shandong Normal Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China","Wang, H (corresponding author), Shandong Normal Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.",wanghao@sdnu.edu.cn; songyujiaosdnu@163.com,,"Wang, Hao/0000-0003-3472-3699","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61602287, 61672330, 61572294]; Primary Research & Development Plan of Shandong Province [2018GGX101037]","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61602287, No. 61672330, No. 61572294), and the Primary Research & Development Plan of Shandong Province (No. 2018GGX101037).","Akinyele J.

This study proposes a meta-heuristic framework using stochastic local search (SLS) combined with random forest (RF) where the aim is to specify the most important genes and proteins leading to the best classification of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients. First we use a stochastic local search meta-heuristic as a feature selection technique to select the most significant proteins to be used in the classification task step. Then we apply RF to classify new patients into their corresponding classes. The evaluation technique is to run the RF classifier on the training data to get a model. Then, we apply this model on the test data to find the appropriate class. We use as metrics the balanced accuracy (BAC) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) to measure the performance of our model. The proposed method is evaluated on the dataset issued from DREAM 9 challenge. The comparison is done with a pure random forest (without feature selection), and with the two best ranked results of the DREAM 9 challenge. We used three types of data: only clinical data, only proteomics data, and finally clinical and proteomics data combined. The numerical results show that the highest scores are obtained when using clinical data alone, and the lowest is obtained when using proteomics data alone. Further, our method succeeds in finding promising results compared to the methods presented in the DREAM challenge.","[Chebouba, Lokmane; Boughaci, Dalila] USTHB, Elect Engn & Comp Sci Fac, Dept Comp Sci, LRIA Lab, El Alia BP 32, Algiers, Algeria; [Guziolowski, Carito] Ecole Cent Nantes, UMR 6004, LS2N, Nantes, France","Chebouba, L (corresponding author), USTHB, Elect Engn & Comp Sci Fac, Dept Comp Sci, LRIA Lab, El Alia BP 32, Algiers, Algeria.",lchebouba@gmail.com; dboughaci@usthb.dz; carito.guziolowski@ls2n.fr,"Boughaci, Dalila/AAE-9298-2020; Boughaci, Dalila/Q-6367-2019","Boughaci, Dalila/0000-0001-5210-8951; ",,,"Breiman L, 2001, MACH LEARN, V45, P5, DOI 10.1023/A:101093340432; Yusta SC, 2009, PATTERN RECOGN LETT, V30, P525, DOI 10.1016/j.patrec.2008.11.01; Cerami EG, 2011, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V39, pD685, DOI 10.1093/nar/gkq103; Croft D, 2014, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V42, pD472, DOI 10.1093/nar/gkt110; Croft D, 2011, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V39, pD691, DOI 10.1093/nar/gkq101; Dhaenens C., 2016, USE METAHEURISTICS F, P135, DOI [10.1002/9781119347569.ch7, DOI 10.1002/9781119347569.CH7; Feizi-Derakhshi M.-R., 2014, INT C MACH LEARN EL, P1; Gawehn E, 2016, MOL INFORM, V35, P3, DOI 10.1002/minf.20150100; Hall M, 2009, ACM SIGKDD EXPLOR NE, V11, P10, DOI [DOI 10.1145/1656274.1656278, 10.1145/1656274.1656278; Hall M.

Altered verticality has been connected with disorders in the otolithic, visual or proprioceptive systems, caused by stroke, Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis, among others. Currently, this test is carried out using a variety of specific, mostly homemade apparatuses that include moving planes, buckets, hemispheric domes or a line projected in a screen. Our aim is to develop a flexible, inexpensive, user-friendly and easily extensible system based on virtual reality for the measurement of the SVV and several related visual diagnostic tests, and validate it through an experimental evaluation. Two different hardware configurations were tested with 50 healthy volunteers in a controlled environment; 28 of them were males and 22 females, with ages ranging from 18 to 49 years, being 23 the average age. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was computed in each device. In addition, a usability survey was conducted. ICC = 0.85 in the first configuration (CI = 0.75-0.92), ICC = 0.76 in the second configuration (CI = 0.61-0.87), both with 95% of confidence, which means a substantial reliability. Moreover, 92.2% of subjects rated the usability of the system as very good. Our evaluation showed that the proposed system is suitable for the measurement of SVV in healthy subjects. The next step is to perform a more elaborated experimentation on patients and compare the results with the measurements obtained from traditional methods.","[Negrillo-Cardenas, Jose; Rueda-Ruiz, Antonio J.; Ogayar-Anguita, Carlos J.; Segura-Sanchez, Rafael J.] Univ Jaen, Dept Comp Sci, Campus Las Lagunillas S-N,A3 Bldg, Jaen 23071, Spain; [Lomas-Vega, Rafael] Univ Jaen, Dept Hlth Sci, Jaen, Spain","Negrillo-Cardenas, J (corresponding author), Univ Jaen, Dept Comp Sci, Campus Las Lagunillas S-N,A3 Bldg, Jaen 23071, Spain.",negrillo@ujaen.es; ajrueda@ujaen.es; cogayar@ujaen.es; rlomas@ujaen.es; rsegura@ujaen.es,"Ogayar-Anguita, Carlos-Javier/K-2166-2017; Rueda-Ruiz, Antonio Jesús/AAY-5298-2021; Cárdenas, José Negrillo/U-2043-2019; Segura, Rafael J./J-3622-2012","Ogayar-Anguita, Carlos-Javier/0000-0003-0958-990X; Rueda-Ruiz, Antonio Jesús/0000-0001-7692-454X; Cárdenas, José Negrillo/0000-0001-8916-923X; Segura, Rafael J./0000-0002-3075-6963","Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports [FPU16/01439]","This research was supported partially by the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports via a doctoral grant to the first author (Ref.

However, previous attempts to convince the private clinics to adopt EMRs to document health information have faced challenges, as the EMR adoption has been voluntary. The lack of electronic data shared by private clinics carries direct impacts to the efficacy of electronic record sharing between public and private healthcare providers. To increase the likelihood of buy-in, it is essential to proactively identify the users' and organizations' needs and capabilities before large-scale implementation. As part of the reform initiative, this study examined factors affecting the adoption of EMRs in small or solo private general practice clinics, by analyzing the experiences and opinions of the physicians and clinical assistants during the pilot implementation of the technology, with the purpose to learn from it before full-scale rollout. In-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted with 23 physicians and clinical assistants from seven small or solo private general practice clinics to evaluate their experiences, expectations, and opinions regarding the deployment of EMRs. Interview transcripts were content analyzed to identify key factors. Factors affecting the adoption of EMRs to record and manage health care information were identified as follows: system interface design; system functions; stability and reliability of hardware, software, and computing networks; financial and time costs; task and outcome performance, work practice, and clinical workflow; physical space in clinics; trust in technology; users' information technology literacy; training and technical support; and social and organizational influences. The factors are interrelated with the others. The adoption factors identified are multifaceted, ranging from technological characteristics, clinician-technology interactions, skills and knowledge, and the user-workflow-technology fit. Other findings, which have been relatively underrepresented in previous studies, contribute unique insights about the influence of work and social environment on the adoption of EMRs, including limited clinic space and the effects of physicians' decision to use the technology on clinical staffs' adoption decisions. Potential strategies to address the concerns, overcome adoption barriers, and define relevant policies are discussed.","[Or, Calvin] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Tong, Ellen; Chan, Summer] Hong Kong Hosp Author, Hlth Informat Dept, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Tan, Joseph] McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, Hamilton, ON, Canada","Or, C (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",klor@hku.hk; ellentong@ha.org.hk; tanjosep@mcmaster.ca; summer@ha.org.hk,,,Hospital Authority of Hong Kong [RCGASNA100001C]; University of Hong Kong,This study was supported in part by the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong (contract research project RCGASNA100001C; PI: Calvin Or) and the University of Hong Kong.,"Ahmadian L, 2014, J MED SYST, V38, DOI 10.1007/s10916-014-0151-; Berg M, 1998, INT J MED INFORM, V52, P243, DOI 10.1016/S1386-5056(98)00143-; Berkowitz L., 2008, ELECT HLTH RECORDS G, P24; Boonstra A, 2010, BMC HEALTH SERV RES, V10, DOI 10.1186/1472-6963-10-23; Boonstra A, 2014, BMC HEALTH SERV RES, V14, DOI 10.1186/1472-6963-14-37; Chao WC, 2013, J MED SYST, V37, DOI 10.1007/s10916-013-9960-; Collier R, 2015, CAN MED ASSOC J, V187, pE17, DOI 10.1503/cmaj.109-495; Ford EW, 2006, J AM MED INFORM ASSN, V13, P106, DOI 10.1197/jamia.M191; Hackos J.T., 1998, USER TASK ANAL INTE; Hong Kong Legislative Council Panel on Health Services, 2009, CB21006080903 LC, V1-4; Iakovidis I, 1998, INT J MED INFORM, V52, P105, DOI 10.1016/S1386-5056(98)00129-; Institute of Medicine (US), 2001, COMMITTEE QUALITY HL, DOI [10.17726/10027, DOI 10.17726/10027; KANDOGAN E, 2003, CRAFT INFORM VISUALI, P21; Karsh B., 2011, HDB HUMAN FACTORS ER, Vsecond, P24; Karsh BT, 2004, QUAL SAF HEALTH CARE, V13, P388, DOI 10.1136/qshc.2004.01032; Keshavjee K, 2009, STUD HEALTH TECHNOL, V143, P107, DOI 10.3233/978-1-58603-979-0-10; Kruse CS, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0628-; Lambrew J., 2013, WHITE HOUSE BLO; Larkin K., 2011, CHI 11 HUM FACT COMP, P160; Larson K., 1998, CHI 98.

Although the blockchain is secure, attackers have managed to gain access into the blockchain as legal users, thereby comprising important and crucial information. Examples of mobile malware include root exploit, botnets, and Trojans and root exploit is one of the most dangerous malware. It compromises the operating system kernel in order to gain root privileges which are then used by attackers to bypass the security mechanisms, to gain complete control of the operating system, to install other possible types of malware to the devices, and finally, to steal victims' private keys linked to the blockchain. For the purpose of maximizing the security of the blockchain-based medical data management (BMDM), it is crucial to investigate the novel features and approaches contained in root exploit malware. This study proposes to use the bio-inspired method of practical swarm optimization (PSO) which automatically select the exclusive features that contain the novel android debug bridge (ADB). This study also adopts boosting (adaboost, realadaboost, logitboost, and multiboost) to enhance the machine learning prediction that detects unknown root exploit, and scrutinized three categories of features including (1) system command, (2) directory path and (3) code-based. The evaluation gathered from this study suggests a marked accuracy value of 93% with Logitboost in the simulation. Logitboost also helped to predicted all the root exploit samples in our developed system, the root exploit detection system (RODS).","[Firdaus, Ahmad; Ab Razak, Mohd Faizal; Bachok, Syafiq] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Comp Syst & Software Engn, Kuantan 26300, Pahang, Malaysia; [Anuar, Nor Badrul; Ab Razak, Mohd Faizal; Bachok, Syafiq] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Syst & Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Hashem, Ibrahim Abaker Targio] Taylors Univ, Sch Comp & IT, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, Malaysia; [Sangaiah, Arun Kumar] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India","Sangaiah, AK (corresponding author), Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India.",firdausza@ump.edu.my; badrul@um.edu.my; faizalabrazak@siswa.um.edu.my; targio_123@yahoo.com; syafiqbachok@siswa.um.edu.my; arunkumarsangaiah@gmail.com,", Ahmad/AAH-4337-2019; Firdaus, Ahmad/O-2017-2018; Sangaiah, Arun Kumar/U-6785-2019; Hashem, Ibrahim Abaker Targio/AAP-1204-2020; Anuar, Nor Badrul/B-3101-2010; Razak, Mohd Faizal Ab/O-2027-2018",", Ahmad/0000-0002-7116-2643; Sangaiah, Arun Kumar/0000-0002-0229-2460; Hashem, Ibrahim Abaker Targio/0000-0001-7611-9540; Anuar, Nor Badrul/0000-0003-4380-5303; Ab Razak, Mohd Faizal/0000-0002-7388-4340","Universiti Malaysia Pahang, under the Grant Faculty of Computer Systems and Software Engineering [FSK1000, RDU180360]","This work was supported by Universiti Malaysia Pahang, under the Grant Faculty of Computer Systems and Software Engineering (FSK1000), RDU180360.","Aafer Y, 2013, L N INST COMP SCI SO, V127, P8; Ab Razak MF, 2016, J NETW COMPUT APPL, V75, P58, DOI 10.1016/j.jnca.2016.08.02; Abu Samra AA, 2013, 2013 SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INNOVATIVE MOBILE AND INTERNET SERVICES IN UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING (IMIS 2013), P729, DOI 10.1109/IMIS.2013.11; Adewole KS, 2017, J NETW COMPUT APPL, V79, P41, DOI 10.1016/j.jnca.2016.11.03; Afifi F, 2016, PLOS ONE, V11, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.016262; Alhendawi K.

In a typical classification problem, information fusion is a process whereby the effective combination of the data can achieve a more accurate system. The purpose of this article was to provide an accurate algorithm for classifying HRV signals in various psychological states. Therefore, a novel feature level fusion approach was proposed. First, using the theory of information, two similarity indicators of the signal were extracted, including correntropy and Cauchy-Schwarz divergence. Applying probabilistic neural network (PNN) and k-nearest neighbor (kNN), the performance of each index in the classification of meditators and non-meditators HRV signals was appraised. Then, three fusion rules, including division, product, and weighted sum rules were used to combine the information of both similarity measures. For the first time, we propose an algorithm to define the weights of each feature based on the statistical p-values. The performance of HRV classification using combined features was compared with the non-combined features. Totally, the accuracy of 100% was obtained for discriminating all states. The results showed the strong ability and proficiency of division and weighted sum rules in the improvement of the classifier accuracies.","[Goshvarpour, Ateke; Goshvarpour, Atefeh] Sahand Univ Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Fac Elect Engn, Tabriz, Iran; [Goshvarpour, Atefeh] Khayyam Blvd,Khayyam 20,54, Mashhad, Khorasan Razavi, Iran","Goshvarpour, A (corresponding author), Sahand Univ Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Fac Elect Engn, Tabriz, Iran.;Goshvarpour, A (corresponding author), Khayyam Blvd,Khayyam 20,54, Mashhad, Khorasan Razavi, Iran.",ak_goshvarpour@sut.ac.ir; af_goshvarpour@sut.ac.ir,"Goshvarpour, Atefeh/AAC-3145-2020; Goshvarpour, Ateke/AAB-5275-2019","Goshvarpour, Atefeh/0000-0002-0343-4344; Goshvarpour, Ateke/0000-0002-5185-5645",,,"Acharya UR, 2004, BIOMED ENG ONLINE, V3, DOI 10.1186/1475-925X-3-2; Alvarez-Ramirez J, 2017, CHAOS SOLITON FRACT, V99, P57, DOI 10.1016/j.chaos.2017.03.02; Bevilacqua F, 2018, ENTERTAIN COMPUT, V24, P10, DOI 10.1016/j.entcom.2017.10.00; Czarnecki WM, 2017, PATTERN ANAL APPL, V20, P383, DOI 10.1007/s10044-015-0497-; Czarnecki WM, 2015, EXPERT SYST APPL, V42, P5591, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2015.03.00; Gao JL, 2016, NEUROSCI LETT, V616, P218, DOI 10.1016/j.neulet.2016.01.00; Garde A, 2009, IEEE ENG MED BIO, P4687, DOI 10.1109/IEMBS.2009.533421; Ghongade R, 2014, 2014 INNOVATIVE APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ON POWER, ENERGY AND CONTROLS WITH THEIR IMPACT ON HUMANITY (CIPECH), P80, DOI 10.1109/CIPECH.2014.701905; Goldberger AL, 2000, CIRCULATION, V101, pE215, DOI 10.1161/01.CIR.101.23.e21; Goshvarpour A., 2012, IF IMAGE GRAPH SIGNA, V2, P44, DOI [DOI 10.5815/ijigsp.2012.02.07, 10.5815/ijigsp.2012.02.07; Goshvarpour A., 2012, I J INTELL SYST APPL, V2, P35, DOI DOI 10.5815/IJISA.2012.02.0; Goshvarpour A., 2012, INT J IMAGE GRAPHICS, V4, P23, DOI DOI 10.5815/IJIGSP.201; Goshvarpour A, 2017, AUSTRALAS PHYS ENG S, V40, P617, DOI 10.1007/s13246-017-0571-; Goshvarpour A, 2016, BIOMED ENG-APP BAS C, V28, DOI 10.4015/S101623721650040; Goshvarpour A, 2015, BIOMED J, V38, P229, DOI 10.4103/2319-4170.14352; Goshvarpour A, 2011, DIGIT SIGNAL PROCESS, V21, P208, DOI 10.1016/j.dsp.2010.06.01; Goshvarpour A, 2013, COGN NEURODYNAMICS, V7, P39, DOI 10.1007/s11571-012-9215-; Guaita M, 2015, PLOS ONE, V10, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.012264; Han J, 2012, MOR KAUF D, P; Hasanbelliu E, 2014, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V36, P2436, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.2014.232458; Hassan MM, 2018, INFORM FUSION, V41, P105, DOI 10.1016/j.inffus.2017.08.00; Huikuri HV, 1999, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V34, P1878, DOI 10.1016/S0735-1097(99)00468-; Kullback S., 1959, INFORM THEORY STA; Larose D.

A total of 116 eyes with PACS underwent LPI and time-domain ASOCT scans (temporal and nasal cuts) were performed before and 1 month after LPI. All the post-treatment scans were classified to one of the following categories: (a) both angles open, (b) one of two angles open and (c) both angles closed. After LPI, success is defined as one or more angles changed from close to open. In this proposed method, the pre and post-LPI ASOCT scans were registered at the corresponding angles based on similarities between the respective local descriptor features and random sample consensus technique was used to identify the largest consensus set of correspondences between the pre and post-LPI ASOCT scans. Subsequently, features such as correlation co-efficient (CC) and structural similarity index (SSIM) were extracted and correlated with the success of LPI. We included 116 eyes and 91 (78.44%) eyes fulfilled the criteria for success after LPI. Using the CC and SSIM index scores from this training set of ASOCT images, our algorithm showed that the success of LPI in eyes with narrow angles can be predicted with 89.7% accuracy, specificity of 95.2% and sensitivity of 36.4% based on pre-LPI ASOCT scans only. Using pre-LPI ASOCT scans, our proposed algorithm showed good accuracy in predicting the success of LPI for PACS eyes. This fully-automated algorithm could aid decision making in offering LPI as a prophylactic treatment for PACS.","[Koh, Victor; Aquino, Maria Cecilia D.; Chew, Paul T.; Sng, Chelvin] Natl Univ Singapore Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Singapore 119074, Singapore; [Swamidoss, Issac Niwas] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Sng, Chelvin] Singapore Eye Res Inst, Singapore 168751, Singapore; [Sng, Chelvin] Moorfields Eye Hosp, Dept Glaucoma, London, England","Sng, C (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Singapore 119074, Singapore.;Sng, C (corresponding author), Singapore Eye Res Inst, Singapore 168751, Singapore.;Sng, C (corresponding author), Moorfields Eye Hosp, Dept Glaucoma, London, England.",viktorkoh@gmail.com; issacniwas@gmail.com; mcdaquino@gmail.com; paul_chew@nuhs.edu.sg; chelvin@gmail.com,"Swamidoss, Issac Niwas/AAZ-1920-2020","Sng, Chelvin/0000-0002-9837-6019",National Medical Research Council New Investigator Grant [NIG10Nov019]; National Medical Research Council Clinician-Scientist Individual Research Grant New Investigator Grant [CNIG14Nov017],This work was supported by (1) National Medical Research Council New Investigator Grant No: NIG10Nov019 and (2) National Medical Research Council Clinician-Scientist Individual Research Grant New Investigator Grant No: CNIG14Nov017.,"Alven J., 2015, LECT NOTES COMPUTER, V912; Ang BCH, 2016, CLIN EXP OPHTHALMOL, V44, P159, DOI 10.1111/ceo.1267; Ang LPK, 2000, OPHTHALMOLOGY, V107, P2092, DOI 10.1016/S0161-6420(00)00360-; Bai XL, 2016, J MED SYST, V40, DOI 10.1007/s10916-016-0436-; Bay H, 2008, COMPUT VIS IMAGE UND, V110, P346, DOI 10.1016/j.cviu.2007.09.01; Casson J, 2007, BRIT J OPHTHALMOL, V91, P710, DOI 10.1136/bjo.2006.10757; CONGDON N, 1992, SURV OPHTHALMOL, V36, P411, DOI 10.1016/S0039-6257(05)80022-; Congdon NG, 1996, ACTA OPHTHALMOL SCAN, V74, P11; Ferrante E, 2017, MED IMAGE ANAL, V39, P101, DOI 10.1016/j.media.2017.04.01; FISCHLER MA, 1981, COMMUN ACM, V24, P381, DOI 10.1145/358669.35869; Foo LL, 2012, OPHTHALMOLOGY, V119, P278, DOI 10.1016/j.ophtha.2011.07.04; Foster PJ, 2002, BRIT J OPHTHALMOL, V86, P238, DOI 10.1136/bjo.86.2.23; Foster PJ, 1996, ARCH OPHTHALMOL-CHIC, V114, P1235, DOI 10.1001/archopht.1996.0110014043501; Foster PJ, 2001, BRIT J OPHTHALMOL, V85, P1277, DOI 10.1136/bjo.85.11.127; Guryanov F, 2017, SIGNAL PROCESS-IMAGE, V59, P12, DOI 10.1016/j.image.2017.04.00; Hajnal J., 2001, MED IMAGE REGISTRATI, V1st e; Hall M.A., 1999, THESIS U WAIKATO HA; He MG, 2007, OPHTHALMOLOGY, V114, P494, DOI 10.1016/j.ophtha.2006.06.05; Hu Z, 1989, CHIN J OPHTHALMOL, V25, P11; Huang GF, 2012, CURR EYE RES, V37, P575, DOI 10.3109/02713683.2012.65539; Khor CC, 2016, NAT GENET, V48, P556, DOI 10.1038/ng.354; Kwon J, 2017, OPHTHALMOLOGY, V124, P1039, DOI 10.1016/j.ophtha.2017.02.02; Le Folgoc L, 2017, MED IMAGE ANAL, V36, P79, DOI 10.1016/j.media.2016.09.00; Lee KS, 2011, JPN J OPHTHALMOL, V55, P213, DOI 10.1007/s10384-011-0009-; Lee RY, 2014, OPHTHALMOLOGY, V121, P1194, DOI 10.1016/j.ophtha.2013.12.02; Liu L, 2011, CLIN EXP OPHTHALMOL, V39, P614, DOI 10.1111/j.1442-9071.2011.02521.; Lu Y, 2018, PLOS ONE, V13, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.019038; McLaughlin R.

The device has been widely used to detect and monitor the patient's heart rate. The data collected hence has the highest authenticity assurance and is convenient for further electric stimulation. In the pacemaker, ECG detector is one of the most important element. The device is available in its new digital form, which is more efficient and accurate in performance with the added advantage of economical power consumption platform. In this work, a joint algorithm based on biorthogonal wavelet transform and run-length encoding (RLE) is proposed for QRS complex detection of the ECG signal and compressing the detected ECG data. Biorthogonal wavelet transform of the input ECG signal is first calculated using a modified demand based filter bank architecture which consists of a series combination of three lowpass filters with a highpass filter. Lowpass and highpass filters are realized using a linear phase structure which reduces the hardware cost of the proposed design approximately by 50%. Then, the location of the R-peak is found by comparing the denoised ECG signal with the threshold value. The proposed R-peak detector achieves the highest sensitivity and positive predictivity of 99.75 and 99.98 respectively with the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Also, the proposed R-peak detector achieves a comparatively low data error rate (DER) of 0.002. The use of RLE for the compression of detected ECG data achieves a higher compression ratio (CR) of 17.1. To justify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the results have been compared with the existing methods, like Huffman coding/simple predictor, Huffman coding/adaptive, and slope predictor/fixed length packaging.","[Kumar, Ashish; Kumar, Manjeet; Komaragiri, Rama] Bennett Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Greater Noida 201308, UP, India","Kumar, M (corresponding author), Bennett Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Greater Noida 201308, UP, India.",akumar.1june@gmail.com; manjeetchhillar@gmail.com; rama.komaragiri@bennett.edu.in,"Kumar, Manjeet/K-1325-2015; Komaragiri, Rama/AAH-8327-2020","Kumar, Manjeet/0000-0001-6578-9741; Komaragiri, Rama/0000-0002-0468-8506",,,"Abibullaev B, 2011, J MED SYST, V35, P683, DOI 10.1007/s10916-009-9405-; Afonso VX, 1999, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V46, P192, DOI 10.1109/10.74088; [Anonymous], 2016, AGIN; Arnavut Z, 2007, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V54, P410, DOI 10.1109/TBME.2006.88882; Banerjee A, 2015, IEEE T MOBILE COMPUT, V14, P904, DOI 10.1109/TMC.2014.233460; Benali R, 2012, J MED SYST, V36, P883, DOI 10.1007/s10916-010-9551-; Bhavtosh D.

On the one hand, this attempts to give meaning to the increasing life expectancy, as living above a certain threshold of pain and lack of autonomy or mobility is both degrading and unfair. On the other hand, it lowers the cost of continuous care, as individuals with high quality of life indexes tend to have lower hospital readmissions or secondary complications, not to mention higher physical and mental health. In this paper, we evaluate the current state of the art in physiological therapy (biofeedback) along with the existing medical grade and consumer grade hardware for physiological research. We provide a quick primer on the most commonly monitored physiologic metrics, as well as a brief discussion on the current state of the art in biofeedback-assisted medical applications. We then go on to present a comparative analysis between medical and consumer grade biofeedback devices and discuss the hardware specifications and potential practical applications of each consumer grade device in terms of functionality and adaptability for controlled (laboratory) and uncontrolled (field) studies. We end this article with some empirical observations based on our study so that readers might use take them into consideration when arranging a laboratory or real-world experience, thus avoiding costly time delays and material expenditures.","[Nogueira, Pedro; Urbano, Joana; Reis, Luis Paulo; Cardoso, Henrique Lopes; Silva, Daniel Castro; Rocha, Ana Paula; Faria, Brigida Monica] Artificial Intelligence & Comp Sci Lab LIACC, Porto, Portugal; [Nogueira, Pedro; Urbano, Joana; Cardoso, Henrique Lopes; Silva, Daniel Castro; Rocha, Ana Paula] Univ Porto FEUP, Fac Engn, Porto, Portugal; [Reis, Luis Paulo] Univ Minho EEUM, Sch Engn, Braga, Portugal; [Goncalves, Joaquim] Polytech Inst Cavado & Ave, Technol School, EST IPCA, Barcelos, Portugal; [Faria, Brigida Monica] Porto Polytech, Higher Sch Hlth, ESS P Porto, Porto, Portugal","Nogueira, P (corresponding author), Artificial Intelligence & Comp Sci Lab LIACC, Porto, Portugal.;Nogueira, P (corresponding author), Univ Porto FEUP, Fac Engn, Porto, Portugal.",pedro.alves.nogueira@fe.up.pt; jurbano@fe.up.pt; lpreis@dsi.uminho.pt; hlc@fe.up.pt; dcs@fe.up.pt; arocha@fe.up.pt; jgoncalves@ipca.pt; btf@ess.ipp.pt,"Cardoso, Henrique Lopes/AAL-5725-2020; Reis, Luis Paulo/C-5751-2008; Cardoso, Henrique Lopes/M-5275-2013; Faria, Brigida Monica/C-6649-2012; Castro Silva, Daniel/O-3205-2013","Cardoso, Henrique Lopes/0000-0003-1252-7515; Reis, Luis Paulo/0000-0002-4709-1718; Cardoso, Henrique Lopes/0000-0003-1252-7515; Goncalves, Joaquim/0000-0003-2219-1816; Faria, Brigida Monica/0000-0003-2102-3407; Castro Silva, Daniel/0000-0001-9293-0341; Rocha, Ana Paula/0000-0002-8129-9758","Norte Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE), under the PORTUGAL Partnership Agreement, through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) [NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-003446]; strategic project LIACC [PEst-UID/CEC/00027/2013]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UID/CEC/00027/2013] Funding Source: FCT","This article is a result of the project QVida+: Estimacao Continua de Qualidade de Vida para Auxilio Eficaz a Decisao Clinica, NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-003446, supported by Norte Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

With this medical information, we have decided to develop an alert system for aiding in medical treatment. The purpose of this investigation is to not only to integrate an alert framework into the electronic heath record system. but also to formulate a modeling method of this knowledge. A trial alert framework was developed for the staff in various occupational categories at the UMH. Based on findings of subsequent interviews, a more detailed and upgraded alert framework was constructed, resulting in the final model. Based on our current findings, an alert framework was developed with four major items. Based on the analysis of the medical practices from the trial model, it has been concluded that there are four major risk patterns that trigger the alert. Furthermore, the current alert framework contains detailed definitions which are easily substituted into the database, leading to easy implementation of the electronic health records.","[Sakata, Takuya; Araki, Kenji; Yamazaki, Tomoyoshi; Kawano, Koichi; Maeda, Minoru; Kushima, Muneo; Araki, Sanae] Univ Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan","Sakata, T (corresponding author), Univ Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.",t_sakata@med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp,,"Sakata, Takuya/0000-0002-4015-6689",,,"Aarts Jos, 2007, Int J Med Inform, V76 Suppl 1, pS4, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2006.05.00; Abraham C, 2011, INT J MED INFORM, V80, P157, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2011.01.00; Arel I, 2010, IEEE COMPUT INTELL M, V5, P13, DOI 10.1109/MCI.2010.93836; Blumenthal D, 2010, NEW ENGL J MED, V363, P501, DOI 10.1056/NEJMp100611; Buchanan BG, 1984, RULE BASED EXPERT S; CLANCEY WJ, 1983, ARTIF INTELL, V20, P215, DOI 10.1016/0004-3702(83)90008-; Dang JB, 2008, J BIOMED INFORM, V41, P829, DOI 10.1016/j.jbi.2008.05.01; DUDA RO, 1983, SCIENCE, V220, P261, DOI 10.1126/science.634019; Liao SH, 2005, EXPERT SYST APPL, V28, P93, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2004.08.00; Ludwick DA, 2009, INT J MED INFORM, V78, P22, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2008.06.00; Partra P.

A CNN model was designed with six optimized convolution layers including activation, pooling, and dropout layers. One-dimensional (1D) convolution, rectified linear units (ReLU), and max pooling were applied to the convolution, activation, and pooling layers, respectively. For training and evaluation of the CNN model, a single-lead ECG dataset was collected from 82 subjects with OSA and was divided into training (including data from 63 patients with 34,281 events) and testing (including data from 19 patients with 8571 events) datasets. Using this CNN model, a precision of 0.99%, a recall of 0.99%, and an F-1-score of 0.99% were attained with the training dataset; these values were all 0.96% when the CNN was applied to the testing dataset. These results show that the proposed CNN model can be used to detect OSA accurately on the basis of a single-lead ECG. Ultimately, this CNN model may be used as a screening tool for those suspected to suffer from OSA.","[Urtnasan, Erdenebayar; Park, Jong-Uk; Lee, Kyoung-Joung] Yonsei Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Coll Hlth Sci, 1 Yeonsedae Gil, Wonju 26493, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Joo, Eun-Yeon] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Med, Samsung Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Seoul, South Korea","Lee, KJ (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Coll Hlth Sci, 1 Yeonsedae Gil, Wonju 26493, Gangwon Do, South Korea.",lkj5809@yonsei.ac.kr,"Erdenebayar, Urtnasan/AAC-9619-2020",,National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education; Local Innovative Creative Human Resource Training Project [NRF-2014H1C1A1063845],This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Ministry of Education.

With no satisfying prior solutions for matching ICD-10 code sequences, this paper presents a method which effectively captures the clinical similarity among routine patients who have multiple comorbidities and complex care needs. Our method leverages the recent progress in representation learning of individual ICD-10 codes, and it explicitly uses the sequential order of codes for matching. Empirical evaluation on a state-wide cancer data collection shows that our proposed method achieves significantly higher matching performance compared with state-of-the-art methods ignoring the sequential order. Our method better identifies similar patients in a number of clinical outcomes including readmission and mortality outlook. Although this paper focuses on ICD-10 diagnosis code sequences, our method can be adapted to work with other codified sequence data.","[Dang Nguyen; Luo, Wei; Venkatesh, Svetha; Dinh Phung] Deakin Univ, Ctr Pattern Recognit & Data Analyt, Sch Informat Technol, Geelong, Vic, Australia","Nguyen, D (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Ctr Pattern Recognit & Data Analyt, Sch Informat Technol, Geelong, Vic, Australia.",d.nguyen@deakin.edu.au; wei.luo@deakin.edu.au; svetha.venkatesh@deakin.edu.au; dinh.phung@deakin.edu.au,"Nguyen, Dang/AAW-8823-2021; Luo, Wei/A-6043-2011","Luo, Wei/0000-0002-4711-7543; venkatesh, svetha/0000-0001-8675-6631; Nguyen, Dang/0000-0002-0401-988X; Phung, Dinh/0000-0002-9977-8247",Telstra-Deakin Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Big Data and Machine Learning; Australian Research Council (ARC),This work is partially supported by the Telstra-Deakin Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Big Data and Machine Learning.

This research aimed to study the acute effect of 400 mg of caffeine monohydrate on the psycho-physiological response and rifle marksmanship of warfighters during a close quarter combat simulation. We analysed parameter of heart rate, blood lactate, cortical arousal, state anxiety and marksmanship of 20 Spanish Army veteran warfighters before and after a close quarter combat simulation in a double-blind procedure, also a correlation analysis was conducted between all the study variables. Marksmanship of warfighters did not improve with the caffeine ingestion, but it produced an increase in blood lactate concentration (caffeine: 1.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 9.2 +/- 1.1 mmol.l(-1); placebo: 1.8 +/- 0.7 vs. 6.9 +/- 2.2 mmol.l(-1)), cortical arousal (% of change: caffeine: 2.51; placebo: -1.96) and heart rate (caffeine: 80.0 +/- 7.2 vs. 172.9 +/- 28.2 bpm; placebo: 79.3 +/- 6.4 vs. 154.0 +/- 26.8 bpm). In addition, higher heart rate values correlated negatively with marksmanship in close quarter combat. We concluded that caffeine intake did not improve the warfighters rifle marksmanship in close quarter combat possibly due to the increase in the physiological response.","[Diaz-Manzano, Montana; Juan Robles-Perez, Jose; Javier Clemente-Suarez, Vicente] Studies Ctr Appl Combat CESCA, Toledo, Spain; [Diaz-Manzano, Montana; Javier Clemente-Suarez, Vicente] European Univ Madrid, Appl Psychophysiol Res Grp, Madrid, Spain; [Juan Robles-Perez, Jose] Light Forces Head Quarter Spanish Army, Madrid, Spain; [Herrera-Mendoza, Ketty; Javier Clemente-Suarez, Vicente] Univ Costa, Grp Invest Cultura Educ & Soc, Barranquilla, Colombia; [Herrera-Tapias, Belina] Univ Costa, Grp Invest Derecho Polit & Soc, Barranquilla, Colombia; [Fernandez-Lucas, Jesus] European Univ Madrid, Appl Biotechnol Grp, Madrid, Spain; [Fernandez-Lucas, Jesus] Univ Costa, Grp Invest Desarrollo Agroind Sostenible, Barranquilla, Colombia; [Aznar-Lain, Susana] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Sports Sci, PAFS Res Grp, Toledo, Spain; [Javier Clemente-Suarez, Vicente] Fac Sport Sci, Dept Sport Sci, Calle Tajo S-N, Madrid 28670, Spain","Clemente-Suarez, VJ (corresponding author), Studies Ctr Appl Combat CESCA, Toledo, Spain.;Clemente-Suarez, VJ (corresponding author), European Univ Madrid, Appl Psychophysiol Res Grp, Madrid, Spain.;Clemente-Suarez, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Costa, Grp Invest Cultura Educ & Soc, Barranquilla, Colombia.;Clemente-Suarez, VJ (corresponding author), Fac Sport Sci, Dept Sport Sci, Calle Tajo S-N, Madrid 28670, Spain.",vctxente@yahoo.es,"Fernández-Lucas, Jesús/O-8923-2019; Lucas, Jesús Fernández/R-6271-2018; Aznar, Susana/AAD-9999-2021; Clemente-Suarez, Vicente Javier/K-7980-2014","Fernández-Lucas, Jesús/0000-0001-7045-8306; Lucas, Jesús Fernández/0000-0001-7045-8306; Herrera, Belina/0000-0002-5974-7040; Clemente-Suarez, Vicente Javier/0000-0002-2397-2801",,,"Fernandez EMA, 2007, PSICOTHEMA, V19, P15; Bell DG, 2000, AVIAT SPACE ENVIR MD, V71, P41; Byung-Hyun K., 1989, KOREAN J SPORT SCI, V1, P4; Clemente Suárez V.J., 2012, Sanid.

The reliability models are restricted to using particular types of methodologies and restricted number of parameters. There are a number of techniques and methodologies that may be used for reliability prediction. There is need to focus on parameters consideration while estimating reliability. The reliability of a system may increase or decreases depending on the selection of different parameters used. Thus there is need to identify factors that heavily affecting the reliability of the system. In present days, reusability is mostly used in the various area of research. Reusability is the basis of Component-Based System (CBS). The cost, time and human skill can be saved using Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) concepts. CBSE metrics may be used to assess those techniques which are more suitable for estimating system reliability. Soft computing is used for small aswell as large-scale problemswhere it is difficult to find accurate results due to uncertainty or randomness. Several possibilities are available to apply soft computing techniques in medicine related problems. Clinical science of medicine using fuzzy-logic, neural network methodology significantly while basic science of medicine using neural-networks-genetic algorithm most frequently and preferably. There is unavoidable interest shown bymedical scientists to use the various soft computingmethodologies in genetics, physiology, radiology, cardiology and neurology discipline. CBSE boost users to reuse the past and existing software for making new products to provide quality with a saving of time, memory space, and money. This paper focused on assessment of commonly used soft computing technique like Genetic Algorithm (GA), Neural-Network (NN), Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). This paper presents working of soft computing techniques and assessment of soft computing techniques to predict reliability. The parameter considered while estimating and prediction of reliability are also discussed. This study can be used in estimation and prediction of the reliability of various instruments used in the medical system, software engineering, computer engineering and mechanical engineering also.

The case of Ebola epidemic in West Africa in recent years has shown the need for pervasive screening. The trend today in diseases surveillance is consisting of epidemiological data collection about emerging infectious diseases using social media, wearable sensors systems, or mobile applications and data analysis. This approach presents various limitations. This paper proposes a novel approach for diseases monitoring and risk prevention of spreading infectious diseases. The proposed approach, aiming at overcoming the limitation of existing disease surveillance approaches, combines the hybrid crowdsensing paradigm with sensing individuals' bio-signals using optical sensors for monitoring any risks of spreading emerging infectious diseases in any (ad-hoc) crowds. A proof-of-concept has been performed using a drone armed with a cat s60 smartphone featuring a Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) camera. According to the results of the conducted experiment, the concept has the potential to improve the conventional epidemiological data collection. The measurement is reliable, and the recorded data are valid. The measurement error rates are about 8%.","[Edoh, Thierry] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Informat 11, Boltzmannstr 3, D-85748 Munich, Germany","Edoh, T (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Inst Informat 11, Boltzmannstr 3, D-85748 Munich, Germany.",edoh@informatik-tu-muenchen.de,"EDOH, Thierry Oscar/J-5824-2018","EDOH, Thierry Oscar/0000-0002-7390-3396",,,"Aloi G, 2017, J NETW COMPUT APPL, V81, P74, DOI 10.1016/j.jnca.2016.10.01; Biswas P, 2015, HUM-COMPUT INT-SPRIN, P1, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4471-6708-; Brownstein JS, 2008, PLOS MED, V5, P1019, DOI 10.1371/journal.pmed.005015; Carpenter A, 2016, EUROPACE, V18, P791, DOI 10.1093/europace/euv42; Cavoukian A., 2012, INF PRIVACY COMMISSI, P; Chatzimilioudis G., 2012, CROWDSOURCING SMARTP, P; Chessa S, 2016, IEEE COMMUN MAG, V54, P108, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2016.750938; Christaki E, 2015, VIRULENCE, V6, P554, DOI 10.1080/21505594.2015.104097; Dutta J, 2016, IEEE SENSO; Edoh TO, 2011, J MED SYST, V35, P1123, DOI 10.1007/s10916-011-9717-; Gidel S., 2008, PEDESTRIAN DETECTION, P2; Gong YM, 2016, IEEE ACM T COMPUT BI, V13, P431, DOI 10.1109/TCBB.2016.251561; Istepanian RSH, 2011, IEEE ENG MED BIO, P5264, DOI 10.1109/IEMBS.2011.609130; Moron MJ, 2014, SENSORS-BASEL, V14, P575, DOI 10.3390/s14010057; Kos A., 2016, SENSORS SWITZERLAND, V1; Liu J., 2016, 2016 25 INT C COMP ; Liu S, 2007, J INF SCI ENG, V23, P27; Majethia R, 2015, INT CONF COMMUN SYS; Marika P., 2012, SENSORS SIGNAL PROCE, V; Nanda H, 2002, IV'2002: IEEE INTELLIGENT VEHICLE SYMPOSIUM, PROCEEDINGS, P1; National Instruments, 2016, FUND FIB BRAGG GRA; Pesko M, 2014, WIRELESS PERS COMMUN, V78, P1811, DOI 10.1007/s11277-014-1908-; Soto MA, 2010, OPT LETT, V35, P259, DOI 10.1364/OL.35.00025; Terry N., 2016, SSRN ELECT J, P2; Van Hoe B, 2012, SENSORS-BASEL, V12, P12052, DOI 10.3390/s12091205; W.

About 8.8% of the world was diabetic in 2017. It is projected that this will reach nearly 10% by 2045. The major challenge is that when machine learning-based classifiers are applied to such data sets for risk stratification, leads to lower performance. Thus, our objective is to develop an optimized and robust machine learning (ML) system under the assumption that missing values or outliers if replaced by a median configuration will yield higher risk stratification accuracy. This ML-based risk stratification is designed, optimized and evaluated, where: (i) the features are extracted and optimized from the six feature selection techniques (random forest, logistic regression, mutual information, principal component analysis, analysis of variance, and Fisher discriminant ratio) and combined with ten different types of classifiers (linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, naive Bayes, Gaussian process classification, support vector machine, artificial neural network, Adaboost, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest) under the hypothesis that both missing values and outliers when replaced by computed medians will improve the risk stratification accuracy. Pima Indian diabetic dataset (768 patients: 268 diabetic and 500 controls) was used. Our results demonstrate that on replacing the missing values and outliers by group median and median values, respectively and further using the combination of random forest feature selection and random forest classification technique yields an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and area under the curve as: 92.26%, 95.96%, 79.72%, 91.14%, 91.20%, and 0.93, respectively. This is an improvement of 10% over previously developed techniques published in literature. The system was validated for its stability and reliability. RF-based model showed the best performance when outliers are replaced by median values.","[Maniruzzaman, Md; Rahman, Md Jahanur] Univ Rajshahi, Dept Stat, Rajshahi, Bangladesh; [Maniruzzaman, Md] Johns Hopkins Univ, JiVitA Project, Gaibandha, Bangladesh; [Al-MehediHasan, Md] Rajshahi Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Rajshahi, Bangladesh; [Suri, Harman S.] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Abedin, Md Menhazul] Khulna Univ, Stat Discipline, Khulna, Bangladesh; [El-Baz, Ayman] Univ Louisville, Dept Bioengn, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Suri, Jasjit S.] AtheroPoint LLC, Stroke Monitoring & Diagnost Div, Roseville, CA 95661 USA; [Suri, Jasjit S.] Global Biomed Technol, Knowledge Engn Ctr, Roseville, CA 95741 USA","Suri, JS (corresponding author), AtheroPoint LLC, Stroke Monitoring & Diagnost Div, Roseville, CA 95661 USA.;Suri, JS (corresponding author), Global Biomed Technol, Knowledge Engn Ctr, Roseville, CA 95741 USA.",jasjit.suri@atheropoint.com,"Maniruzzaman, Md/R-2123-2019; El-Baz, Ayman/AAC-6689-2019","Maniruzzaman, Md/0000-0001-6151-8071; El-Baz, Ayman/0000-0001-7264-1323",,,"Acharya UR, 2012, BIOMED SIGNAL PROCES, V7, P401, DOI 10.1016/j.bspc.2011.07.00; Amer Diabet Assoc, 2014, DIABETES CARE, V37, pS81, DOI 10.2337/dc14-S08; [Anonymous], 2013, RETURN ADABOOST MH ; [Anonymous], 2015, INT J APPL SC; Baneshi MR, 2012, IRAN RED CRESCENT ME, V14, P3; Barakat NH, 2010, IEEE T INF TECHNOL B, V14, P1114, DOI 10.1109/TITB.2009.203948; Bashir S, 2016, J BIOMED INFORM, V59, P185, DOI 10.1016/j.jbi.2015.12.00; Bharath C., 2017, BRAZILIAN DENT SCI, V20, P9; Bozkurt MR, 2014, TURK J ELECTR ENG CO, V22, P1044, DOI 10.3906/elk-1209-8; Brahim-Belhouari S, 2004, COMPUT STAT DATA AN, V47, P705, DOI 10.1016/j.csda.2004.02.00; Breiman L, 2001, MACH LEARN, V45, P5, DOI 10.1023/A:101093340432; Canadian Diabetes Association, 2013, DIAB CAN TIPP POIN; Chitra R., 2013, INT J ENG RES APPL, V3, P179; Cokluk O, 2011, KURAM UYGUL EGIT BIL, V11, P30; CORTES C, 1995, MACH LEARN, V20, P273, DOI 10.1023/A:102262741141; COVER TM, 1965, IEEE TRANS ELECTRON, VEC14, P326, DOI 10.1109/PGEC.1965.26413; Danaei G, 2011, LANCET, V378, P31, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60679-; Fitzmaurice C, 2017, JAMA ONCOL, V3, P524, DOI 10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.568; Hasan M.

It determines how an individual thinks, feels and handle situations. Positive mental health helps one to work productively and realize their full potential. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Many factors contribute to mental health problems which lead to mental illness like stress, social anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, drug addiction, and personality disorders. It is becoming increasingly important to determine the onset of the mental illness to maintain proper life balance. The nature of machine learning algorithms and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be fully harnessed for predicting the onset of mental illness. Such applications when implemented in real time will benefit the society by serving as a monitoring tool for individuals with deviant behavior. This research work proposes to apply various machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, decision trees, naive bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbor classifier and logistic regression to identify state of mental health in a target group. The responses obtained from the target group for the designed questionnaire were first subject to unsupervised learning techniques. The labels obtained as a result of clustering were validated by computing the Mean Opinion Score. These cluster labels were then used to build classifiers to predict the mental health of an individual. Population from various groups like high school students, college students and working professionals were considered as target groups. The research presents an analysis of applying the aforementioned machine learning algorithms on the target groups and also suggests directions for future work.","[Srividya, M.; Mohanavalli, S.; Bhalaji, N.] SSN Coll Engn, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India","Mohanavalli, S (corresponding author), SSN Coll Engn, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.",srividhyav@ssn.edu.in; mohanas@ssn.edu.in; bhalajin@ssn.edu.in,"S, Mohanavalli/ABC-6985-2021; natarajan, bhalaji/G-3845-2013","natarajan, bhalaji/0000-0002-2991-3669",,,"Aborokbah M.

Physical analysis of blood tests to recognize leukocytes is tedious, time-consuming and liable to error because of the various morphological components of the cells. Segmentation of medical imagery has been considered as a difficult task because of complexity of images, and also due to the non-availability of leucocytes models which entirely captures the probable shapes in each structures and also incorporate cell overlapping, the expansive variety of the blood cells concerning their shape and size, various elements influencing the outer appearance of the blood leucocytes, and low Static Microscope Image disparity from extra issues outcoming about because of noise. We suggest a strategy towards segmentation of blood leucocytes using static microscope images which is a resultant of three prevailing systems of computer vision fiction: enhancing the image, Support vector machine for segmenting the image, and filtering out non ROI (region of interest) on the basis of Local binary patterns and texture features. Every one of these strategies are modified for blood leucocytes division issue, in this manner the subsequent techniques are very vigorous when compared with its individual segments. Eventually, we assess framework based by compare the outcome and manual division. The findings outcome from this study have shown a new approach that automatically segments the blood leucocytes and identify it from a static microscope images. Initially, the method uses a trainable segmentation procedure and trained support vector machine classifier to accurately identify the position of the ROI. After that, filtering out non ROI have proposed based on histogram analysis to avoid the non ROI and chose the right object. Finally, identify the blood leucocytes type using the texture feature. The performance of the foreseen approach has been tried in appearing differently in relation to the system against manual examination by a gynaecologist utilizing diverse scales. A total of 100 microscope images were used for the comparison, and the results showed that the proposed solution is a viable alternative to the manual segmentation method for accurately determining the ROI. We have evaluated the blood leucocytes identification using the ROI texture (LBP Feature). The identification accuracy in the technique used is about 95.3%., with 100 sensitivity and 91.66% specificity.","[Abdulhay, Enas] Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Irbid, Jordan; [Mohammed, Mazin Abed] Univ Tekn Malaysia Melaka, Fac Informat & Commun Technol, Biomed Comp & Engn Technol BIOCORE Appl Res Grp, Durian Tunggal, Malaysia; [Mohammed, Mazin Abed; Ibrahim, Dheyaa Ahmed] Univ Anbar, Univ Headquarter, Planning & Follow Dept, Anbar, Iraq; [Arunkumar, N.; Venkatraman, V.] Sastra Univ, Thanjavur, India","Abdulhay, E (corresponding author), Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Irbid, Jordan.",ewabdulhay@just.edu.jo; mazin_top_86@yahoo.com; dheyaa.ibrahim88@gmail.com; arun.nura@gmail.com; mathvvr@maths.sastra.edu,"Mohammed, Mazin Abed/E-3910-2018; N, Arunkumar/S-3028-2018; Venkatachalam, Venkataraman/AAG-4422-2019; IbrahiM, Dheyaa Ahmed/AAX-8483-2021","Mohammed, Mazin Abed/0000-0001-9030-8102; Venkatachalam, Venkataraman/0000-0001-6207-6308; ",,,"Abdel-Basset M, 2017, J MED SYST, V41, DOI 10.1007/s10916-017-0846-; Adollah R, 2008, IFMBE PROC, V21, P14; Bikhet SF, 2000, INT CONF ACOUST SPEE, P2259, DOI 10.1109/ICASSP.2000.85928; Binder T, 1999, ULTRASOUND MED BIOL, V25, P1069, DOI 10.1016/S0301-5629(99)00059-; Chan HP, 1998, MED PHYS, V25, P2007, DOI 10.1118/1.59838; GHANI M.K.A., 2017, J THEORETICAL APPL I, V9; Habibzadeh Mehdi, 2014, Artificial Neural Networks in Pattern Recognition. 6th IAPR TC 3 International Workshop, ANNPR 2014.

The present research aimed to study the effect of combat stress in strength manifestations of leg flexor-extensor muscles and the anaerobic metabolism of soldiers. Before and after asymmetrical combat simulation were analyzed parameters of blood lactate concentration, explosive leg strength manifestation and contractile capacity of leg muscle in 186 professional soldiers. Results showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in blood lactate values (2.23 +/- 0.95 vs 7.47 +/- 3.67 mmol/L), explosive leg strength (Squat Jump 0.31 +/- 0.06 vs 0.35 +/- 0.07 m, Countermovement Jump 0.33 +/- 0.07 vs 0.36 +/- 0.07 m, Abalakov Jump 0.39 +/- 0.08 vs 0.41 +/- 0.09 m), and a significant decrease of the elastic capacity (0.022 +/- 0.04 vs 0.021 +/- 0.04) and recruitment and muscle synchronization capability (0.028 +/- 0.04 vs 0.026 +/- 0.04). This data suggest that combat stress increases the leg strength manifestation despite the significantly increase of muscle acidosis after a combat simulation. This result is probably due to the high activation of the fight-flight system of soldiers which increases the organic response of soldiers and that can compensate the prejudicial effect of acidosis in muscle contraction. These results could be used by officers to improve specific training programs and to improve planning and election of equipment and material for the development of different missions in current theaters of operations.","[Delgado-Moreno, Rosa; Juan Robles-Perez, Jose; Javier Clemente-Suarez, Vicente] Ctr Higher Studies Appl Combat, Toledo, Spain; [Delgado-Moreno, Rosa; Aznar, Susana] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Sports Sci, PAFS Res Grp, Toledo, Spain; [Juan Robles-Perez, Jose] Light Forces Head Quarter Spanish Army, Madrid, Spain; [Javier Clemente-Suarez, Vicente] European Univ Madrid, Appl Psychophysiol Res Grp, Madrid, Spain; [Javier Clemente-Suarez, Vicente] Fac Sport Sci, Dept Motr Human Performance & Sport Management, Calle Tajo S-N, Madrid 28670, Spain","Clemente-Suarez, VJ (corresponding author), Ctr Higher Studies Appl Combat, Toledo, Spain.;Clemente-Suarez, VJ (corresponding author), European Univ Madrid, Appl Psychophysiol Res Grp, Madrid, Spain.;Clemente-Suarez, VJ (corresponding author), Fac Sport Sci, Dept Motr Human Performance & Sport Management, Calle Tajo S-N, Madrid 28670, Spain.",vctxente@yahoo.es,"Aznar, Susana/AAD-9999-2021; Clemente-Suarez, Vicente Javier/K-7980-2014","Clemente-Suarez, Vicente Javier/0000-0002-2397-2801",,,"Aguirre-Puig J.

An evaluation matrix is used for emergency evaluation and large-scale data scoring of patients with chronic heart diseases in telemedicine environment. However, one major problem in the emergency evaluation of these patients is establishing a reasonable threshold for patients with the most and least critical conditions. This threshold can be used to detect the highest and lowest priority levels when all the scores of patients are identical during disasters and peak seasons. A practical study was performed on 500 patients with chronic heart diseases and different symptoms, and their emergency levels were evaluated based on four main measurements: electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation sensor, blood pressure monitoring, and non-sensory measurement tool, namely, text frame. Data alignment was conducted for the raw data and decision-making matrix by converting each extracted feature into an integer. This integer represents their state in the triage level based on medical guidelines to determine the features from different sources in a platform. The patients were then scored based on a decision matrix by using multi-criteria decision-making techniques, namely, integrated multi-layer for analytic hierarchy process (MLAHP) and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). For subjective validation, cardiologists were consulted to confirm the ranking results. For objective validation, mean +/- standard deviation was computed to check the accuracy of the systematic ranking. This study provides scenarios and checklist benchmarking to evaluate the proposed and existing prioritization methods. Experimental results revealed the following. (1) The integration of TOPSIS and MLAHP effectively and systematically solved the patient settings on triage and prioritization problems. (2) In subjective validation, the first five patients assigned to the doctors were the most urgent cases that required the highest priority, whereas the last five patients were the least urgent cases and were given the lowest priority. In objective validation, scores significantly differed between the groups, indicating that the ranking results were identical. (3) For the first, second, and third scenarios, the proposed method exhibited an advantage over the benchmark method with percentages of 40%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. In conclusion, patients with the most and least urgent cases received the highest and lowest priority levels, respectively.","[Kalid, Naser; Zaidan, A. A.; Zaidan, B. B.; Hashim, M.; Albahri, O.

Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) act as the source for the development of classification system. The extraction, identification and segmentation of infected region from Magnetic Resonance (MR) brain image is significant concern but a dreary and time-consuming task performed by radiologists or clinical experts, and the final classification accuracy depends on their experience only. To overcome these limitations, it is necessary to use computer-aided techniques. To improve the efficiency of classification accuracy and reduce the recognition complexity involves in the medical image segmentation process, we have proposed Threshold Based Region Optimization (TBRO) based brain tumor segmentation. The experimental results of proposed technique have been evaluated and validated for classification performance on magnetic resonance brain images, based on accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The experimental results achieved 96.57% accuracy, 94.6% specificity, and 97.76% sensitivity, shows the improvement in classifying normal and abnormal tissues among given images. Detection, extraction and classification of tumor from MRI scan images of the brain is done by using MATLAB software.","[Kanmani, P.] Sri Ramakrishna Inst Technol, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Marikkannu, P.] Anna Univ, Reg Ctr, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India","Kanmani, P (corresponding author), Sri Ramakrishna Inst Technol, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.",mailme.kanmani@gmail.com,"P, Kanmani/AAE-3607-2020","P, Kanmani/0000-0002-0715-6011; P, Marikkannu/0000-0002-9590-4541",,,"A Javadpour, 2016, J Biomed Phys Eng, V6, P9; Abdel-Basset M, 2017, J MED SYST, V41, DOI 10.1007/s10916-017-0846-; Aly M., 2006, TECHNICAL REPOR; Anitha V, 2016, IET COMPUT VIS, V10, P9, DOI 10.1049/iet-cvi.2014.019; [Anonymous], 2016, EGYPT COMPUT SCI ; Bahadure NB, 2017, INT J BIOMED IMAGING, V2017, DOI 10.1155/2017/974910; Boberek M., IMAGE PROCESS COMMUN, P33; Cong Shi J.

This paper proposes a support vector using fusion estimator with a bootstrap technique for oscillometric blood pressure (BP) estimation. However, some inherent problems exist with this approach. First, it is not simple to identify the best support vector regression (SVR) estimator, and worthy information might be omitted when selecting one SVR estimator and discarding others. Additionally, our input feature data, acquired from only five BP measurements per subject, represent a very small sample size. This constitutes a critical limitation when utilizing the SVR technique and can cause overfitting or underfitting, depending on the structure of the algorithm. To overcome these challenges, a fusion with an asymptotic approach (based on combining the bootstrap with the SVR technique) is utilized to generate the pseudo features needed to predict the BP values. This ensemble estimator using the SVR technique can learn to effectively mimic the non-linear relations between the input data acquired from the oscillometry and the nurse's BPs.","[Lee, Soojeong] Hanyang Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 133791, South Korea; [Ahmad, Awais] Yeungnam Univ, Dept Informat & Commun Engn, Gyeongbuk 38541, South Korea; [Jeon, Gwanggil] Incheon Natl Univ, Coll Informat Technol, Dept Embedded Syst Engn, 119 Acad Ro, Incheon 22012, South Korea","Lee, S (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 133791, South Korea.;Jeon, G (corresponding author), Incheon Natl Univ, Coll Informat Technol, Dept Embedded Syst Engn, 119 Acad Ro, Incheon 22012, South Korea.",leesoo86@hanyang.ac.kr; awais@ynu.ac.kr; gjeon@inu.ac.kr,"Ahmad, Awais/AAA-4504-2019",,"NRF Grant - Korean Government [2016R1D1A1B03932925, 2015R1D1A1A01058171]",This work was supported by the NRF Grant funded by the Korean Government 2016R1D1A1B03932925 and 2015R1D1A1A01058171.,"Aborokbah M.

The objective of this research was to analyze the psycho-physiological response and specific motor skills in an urban combat simulation with two units of infantry with different training and experience. Material and Methods: psychophysiological parameters-Heart Rate, blood oxygen saturation, glucose and blood lactate, cortical activation, anxiety and heart rate variability-, as well as fine motor skills were analyzed in 31 male soldiers of the Spanish Army, 19 belonging to the Light Infantry Brigade, and 12 to the Heavy Forces Infantry Brigade, before and after an urban combat simulation. Results and Conclusion: A combat simulation provokes an alteration of the psycho-physiological basal state in soldiers and a great unbalance in the sympathetic-vagal interaction. The specific training of Light Infantry unit involves lower metabolic, cardiovascular, and anxiogenic response not only previous, but mainly after a combat maneuver, than Heavy Infantry unit's. No differences were found in relation with fine motor skills, improving in both cases after the maneuver. This fact should be taken into account for betterment units' deployment preparation in current theaters of operations.","[Sanchez-Molina, Joaquin; Clemente-Suarez, Vicente J.] Univ Europea Madrid, Fac Sport Sci, Tajo St S-N, Madrid 28670, Spain; [Robles-Perez, Jose J.; Clemente-Suarez, Vicente J.] Studies Ctr Appl Combat CESCA, Toledo, Spain; [Robles-Perez, Jose J.] Spanish Army, Light Forces Head Quarter, Madrid, Spain; [Clemente-Suarez, Vicente J.] Univ Costa, Grp Invest Cultura Educ & Soc, Barranquilla, Colombia","Clemente-Suarez, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Europea Madrid, Fac Sport Sci, Tajo St S-N, Madrid 28670, Spain.;Clemente-Suarez, VJ (corresponding author), Studies Ctr Appl Combat CESCA, Toledo, Spain.;Clemente-Suarez, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Costa, Grp Invest Cultura Educ & Soc, Barranquilla, Colombia.",vctxente@yahoo.es,"Clemente-Suarez, Vicente Javier/K-7980-2014","Clemente-Suarez, Vicente Javier/0000-0002-2397-2801; Sanchez-Molina, Joaquin/0000-0002-9801-0981",,,"Andersen JP, 2016, SAGE OPEN, V6, DOI 10.1177/215824401663870; Arnetz BB, 2013, INT ARCH OCC ENV HEA, V86, P79, DOI 10.1007/s00420-012-0748-; Arnetz BB, 2009, J POLICE CRIM PSYCHO, V24, P1, DOI 10.1007/s11896-008-9030-; Arruda AFS, 2017, PHYSIOL BEHAV, V177, P291, DOI 10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.05.01; Aubert AE, 2003, SPORTS MED, V33, P889, DOI 10.2165/00007256-200333120-0000; Belinchon-deMiguel P, 2018, J MED SYST, V42, DOI 10.1007/s10916-017-0889-; Carter JB, 2003, MED SCI SPORT EXER, V35, P1333, DOI 10.1249/01.MSS.0000079046.01763.8; Clemente Suárez V.J., 2012, Sanid.

Indeed, traditional data warehousing frameworks can not be effective when managing the volume, variety, and velocity of current medical applications. As a result, several data warehouses face many issues over medical data and many challenges need to be addressed. New solutions have emerged and Hadoop is one of the best examples, it can be used to process these streams of medical data. However, without an efficient system design and architecture, these performances will not be significant and valuable for medical managers. In this paper, we provide a short review of the literature about research issues of traditional data warehouses and we present some important Hadoop-based data warehouses. In addition, a Hadoop-based architecture and a conceptual data model for designing medical Big Data warehouse are given. In our case study, we provide implementation detail of big data warehouse based on the proposed architecture and data model in the Apache Hadoop platform to ensure an optimal allocation of health resources.","[Sebaa, Abderrazak; Nouicer, Amina; Tari, AbdelKamel] Univ Bejaia, Fac Exact Sci, LIMED Lab, Bejaia, Algeria; [Chikh, Fatima] Univ Bejaia, Fac Exact Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Bejaia, Algeria","Sebaa, A (corresponding author), Univ Bejaia, Fac Exact Sci, LIMED Lab, Bejaia, Algeria.",balzak.sebaa@gmail.com,,"SEBAA, ABDERRAZAK/0000-0002-8742-1240","Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research of Algeria; University of Bejaia, under the project CNEPRU [B*00620140066/2015-2018]","This work was partially supported by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research of Algeria and the University of Bejaia, under the project CNEPRU (Ref.

Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is a process that provides a framework for image search and low-level visual features are commonly used to retrieve the images from the image database. The basic requirement in any image retrieval process is to sort the images with a close similarity in term of visually appearance. The color, shape and texture are the examples of low-level image features. The feature plays a significant role in image processing. The powerful representation of an image is known as feature vector and feature extraction techniques are applied to get features that will be useful in classifying and recognition of images. As features define the behavior of an image, they show its place in terms of storage taken, efficiency in classification and obviously in time consumption also. In this paper, we are going to discuss various types of features, feature extraction techniques and explaining in what scenario, which features extraction technique will be better. The effectiveness of the CBIR approach is fundamentally based on feature extraction. In image processing errands like object recognition and image retrieval feature descriptor is an immense among the most essential step. The main idea of CBIR is that it can search related images to an image passed as query from a dataset got by using distance metrics. The proposed method is explained for image retrieval constructed on YCbCr color with canny edge histogram and discrete wavelet transform. The combination of edge of histogram and discrete wavelet transform increase the performance of image retrieval framework for content based search. The execution of different wavelets is additionally contrasted with discover the suitability of specific wavelet work for image retrieval. The proposed algorithm is prepared and tried to implement for Wang image database. For Image Retrieval Purpose, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is used and applied on standard dataset in CBIR domain.

Hence, a rehabilitation process can be planned according to the determination of degrees as a later work. As envisaged, in full face transplant cases, the determination of expressions can be confused or cannot be achieved as the healthy control group. In order to perform image-based analysis, a control group consist of 9 healthy males and 2 full-face transplant patients participated in the study. Appearance-based Gabor Wavelet Transform (GWT) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) methods are adopted for recognizing neutral and 6 emotional expressions which consist of angry, scared, happy, hate, confused and sad. Feature extraction was carried out by using both methods and combination of these methods serially. In the performed expressions, the extracted features of the most distinct zones in the facial area where the eye and mouth region, have been used to classify the emotions. Also, the combination of these region features has been used to improve classifier performance. Control subjects and transplant patients' ability to perform emotional expressions have been determined with K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier with region-specific and method-specific decision stages. The results have been compared with healthy group. It has been observed that transplant patients don't reflect some emotional expressions. Also, there were confusions among expressions.","[Bedeloglu, Merve; Topcu, Cagdas; Akgul, Arzu; Doger, Ela Naz; Sever, Refik; Polat, Ovunc; Colak, Omer Halil] Akdeniz Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Fac Engn, Antalya, Turkey; [Ozkan, Ozlenen; Ozkan, Omer] Akdeniz Univ, Dept Plast & Reconstruct Surg, Fac Med, Antalya, Turkey; [Uysal, Hilmi] Akdeniz Univ, Dept Neurol, Fac Med, Antalya, Turkey","Colak, OH (corresponding author), Akdeniz Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Fac Engn, Antalya, Turkey.",omercol@akdeniz.edu.tr,"Polat, Ovunc/C-3078-2016; Uysal, Hilmi/C-3651-2016","Uysal, Hilmi/0000-0002-6063-377X; Topcu, Cagdas/0000-0002-7504-0192",TUBITAK [113E182],This study was supported by TUBITAK (Project Number: 113E182).,"Bartlett M.S., 2003, P 2003 C COMP VIS PA, P53, DOI [10.1109/cvprw.2003.10057, DOI 10.1109/CVPRW.2003.10057; Bedeloglu M., 2016, THESI; Bedeloglu M., 2015, TIPTEKNO2015, P; Chao W., Wei-lun Chao, Patent No. [R989420 73, 98942073; DUCHENNE B, 1862, MECANISME PHYSIONOM; EKMAN P, 1971, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V17, P124, DOI 10.1037/h003037; Ekman P., 2005, HDB COGNITION EMOTIO, P45, DOI 10.1002/0470013494.ch; Ekman R., 1997, WHAT FACE REVEALS B; Feng X., 2004, IMAGE ANAL RECOGNIT; Haghighat M., 2013, IDENTIFICATION USIN; Huang D, 2011, IEEE T SYST MAN CY C, V41, P765, DOI 10.1109/TSMCC.2011.211875; Meshgini S., 2012, INT J COMPUTER THEOR, V4, P767, DOI [10.7763/IJCTE.2012.V4.574, DOI 10.7763/IJCTE.2012.V4.574; Nagarajan R, 2012, J MED SYST, V36, P2225, DOI 10.1007/s10916-011-9690-; Neth D, 2010, VISION RES, V50, P1693, DOI 10.1016/j.visres.2010.05.02; Ojala T, 1996, PATTERN RECOGN, V29, P51, DOI 10.1016/0031-3203(95)00067-; Ojala T, 2002, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V24, P971, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.2002.101762; Shan Caifeng, 2005, P IEEE INT C IM PROC, V2, pI; Shen L, 2007, IMAGE VISION COMPUT, V25, P553, DOI 10.1016/j.imavis.2006.05.00; Singh R, 2008, PATTERN RECOGN, V41, P880, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2007.06.02; Tian Y., 2004, P IEEE C COMP VIS PA, P82, DOI DOI 10.1109/CVPR.2004.33; Tian YL, 2005, HANDBOOK OF FACE RECOGNITION, P247, DOI 10.1007/0-387-27257-7_1; Uysal H., 2016, CLIN NEUROPHYSIO; Zhang WC, 2005, IEEE I CONF COMP VIS, P78",23,5,5,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

New manufacturing techniques and the new materials can help to modernize this treatment method of fractures. The use of Additive Manufacturing has been proposed in recent years as an alternative process for the manufacture of splints and there has been an increase in public awareness and exploration. For this reason, in this study a splint model printed in 3D, that replaces the deficiencies of the cast maintaining its virtues, has been proposed. The proposed methodology is based on three-dimensional digitalization techniques and 3D modeling with reverse engineering software. The work integrates different scientific disciplines to achieve its main goal: to improve life quality of the patient. In addition, the splint has been designed based on the principles of sustainable development. The design of splint is made of Polycarbonate by technique of Additive Manufacturing with fused deposition manufacturing, and conceived with organic shapes, customizing openings and closing buttons with rubber. In this preliminary study the final result is a prototype of the 3D printed arm splint in a reduced scale by using PLA as material.","[Blaya, Fernando; San Pedro, Pilar; Lopez Silva, Julia; D'Amato, Roberto] Univ Politecn Madrid, Ronda Valencia 3, Madrid 28012, Spain; [Soriano Heras, Enrique] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Av Univ 30, Madrid 28911, Spain; [Antonio Juanes, Juan] Univ Salamanca, Campus Miguel Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain","D'Amato, R (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Ronda Valencia 3, Madrid 28012, Spain.",fernando.blaya@upm.es; pilarsanpedro@yahoo.es; julia.lsilva@alumnos.upm.es; r.damato@upm.es; esoriano@ing.uc3m.es; jajm@usal.es,"Juanes Méndez, Juan Antonio/D-8675-2018; Heras, Enrique Soriano/O-6126-2018; D'Amato, Roberto/L-9153-2014","Juanes Méndez, Juan Antonio/0000-0003-2749-3426; Heras, Enrique Soriano/0000-0003-3309-7518; D'Amato, Roberto/0000-0001-8090-922X",,,"3DMedScan AmphibianSkinTM, 2014, AMPHIBIANSKINT; Alessandro R, 2013, TRIBOL INT, V57, P156, DOI 10.1016/j.triboint.2012.06.02; [Anonymous], EX SYS; COOPER C, 1985, J ROY SOC MED, V78, P27; Curodeau A, 2000, J BIOMED MATER RES, V53, P525, DOI 10.1002/1097-4636(200009)53:5<525::AID-JBM12>3.0.CO;2-; D'Amato R., 2015, Case Studies in Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, V1, P8, DOI 10.1016/j.csmssp.2015.04.00; De Boer IG, 2008, DISABIL REHABIL, V30, P286, DOI 10.1080/0963828070125703; Dhanwal DK, 2011, INDIAN J ORTHOP, V45, P15, DOI 10.4103/0019-5413.7365; Evill J., CORTEX EVIL; HECKMAN JD, 1994, J BONE JOINT SURG AM, V76A, P26, DOI 10.2106/00004623-199401000-0000; Jarosz K., 2017, J MACHINE ENG, V17, P6; Karasahim D., OSTEOID MED CAST AT; Kelly S., 2015, P 2015 14 RAP DES P; Lee RJ, 2012, ORTHOPEDICS, V35, pE940, DOI 10.3928/01477447-20120525-3; Merola M, 2016, MEASUREMENT, V90, P365, DOI 10.1016/j.measurement.2016.05.00; O'Brien L, 2010, HAND THER, V15, P3, DOI 10.1258/ht.2009.00902; Open Bionics, 3D PRINT DUAL MAT M; Palousek D, 2014, RAPID PROTOTYPING J, V20, P27, DOI 10.1108/RPJ-03-2012-002; Paterson A.

In the case of musicians, such as violinists, who have long and daily training routines, the repetitive movements they performare forced and sometimes the postures are not natural. Therefore, this article aims to study and simulate the dynamic behavior of the glenohumeral joint under repetitive conditions that represent the different postures assumed by a violinist during his daily training. For this purpose, the criteria provided by the RULA (rapid upper limb assessment) method have been used. Subsequently, by using as a reference geometry that of the articulation under study generated and modeled in CATIA (R) [VERSION 5R21], a FEM analysis has been proposed with the software ANSYS (R) [VERSION 17.1] simulating the short and cyclic movements of the Humerus of the violinists. With the analysis carried out, thanks to linear and isotropic approximations of the joint, it has been possible to know the approximate dynamic behavior of tissues, muscles and tendons, and the response of the joint in terms of fatigue.","[Islan, Manuel; Blaya, Fernando; San Pedro, Pilar; D'Amato, Roberto; Lechosa Urquijo, Emilio] Univ Politecn Madrid, Ronda Valencia 3, Madrid 28012, ES, Spain; [Antonio Juanes, Juan] Univ Salamanca, Campus Miguel Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, ES, Spain","D'Amato, R (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Ronda Valencia 3, Madrid 28012, ES, Spain.",manuel.islan.marcos@upm.es; fernando.blaya@upm.es; pilarsanpedro@yahoo.es; r.damato@upm.es; emilio.lechosa@upm.es; jajm@usal.es,"D'Amato, Roberto/L-9153-2014; Juanes Méndez, Juan Antonio/D-8675-2018","D'Amato, Roberto/0000-0001-8090-922X; Juanes Méndez, Juan Antonio/0000-0003-2749-3426",,,"Alessandro R, 2013, TRIBOL INT, V57, P156, DOI 10.1016/j.triboint.2012.06.02; ALLMAN FL, 1967, J BONE JOINT SURG AM, VA 49, P774, DOI 10.2106/00004623-196749040-0002; [Anonymous], 2017, CES EDU PACK GRANT; Brunelli MP, 2002, ORTHOP CLIN N AM, V33, P497, DOI 10.1016/S0030-5898(02)00011-; Calle Y., 2014, CES MOVIMIENTO SALUD, V; Chen EJ, 1996, IEEE T ULTRASON FERR, V43, P191, DOI 10.1109/58.48447; Cheng PL, 2006, J BIOMECH, V39, P1201, DOI 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2005.03.01; D'Amato R., 2015, Case Studies in Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, V1, P8, DOI 10.1016/j.csmssp.2015.04.00; David G.

Therefore, we aimed to assess the frequency and impact of adverse events among inpatients. We analysed an administrative database containing a registration of all hospitalisations occurring in Portuguese public hospitals between 2000 and 2015. We identified all episodes with a registration of adverse events, and classified them into three categories, namely (1) misadventures of surgical and medical care, (2) complications of surgical or medical procedures, and (3) adverse drug events (including adverse drug reactions, poisoning events, and late effects). These episodes were compared over their length of stay, in-hospital mortality, and hospital costs with an equal number of hospitalisations matched for patients' and episodes' characteristics. Between 2000 and 2015, 5.8% (n = 861,372) of all Portuguese hospitalisations had a registration of at least one adverse event. Hospitalisations with registration of adverse events had a median length of stay of 8 days, median hospitalisation costs of 3060.7 Euro, and an in-hospital mortality of 6.7%. Hospitalisations with registration of misadventures of care, complications of procedures and adverse drug reactions had significantly higher lengths of stay and hospitalisation costs than their matched controls. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher for episodes of misadventures of care and complications of procedures, but lower for adverse drug events hospitalisations. Therefore, adverse events are common among inpatients, and have an important clinical and economic impact. Administrative databases may be useful in their epidemiological assessment.","[Sousa-Pinto, Bernardo; Marques, Bernardo; Lopes, Fernando; Freitas, Alberto] Univ Porto, MEDCIDS Dept Community Med Informat & Hlth Decis, Fac Med, Rua Dr Placido Costa, P-4200450 Oporto, Portugal; [Sousa-Pinto, Bernardo; Marques, Bernardo; Lopes, Fernando; Freitas, Alberto] CINTESIS Ctr Hlth Technol & Serv Res, Rua Dr Placida Costa, P-4200450 Oporto, Portugal","Freitas, A (corresponding author), Univ Porto, MEDCIDS Dept Community Med Informat & Hlth Decis, Fac Med, Rua Dr Placido Costa, P-4200450 Oporto, Portugal.;Freitas, A (corresponding author), CINTESIS Ctr Hlth Technol & Serv Res, Rua Dr Placida Costa, P-4200450 Oporto, Portugal.",alberto@med.up.pt,"Freitas, Alberto/C-1972-2012; Sousa-Pinto, Bernardo/O-2846-2014; Freitas, Alberto/AAH-3193-2019","Freitas, Alberto/0000-0003-2113-9653; Sousa-Pinto, Bernardo/0000-0002-1277-3401; Freitas, Alberto/0000-0003-2113-9653; Lopes, Fernando/0000-0002-2278-2264","North Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE), under the PORTUGAL Partnership Agreement [NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000016]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)","The authors wish to thank the project NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000016 (NanoSTIMA), financed by the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, and through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); the project had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

However, the ever-increasing volume of images hinder performance of image retrieval systems. Recently, features from deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have yielded state-of-the-art performance in image retrieval. Further, locality sensitive hashing based approaches have become popular for their ability to allow efficient retrieval in large scale datasets. In this paper, we present a highly efficient method to compress selective convolutional features into sequence of bits using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Firstly, highly reactive convolutional feature maps from a pre-trained CNN are identified for medical images based on their neuronal responses using optimal subset selection algorithm. Then, layer-wise global mean activations of the selected feature maps are transformed into compact binary codes using binarization of its Fourier spectrum. The acquired hash codes are highly discriminative and can be obtained efficiently from the original feature vectors without any training. The proposed framework has been evaluated on two large datasets of radiology and endoscopy images.

The real-time remote monitoring of patients is an important issue in telemedicine. In the provision of healthcare services, patient prioritisation poses a significant challenge because of the complex decision-making process it involves when patients are considered 'big data'. To our knowledge, no study has highlighted the link between 'big data' characteristics and real-time remote healthcare monitoring in the patient prioritisation process, as well as the inherent challenges involved. Thus, we present comprehensive insights into the elements of big data characteristics according to the six 'Vs': volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value and variability. Each of these elements is presented and connected to a related part in the study of the connection between patient prioritisation and realtime remote healthcare monitoring systems. Then, we determine the weak points and recommend solutions as potential future work. This study makes the following contributions. (1) The link between big data characteristics and real-time remote healthcare monitoring in the patient prioritisation process is described. (2) The open issues and challenges for big data used in the patient prioritisation process are emphasised. (3) As a recommended solution, decision making using multiple criteria, such as vital signs and chief complaints, is utilised to prioritise the big data of patients with chronic diseases on the basis of the most urgent cases.","[Kalid, Naser; Zaidan, A.

Jane; Lee, Tim K.",,,A Computer-Aided Decision Support System for Detection and Localization of Cutaneous Vasculature in Dermoscopy Images Via Deep Feature Learning,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Deep learning; Automated skin vessel detection; Dermoscopy; Stacked sparse autoencoders,SKIN-LESIONS; SEGMENTATION,"Vascular structures of skin are important biomarkers in diagnosis and assessment of cutaneous conditions. Presence and distribution of lesional vessels are associated with specific abnormalities. Therefore, detection and localization of cutaneous vessels provide critical information towards diagnosis and stage status of diseases. However, cutaneous vessels are highly variable in shape, size, color and architecture, which complicate the detection task. Considering the large variability of these structures, conventional vessel detection techniques lack the generalizability to detect different vessel types and require separate algorithms to be designed for each type. Furthermore, such techniques are highly dependent on precise hand-crafted features which are time-consuming and computationally inefficient. As a solution, we propose a data-driven feature learning framework based on stacked sparse auto-encoders (SSAE) for comprehensive detection of cutaneous vessels. Each training image is divided into small patches of either containing or non-containing vasculature. A multilayer SSAE is designed to learn hidden features of the data in hierarchical layers in an unsupervised manner. The high-level learned features are subsequently fed into a classifier which categorizes each patch into absence or presence of vasculature and localizes vessels within the lesion. Over a test set of 3095 patches derived from 200 images, the proposed framework demonstrated superior performance of 95.4% detection accuracy over a variety of vessel patterns; outperforming other techniques by achieving the highest positive predictive value of 94.7%. The proposed Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) framework can serve as a decision support system assisting dermatologists for more accurate diagnosis, especially in teledermatology applications in remote areas.","[Kharazmi, Pegah; Lee, Tim K.] Univ British Columbia, Biomed Engn Program, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Zheng, Jiannan; Wang, Z.

As adduced by world health organization, technological proceeds in the field of cardiac function assessment have become the nucleus and heart of all leading research studies in CVDs in which electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is the most functional and convenient tool used to test the range of heart-related irregularities. Most of the approaches present in the literature of ECG signal analysis consider noise removal, rhythm-based analysis, and heartbeat detection to improve the performance of a cardiac pacemaker. Advancements achieved in the field of ECG segments detection and beat classification have a limited evaluation and still require clinical approvals. In this paper, approaches on techniques to implement on-chip ECG detector for a cardiac pacemaker system are discussed. Moreover, different challenges regarding the ECG signal morphology analysis deriving from medical literature is extensively reviewed. It is found that robustness to noise, wavelet parameter choice, numerical efficiency, and detection performance are essential performance indicators required by a state-of-the-art ECG detector. Furthermore, many algorithms described in the existing literature are not verified using ECG data from the standard databases. Some ECG detection algorithms show very high detection performance with the total number of detected QRS complexes. However, the high detection performance of the algorithm is verified using only a few datasets. Finally, gaps in current advancements and testing are identified, and the primary challenge remains to be implementing bullseye test for morphology analysis evaluation.","[Kumar, Ashish; Komaragiri, Rama; Kumar, Manjeet] Bennett Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Gr Noida 201308, UP, India","Kumar, M (corresponding author), Bennett Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Gr Noida 201308, UP, India.",akumar.1june@gmail.com; rama.komaragiri@bennett.edu.in; manjeetchhillar@gmail.com,"Komaragiri, Rama/AAH-8327-2020; Kumar, Ashish/ABI-8377-2020; Kumar, Manjeet/K-1325-2015","Komaragiri, Rama/0000-0002-0468-8506; Kumar, Ashish/0000-0002-8413-1192; Kumar, Manjeet/0000-0001-6578-9741",,,"Afonso VX, 1999, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V46, P192, DOI 10.1109/10.74088; Alesanco A, 2003, COMPUT CARDIOL, V30, P593, DOI 10.1109/CIC.2003.129122; American Heart Association, AHA DA; [Anonymous], 1998, ANSIAAMIEC5; Arrais E, 2016, IEEE LAT AM T, V14, P1662, DOI 10.1109/TLA.2016.748349; Baek HJ, 2012, IEEE T INF TECHNOL B, V16, P150, DOI 10.1109/TITB.2011.217574; Bahoura M, 1997, COMPUT METH PROG BIO, V52, P35, DOI 10.1016/S0169-2607(97)01780-; Banerjee S, 2014, IEEE T INSTRUM MEAS, V63, P326, DOI 10.1109/TIM.2013.227900; Barro S, 1998, IEEE ENG MED BIOL, V17, P45, DOI 10.1109/51.64622; Benmalek M, 2009, IET SIGNAL PROCESS, V3, P381, DOI 10.1049/iet-spr.2008.009; Bhavtosh, 2015, 2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING AND COMMUNICATION (ICSC), P204, DOI 10.1109/ICSPCom.2015.715064; Bono V, 2014, IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH, V18, P193, DOI 10.1109/JBHI.2013.226331; Boroujeny B.

This study had an interrupted time series design. The adherence to the guideline was assessed at fortnightly (two weeks) intervals from January 2016 to January 2017, 6 months before and 6 months after intervention. Newly diagnosed patients with AF were included in the offices of ten cardiologists. Stroke and major bleeding risks were calculated by the CDSS which was implemented via a mobile application. Treatment recommendations based on the guideline were shown to cardiologists. The segmented regression model was used to evaluate the effect of CDSS on level and trend of guideline adherence for the treatment of AF. In our analysis, 373 patients were included. The trend of adherence to the anticoagulation guideline for the treatment of AF was stable in the pre-intervention phase. After the CDSS intervention, mean of the adherence to the guideline significantly increased from 48% to 65.5% (P-value < 0.0001). The trend of adherence to the guideline was stable in the post-intervention phase. Our results showed that the CDSS can improve adherence to the anticoagulation guideline for the treatment of AF.

It is a challenging task due to diverse and complicated structures of cells. In this work, we present an automated technique for detection of cellular nuclei in hematoxylin and eosin stained histopathology images. Our proposed approach is based on kernelized correlation filters. Correlation filters have been widely used in object detection and tracking applications but their strength has not been explored in the medical imaging domain up till now. Our experimental results show that the proposed scheme gives state of the art accuracy and can learn complex nuclear morphologies. Like deep learning approaches, the proposed filters do not require engineering of image features as they can operate directly on histopathology images without significant preprocessing. However, unlike deep learning methods, the large-margin correlation filters developed in this work are interpretable, computationally efficient and do not require specialized or expensive computing hardware.

This paper has presented simulations and virtual inspections of BIRC3, BIRC6, CCL4, KLKB1 and CYP2A6 with their outputs and explanations, as well as brain segment intensity due to dancing. Our proposed MapReduce framework with the fusion algorithm can simulate medical imaging. The concept is very similar to the digital surface theories to simulate how biological units can get together to form bigger units, until the formation of the entire unit of biological subject. The M-Fusion and M-Update function by the fusion algorithm can achieve a good performance evaluation which can process and visualize up to 40 GB of data within 600 s. We conclude that computational intelligence can provide effective and efficient healthcare research offered by simulations and visualization.","[Chang, Victor] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Int Business Sch Suzhou, Suzhou, Peoples R China","Chang, V (corresponding author), Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Int Business Sch Suzhou, Suzhou, Peoples R China.",victorchang.research@gmail.com,"Chang, Victor/AAC-7582-2019","Chang, Victor/0000-0002-8012-5852",,,"[Anonymous], 2006, SWARM INTELL-U; Balkwill F, 2004, NAT REV CANCER, V4, P540, DOI 10.1038/nrc138; Bertrand G, 1999, J MATH IMAGING VIS, V11, P207, DOI 10.1023/A:100834831879; Chang V, 2017, KNOWL-BASED SYST, V127, P29, DOI 10.1016/j.knosys.2017.03.00; Chen L., P 2 AACM S SOL MOD A, P45; Civera J, 2010, J FIELD ROBOT, V27, P609, DOI 10.1002/rob.2034; Gentleman R, 2005, STAT APPL GENET MOL, V4, DOI 10.2202/1544-6115.103; Huang DD, 2015, IEEE T VIS COMPUT GR, V21, P420, DOI 10.1109/TVCG.2014.235988; KIM CE, 1983, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V5, P231, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.1983.476737; Klette G, 2004, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3322, P16; Klette G, 2006, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V4040, P3; Klette R., 2004, DIGITAL GEOMETR; Leblond F, 2010, J PHOTOCH PHOTOBIO B, V98, P77, DOI 10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2009.11.00; Lopez LM, 2012, NEUROBIOL AGING, V33, DOI 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2012.02.00; Malgouyres R, 1997, THEOR COMPUT SCI, V186, P1, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3975(96)00213-; Miyamoto M, 1999, BIOCHEM BIOPH RES CO, V261, P658, DOI 10.1006/bbrc.1999.108; Moreau ME, 2005, J PHARMACOL SCI, V99, P6, DOI 10.1254/jphs.SRJ05001; Pal SN, 2013, DRUG SAFETY, V36, P75, DOI 10.1007/s40264-012-0014-; Rose Nikolas, 2013, NEURO NEW BRAIN SC; Thorgeirsson TE, 2010, NAT GENET, V42, P448, DOI 10.1038/ng.57; Turner N, 2010, NAT REV CANCER, V10, P116, DOI 10.1038/nrc278; Weber GW, 2015, AM J PHYS ANTHROPOL, V156, P22, DOI 10.1002/ajpa.2265; Wong RSY, 2011, J EXP CLIN CANC RES, V30, DOI 10.1186/1756-9966-30-8; Zhang YH, 2017, REPROD BIOL ENDOCRIN, V15, P1, DOI 10.1186/s12958-017-0258-; Zhang YD, 2008, SCI CHINA SER F, V51, P2115, DOI 10.1007/s11432-008-0124-; Zhang YD, 2017, CNS NEUROL DISORD-DR, V16, P122, DOI 10.2174/187152731566616102611504; Zhang YD, 2017, J EXP THEOR ARTIF IN, V29, P299, DOI 10.1080/0952813X.2015.113227; Zhang YD, 2011, EXPERT SYST APPL, V38, P10049, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2011.02.01; Zhang YD, 2010, SCI CHINA INFORM SCI, V53, P1963, DOI 10.1007/s11432-010-4075-",29,26,26,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The purpose of cryptography is to transmit a message between a sender and receiver such that an eavesdropper is unable to comprehend it. To accomplish this, not only we need a strong algorithm, but a strong key and a strong concept for encryption and decryption process. We have introduced a concept of DNA Deep Learning Cryptography which is defined as a technique of concealing data in terms of DNA sequence and deep learning. In the cryptographic technique, each alphabet of a letter is converted into a different combination of the four bases, namely; Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G) and Thymine (T), which make up the human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Actual implementations with the DNA don't exceed laboratory level and are expensive. To bring DNA computing on a digital level, easy and effective algorithms are proposed in this paper. In proposed work we have introduced firstly, a method and its implementation for key generation based on the theory of natural selection using Genetic Algorithm with Needleman-Wunsch (NW) algorithm and Secondly, a method for implementation of encryption and decryption based on DNA computing using biological operations Transcription, Translation, DNA Sequencing and Deep Learning.","[Kalsi, Shruti; Kaur, Harleen] Jamia Hamdard, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Sch Engn Sci & Technol, New Delhi, India; [Kalsi, Shruti] Xerox Technol Ltd, 5th 6th Floor,Vatika Business Pk, Gurugram, Haryana, India; [Chang, Victor] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Int Business Sch Suzhou, Suzhou, Peoples R China","Kaur, H (corresponding author), Jamia Hamdard, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Sch Engn Sci & Technol, New Delhi, India.",shruti.kalsi88@gmail.com; harleen.unu@gmail.com; Victor.Chang@xjtlu.edu.cn,"Chang, Victor/AAC-7582-2019; K, Harleen/T-2613-2019","Chang, Victor/0000-0002-8012-5852; Kaur, Dr. Harleen/0000-0001-9780-2138","National Council for Science and Technology Communications (NCSTC), Department of Science and Technology (DST), Ministry of Science and Technology (Govt. of India); Ministry of Science and Technology (Govt. of India), India","This research work is catalyzed and supported by National Council for Science and Technology Communications (NCSTC), Department of Science and Technology (DST), Ministry of Science and Technology (Govt. of India) for support and motivation [grant recipient: Dr. Harleen Kaur].

In these areas, common ailments that are easy to manage with medicines, often lead to medical escalations and even fatalities due to lack of awareness and delayed diagnosis. The introduction of wearable health devices has made it easier to monitor health conditions and to connect doctors and patients in urban areas. However, existing initiatives have not succeeded in providing adequate health monitoring to rural and low-literate patients, as current methods are expensive, require consistent connectivity and expect literate users. Our design considerations address these concerns by providing low-cost medical devices connected to a low-cost health platform, along with personalized guidance based on patient physiological parameters in local languages, and alerts to medical practitioners in case of emergencies. This patient-centric integrated healthcare system is designed to manage the overall health of villagers with real-time health monitoring of patients, to offer guidance on preventive care, and to increase health awareness and self-monitoring at an affordable price. This personalized health monitoring system addresses the health-related needs in remote and rural areas by (1) empowering health workers in monitoring of basic health conditions for rural patients in order to prevent escalations, (2) personalized feedback regarding nutrition, exercise, diet, preventive Ayurveda care and yoga postures based on vital parameters and (3) reporting of patient data to the patient's health center with emergency alerts to doctor and patient. The system supports community health workers in the diagnostic procedure, management, and reporting of rural patients, and functions well even with only intermittent access to Internet.","[Nedungadi, Prema; Jayakumar, Akshay] Amrita Univ, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Ctr Res Analyt & Technol Educ CREATE, Amritapuri, Kerala, India; [Raman, Raghu] Amrita Univ, Sch Business, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India","Nedungadi, P (corresponding author), Amrita Univ, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Ctr Res Analyt & Technol Educ CREATE, Amritapuri, Kerala, India.;Raman, R (corresponding author), Amrita Univ, Sch Business, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.",prema@amrita.edu; raghu@amrita.edu,"Raman, Raghu/AAL-9550-2020","Raman, Raghu/0000-0002-0851-9742; Nedungadi, Prema/0000-0001-8774-3541",,,"Aswathy S, 2012, INDIAN J MED RES, V136, P20; Babu S, 2013, INT CONF RECENT, P702, DOI 10.1109/ICRTIT.2013.684428; Benharref A, 2014, IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH, V18, P46, DOI 10.1109/JBHI.2013.226265; Bui N., 2011, ISABEL 1; Darrel A, 2014, BIG DATA ANAL BIOINF, P40; Dilraj N., 2015, MOBIHEALTH 201; Fang Hu, 2013, 2013 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom), P2053, DOI 10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.38; Fong EM, 2013, SENSORS-BASEL, V13, P16451, DOI 10.3390/s13121645; Hii PC, 2011, SENSOR LETT, V9, P791, DOI 10.1166/sl.2011.161; James P.T., 2017, INDIAN J TUBER; Janakiram C, 2017, ECON POLIT WEEKLY, V52, P8; Jersak L.

However they pose new ethics and regulatory challenges since they cross the gap between patients and medical practitioners. One of the critical issues for CSP is to enforce a strict control on access privileges whilst allowing the users to take advantage of the breadth of the available data. We propose Cerberus, a new access control scheme spanning the whole life-cycle of access right management: design, implementation, deployment and maintenance, operations. Cerberus enables switching from a dual world, where CSP data can be accessed either from the users who entered it or fully de-identified, to an access-when-required world, where patients, practitioners and researchers can access focused medical data through explicit authorisation by the data owner. Efficient access control requires application-specific access rights, as well as the ability to restrict these rights when they are not used. Cerberus is implemented and evaluated in the context of the GENIDA project, an international CSP for Genetically determined Intellectual Disabilities and Autism Spectrum Disorders. As a result of this study, the software is made available for the community, and validated specifications for CSPs are given.","[Parrend, Pierre] ECAM Strasbourg Europe, 2 Rue Madrid, F-67300 Schiltigheim, France; [Parrend, Pierre; Collet, Pierre] Univ Strasbourg, ICube Lab, CNRS, Complex Syst Digital Campus UNESCO Unitwin, Strasbourg, France; [Mazzucotelli, Timothee; Colin, Florent; Mandel, Jean-Louis] CNRS, UMR 7104, IGBMC, Inserm U 964, 1 Rue Laurent Fries,BP 10142, F-67404 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Mandel, Jean-Louis] Coll France, Chaire Genet Humaine, Illkirch Graffenstaden, France","Parrend, P (corresponding author), ECAM Strasbourg Europe, 2 Rue Madrid, F-67300 Schiltigheim, France.;Parrend, P (corresponding author), Univ Strasbourg, ICube Lab, CNRS, Complex Syst Digital Campus UNESCO Unitwin, Strasbourg, France.",pierre.parrend@unistra.fr,"Parrend, Pierre/AAJ-8659-2021","Parrend, Pierre/0000-0002-1680-1182; COLIN, Florent/0000-0002-0527-2879",IDEX Excellence Initiative of the University of Strasbourg; Institute of Advanced Studies of the University of Strasbourg (USIAS); Foundation of the University of Strasbourg (Roche fund for personalised medicine); French National Programme for Rare Disease Cohorts (RaDiCo),"This research is funded by the IDEX Excellence Initiative of the University of Strasbourg, the Institute of Advanced Studies of the University of Strasbourg (USIAS), and by the Foundation of the University of Strasbourg (Roche fund for personalised medicine).

Thus in current IT era, our healthcare industry needs to focus on adapting information technology in healthcare services. Barring few preliminary attempts to digitalize basic hospital administrative and clinical functions, even today in India, child health and vaccination records are still maintained as paper-based records. Also, error in manually plotting the parameters in growth charts results in missed opportunities for early detection of growth disorders in children. To address these concerns, we present India's first hospital linked, affordable automated vaccination and real-time child's growth monitoring cloud based application-Integrated Child Health Record cloud (iCHRcloud). This application is based on HL7 protocol enabling integration with hospital's HIS/EMR system. It provides Java (Enterprise Service Bus and Hibernate) based web portal for doctors and mobile application for parents, enhancing doctor-parent engagement. It leverages highchart to automate chart preparation and provides access of data via Push Notification (GCM and APNS) to parents on iOS and Android mobile platforms. iCHRcloud has also been recognized as one of the best innovative solution in three nationwide challenges, 2016 in India. iCHRcloud offers a seamless, secure (256 bit HTTPS) and sustainable solution to reduce child mortality. Detail analysis on preliminary data of 16,490 child health records highlight the diversified need of various demographic regions. Thus, primary lesson would be to implement better validation strategies to fulfill the customize requisites of entire population. This paper presents first glimpse of data and power of the analytics in policy framework.","[Singh, Harpreet; Brahmachari, Samir K.] Acad Sci & Innovat Res, New Delhi, India; [Singh, Harpreet] iNICU Med Private Ltd, New Delhi, India; [Mallaiah, Raghuram] Fortis Le Femme, Greater Kailash 2, New Delhi, India; [Yadav, Gautam] Kalawati Hosp, Rewari, Haryana, India; [Verma, Nitin] Nitin Verma Clin, Delhi, India; [Sawhney, Ashu] Jaypee Hosp, Noida, UP, India; [Brahmachari, Samir K.] CSIR, Inst Genom & Integrated Biol, Mathura Rd, New Delhi 110020, India","Singh, H; Brahmachari, SK (corresponding author), Acad Sci & Innovat Res, New Delhi, India.;Singh, H (corresponding author), iNICU Med Private Ltd, New Delhi, India.;Brahmachari, SK (corresponding author), CSIR, Inst Genom & Integrated Biol, Mathura Rd, New Delhi 110020, India.",harpreet_singh@oxyent.com; skb@igib.in,,,"Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India [GAP0093]","We would like to thank DST, IBM, T-Hub and IIMA for recognizing the iCHRcloud as an innovative sustainable solution in child healthcare.

In the earlier stage of pregnancy, fetus problem can be identified by finding information about the fetus to avoid stillbirths. The gold standard used to monitor the health status of the fetus is by Cardiotachography(CTG), cannot be used for long durations and continuous monitoring. There is a need for continuous and long duration monitoring of fetal ECG signals to study the progressive health status of the fetus using portable devices. The non-invasive method of electrocardiogram recording is one of the best method used to diagnose fetal cardiac problem rather than the invasive methods. The monitoring of the fECG requires development of a miniaturized hardware and a efficient signal processing algorithms to extract the fECG embedded in the mother ECG. The paper discusses a prototype hardware developed to monitor and record the raw mother ECG signal containing the fECG and a signal processing algorithm to extract the fetal Electro Cardiogram signal. We have proposed two methods of signal processing, first is based on the Least Mean Square (LMS) Adaptive Noise Cancellation technique and the other method is based on the Wavelet Transformation technique. A prototype hardware was designed and developed to acquire the raw ECG signal containing the mother and fetal ECG and the signal processing techniques were used to eliminate the noises and extract the fetal ECG and the fetal Heart Rate Variability was studied. Both the methods were evaluated with the signal acquired from a fetal ECG simulator, from the Physionet database and that acquired from the subject. Both the methods are evaluated by finding heart rate and its variability, amplitude spectrum and mean value of extracted fetal ECG. Also the accuracy, sensitivity and positive predictive value are also determined for fetal QRS detection technique. In this paper adaptive filtering technique uses Sign-sign LMS algorithm and wavelet techniques with Daubechies wavelet, employed along with de noising techniques for the extraction of fetal Electrocardiogram. Both the methods are having good sensitivity and accuracy. In adaptive method the sensitivity is 96.83, accuracy 89.87, wavelet sensitivity is 95.97 and accuracy is 88.5. Additionally, time domain parameters from the plot of heart rate variability of mother and fetus are analyzed.","[Sutha, P.] PSNA Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Dindigul, Tamil Nadu, India; [Jayanthi, V.

In this research, in order to find the relevance of behavioral activity and its associated biosignal, biosignal changes before and after as well as during computer games were measured and analyzed for 31 subjects. For this purpose, a device to measure electrocardiogram, photoplethysmogram and skin temperature was developed such that the effect of motion artifacts could be minimized. The device was made wearable for convenient measurement. The game selected for the experiments was League of Legends T. Analysis on the pulse transit time, heart rate variability and skin temperature showed increased sympathetic nerve activities during computer game, while the parasympathetic nerves became less active. Interestingly, the sympathetic predominance group showed less change in the heart rate variability as compared to the normal group. The results can be valuable for studying internet gaming disorder.","[Yeo, Mina; Lim, Seokbeen] Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Yoon, Gilwon] Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect & IT Media Engn, 232 Gongneung Ro, Seoul 01811, South Korea","Yoon, G (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect & IT Media Engn, 232 Gongneung Ro, Seoul 01811, South Korea.",yma@seoultech.ac.kr; dandansurcle@seoultech.ac.kr; gyoon@seoultech.ac.kr,,"Lim, Seokbeen/0000-0002-4142-3478","Korea Health Technology R&D Project, Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea [A120157]","This research was supported by a grant of the Korea Health Technology R&D Project, Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea (grant number: A120157).","Allen J, 2007, PHYSIOL MEAS, V28, pR1, DOI 10.1088/0967-3334/28/3/R0; Benedict FG, 1919, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V5, P218, DOI 10.1073/pnas.5.6.21; Camm AJ, 1996, EUR HEART J, V17, P35; Campos LA, 2013, FRONT PHYSIOL, V4, DOI 10.3389/fphys.2013.0027; Carnagey NL, 2007, J EXP SOC PSYCHOL, V43, P489, DOI 10.1016/j.jesp.2006.05.00; Chaput JP, 2011, AM J CLIN NUTR, V93, P1196, DOI 10.3945/ajcn.110.00868; Dishman RK, 2000, INT J PSYCHOPHYSIOL, V37, P121, DOI 10.1016/S0167-8760(00)00085-; Freeman JV, 2006, PROG CARDIOVASC DIS, V48, P342, DOI 10.1016/j.pcad.2005.11.00; Gesche H, 2012, EUR J APPL PHYSIOL, V112, P309, DOI 10.1007/s00421-011-1983-; Hey S., 2009, EHEALTH TEL SOC MED, DOI DOI 10.1109/ETELEMED.2009.3; Ivarsson M, 2009, ACTA PAEDIATR, V98, P166, DOI 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.01096.; Jones S.
