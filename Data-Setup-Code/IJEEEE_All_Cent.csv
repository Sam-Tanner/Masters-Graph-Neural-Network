From the perspective of students' cognition, understanding the law of the occurrence and development of students' cognition is conducive to change the traditional rigid management mode to the development of flexible management mode. In addition, it also meets the requirements of student management to take into account students' cognitive and human needs, and provides guidance for student management in the new era, and enriches the theoretical basis of student management. Based on the educational cognitive theory, this paper conducts a questionnaire survey on College Students' management, and uses SPSS software to analyze the survey data, so as to measure the satisfaction of various management work, and to study the influence of cognitive theory on the management mode of college students in the new period. In the process of design, the questionnaire focuses on students' self-cognition and social cognition, especially the cognition of the other in students' social cognition, that is, the cognition of student management work and the cognition of student management workers. The results of the questionnaire survey show that there is a difference between students' self-perception and the cognition of others, and students' cognitive characteristics determine how to manage students. Student management workers need to improve the role of advisors, mentors and helpful friends. The cognitive characteristics of students determine the changes in student management. The cognitive needs of students determine the content of student management; the cognitive level of students accounts for 34% of the effectiveness of student management.","[Li, ZhiChao] Jinlin Agr Univ, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Zhai, Yanrong] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Sch Management, Chengdu 610000, Peoples R China","Zhai, YR (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Sch Management, Chengdu 610000, Peoples R China.",lk19870207@163.com,,,,,"Abuzainab N, 2017, IEEE T WIREL COMMUN, V16, P7687, DOI 10.1109/TWC.2017.274307; Acosta Luis A, 2017, Form.

In college English classroom teaching mode, as a brand teaching form, College English multimedia network teaching environment has brought advantages to classroom teaching, but also brought about impacts on teaching concepts, teaching models, teaching methods and other aspects. There are some phenomena that are inconsistent with the reform model at the students, teachers and the environment. The balance of traditional English classroom teaching has been broken, which has affected the smooth progress of college business English classroom teaching mode reform. It is very important to analyze and resolve these imbalances and find ecological methods for optimizing university English education. In this context, the advent of multimedia-assisted education technology has provided better conditions for the implementation of Business English classroom education in universities.

This study used a special study on Korean children (PSKC) 2-4 waves. Use t-test, correlation and autoregressive cross-delay modeling to analyze the data. The main findings of this study are: First, over time, parental pressure and mother's social research report are consistent. Secondly, the pressure of motherhood and childcare has an obvious lagging effect on upbringing, and vice versa. Third, there is no significant difference between working mothers and non-working mothers in terms of the stability of working parents' pressure, social research report and social research report for children's pressure channels. However, parental pressure can only predict the social research report of working mothers. Fourth, there is no significant difference between the stability and interaction of these two structures in household income levels. In short, the results show that, over time, parental pressure is consistent with mother's social research report. The results also show that there is a significant cross-lag effect between the mothers' perceptions of mutual pressure analysis. In the process from parental pressure to social research report, I found the difference between working and non-working mothers. The advantage of this study is that the expected longitudinal design was adopted during infancy and the priority between the two structures can be considered. The results of this study can be used as a source of intervention plans to help parents withstand severe parenting pressure and lack of social research report.","[Wang, Yong] Sejong Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 05006, South Korea","Wang, Y (corresponding author), Sejong Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 05006, South Korea.",1036373640@qq.com,,", Yong Wang/0000-0002-2737-362X",,,"Do H-S, 2012, Knowledge channel; Hyun-Mi K., 2004, J CHILDRENS ASS, V25, P27; Jinho K., 2007, BUSINESS ADM RS, V36, P89; Ki-Won K., 2010, MOTHERS EMPLOYMENT ; Kihyun K., 1997, J KOREAN HOME EC ASS, V35, P14; Kim E-S., 2012, KOREAN HOME MANAGE A, V2012, P7; Kim J-h., 2009, WRITING THESIS STRUC, V28, P1; Kim Sook-Ryong, 2014, [The Korea Association of Child Care and Education, 한국영유아보육학], V88, P4; Levy-Shiff R, 1998, DEV PSYCHOL, V34, P1417, DOI 10.1037/0012-1649.34.6.141; Lin N., 2015, SOCIAL SUPPORT LIF; Mami-Jeong, 2008, PARENT ED RES, V5, P7; Mann MB, 1987, EARLY CHILD DEV CARE, V27, P451, DOI DOI 10.1080; Manuel JI, 2012, SOC SCI MED, V75, P2013, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.07.03; Misuk K., 2005, FAM ENV RES, V43, P2; Mulsow M, 2002, J MARRIAGE FAM, V64, P944, DOI 10.1111/j.1741-3737.2002.00944.; Taeheon K, 2005, HLTH WELFARE FORUM, V102, P1; Taylor RD, 2010, CULT DIVERS ETHN MIN, V16, P344, DOI 10.1037/a001867; THOITS PA, 1986, J CONSULT CLIN PSYCH, V54, P416, DOI 10.1037/0022-006X.54.4.41; Thomason E, 2014, INFANT BEHAV DEV, V37, P406, DOI 10.1016/j.infbeh.2014.05.00",19,0,0,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Graduates go to the society, what they learn is not what they use. There is a phenomenon that education and employment deviate from each other. Even if they have a job, they have to learn again, which requires a longer adaptation period. According to the skills and abilities that human resource management (HRM) students may enter into after graduation, a targeted modular teaching system is constructed. The modular teaching system can carry out customized learning in advance according to the students' work goals, and grasp the required employability in advance. At the same time, the reform of the system also enriches the teaching methods of teachers. Through the questionnaire and experimental test, this paper finds that: modular teaching breaks the traditional curriculum design method under the framework of the discipline theoretical system, aims to cultivate students' professional ability, improve their adaptability to the job, and further enhance their practical employability. Experimental results: the relationship between the quality characteristics and academic performance of HRM students was verified, and the relationship between them and the influence model of causality were clarified. The results of the two classes are similar in the pre-test; and from the back results, we can see that the scores of the experimental class after the use of modular teaching are significantly improved, while the comparison class is not significantly improved compared with before the experiment, which fully shows that the implementation of modular teaching can help students improve their comprehensive performance. The path coefficient of growth driven to academic performance is 0.428, the path coefficient of learning development to academic performance is 0.122, and interpersonal skills affect academic performance indirectly. It fully verifies the relationship between the quality characteristic model and academic performance, and shows that the quality characteristic model constructed is relatively perfect and can be used as a reference for students' evaluation.","[Li, Chunyang] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Educ, D-01187 Dresden, Saxony, Germany","Li, CY (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Educ, D-01187 Dresden, Saxony, Germany.",lichunyang5181@163.com,,,,,"Al-Bulushi AH., 2017, TPLS, V7, P9; Bian HX, 2016, INT J EMERG TECHNOL, V11, P21, DOI 10.3991/ijet.v11i11.624; Bystritskaya E.V., 2016, INT J ENV SCI ED, V11, P8; Chen S., 2016, J MANAGE ORGAN, V22, P; Daniels SR, 2017, HUM RESOUR MANAGE R, V27, P8, DOI 10.1016/j.hrmr.2016.09.00; Dominguez-Falcon C, 2016, INT J CONTEMP HOSP M, V28, P490, DOI 10.1108/IJCHM-08-2014-038; Gawlik R, 2016, ENTREPR BUS ECON REV, V4, P153, DOI 10.15678/EBER.2016.04041; Guinot J, 2016, J BUS ETHICS, V138, P349, DOI 10.1007/s10551-015-2603-; Hsiao HS, 2016, BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL, V47, P372, DOI 10.1111/bjet.1223; Nguyen TLH, 2016, HIGH EDUC, V71, P231, DOI 10.1007/s10734-015-9898-; Karabasevic D, 2018, SERB J MANAG, V13, P145, DOI 10.5937/sjm13-1258; Kerroumia M., 2020, IJBM, V15, P5; Koko MN., 2019, INT J INNOVAT RES GR, V7, P4; Li ZM, 2017, AGRO FOOD IND HI TEC, V28, P215; Lou MY, 2017, INT J EMERG TECHNOL, V12, P117, DOI 10.3991/ijet.v12.i09.749; Madera JM, 2017, INT J CONTEMP HOSP M, V29, P48, DOI 10.1108/IJCHM-02-2016-005; Marozeau J, 2016, J ACOUST SOC AM, V140, P319; Murty O, 2017, J FOREN MED TOXICOL, V33, P; Radant O, 2016, J INF TECHNOL RES, V9, P65, DOI 10.4018/JITR.201601010; Ray B, 2017, J ENG TECHNOL, V34, P1; Runhaar P, 2016, EDUC MANAG ADM LEAD, V44, P794, DOI 10.1177/174114321456477; Sewagegn AA, 2021, TEACH HIGH EDUC, V26, P776, DOI 10.1080/13562517.2019.168139; Wang R, 2016, VISUAL COMPUT, V32, P1379, DOI 10.1007/s00371-015-1206-; Wang Y., 2017, INT J ADV PERVAS UBI, V4, P1; Wang Y, 2020, INT J EMERG TECHNOL, V15, P126, DOI 10.3991/ijet.v15i10.1412",25,0,0,2,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

On the basis of existing scholars' research, this paper expounds the three characteristics of output oriented education concept: learning as the center; emphasizing the integration of learning and application; paying attention to the whole person education. And through the research on the main problems existing in the current moral education curriculum teaching, it is found that the teaching methods are backward, the curriculum is few, and the teaching materials are unrealistic. This has led to the unsatisfactory effect of the moral education curriculum. This paper analyzes the causes of these problems, and uses the method of questionnaire survey to investigate the current situation of moral education teaching in a university in our city. The survey results show that most teachers and students think that moral education course is of great significance, but they are not interested in it. In view of the problems reflected in the survey results, this paper finally puts forward the following suggestions for reference: integrating teaching content, innovating teaching forms; strengthening the construction of teaching staff; effectively connecting the curriculum system and learning outcomes.","[Liu, Guoyong] Xian Fanyi Univ, Coll Marxism, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guanqun] Hebei Polytech Inst, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei, Peoples R China","Zhang, GQ (corresponding author), Hebei Polytech Inst, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei, Peoples R China.",zhangguanqun1201@126.com,,,Research and Practice of Education Statistics Platform Construction Based on Teaching Quality Assurance Construction System (Information Assurance Scientific Research Project of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education in 2020) [20JX002]; Research on Building Branding on Connotation Development by Xi'an Fanyi University [2020Z01],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Research and Practice of Education Statistics Platform Construction Based on Teaching Quality Assurance Construction System (Information Assurance Scientific Research Project of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education in 2020), item no. 20JX002 and Research on Building Branding on Connotation Development by Xi'an Fanyi University, item no. 2020Z01.","Baker EL, 2016, REV RES EDUC, V40, P94, DOI 10.3102/0091732X1667980; Bowers, 2017, NEW DIR ADU CONTIN E, V2017, P53, DOI [10.5604/01.3001.0013.9611, DOI 10.5604/01.3001.0013.9611; Bulent T., 2015, EURASIA J MATH SCI T, V11, P86; Chen XZ., 2015, NEPHRON CLIN PRACT, V3, P1; Chinnery A, 2015, EDUC THEORY, V65, P169, DOI 10.1111/edth.1210; Copp D, 2016, THEORY RES EDUC, V14, P149, DOI 10.1177/147787851665656; Dolan T, 2015, TEACH COLL REC, V117, P15; Jacoby JW, 2017, INT J CHILD CARE EDU, V11, DOI 10.1186/s40723-017-0034-; Johannessen D, 2017, KYBERNETES, V46, P223, DOI 10.1108/K-04-2016-008; Kim S., 2020, KJHE HIST KOREAN ED, V42, P; Kubal MR, 2016, LAT AM, V60, P217, DOI 10.1111/tla.1207; Liu G, 2020, COGN SYST RES, V60, P97, DOI 10.1016/j.cogsys.2019.09.00; Luca RD., 2016, ACTUAL INVEST ED, V13, P18; Majhanovich S., 2015, ED SCI THEORY PRACT, V37, P; Salinas D., 2017, WORLD J ED, V7, P; White LA, 2016, CAN PUBLIC ADMIN, V59, P26, DOI 10.1111/capa.1215; Wu W., 2020, J CLEAN PRO; Zhang L., 2015, OPEN J SOCIAL SCI, V3, P207, DOI [10.4236/jss.2015.312024, DOI 10.4236/JSS.2015.312024; Zhang L., 2015, CREATIVE ED, V06, P2427, DOI [10.4236/ce.2015.622249, DOI 10.4236/CE.2015.622249; Zhang YL., 2015, CREATIVE ED, V06, P41; Zhongyue W., 2015, PENETRATING MORAL ED, P20",21,0,0,8,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

A SPD course requires teamwork of students. It is therefore an important issue about how to group students in a more reasonable form to increase students' interest in the course and improve their performance. However, at present, it remains a challenge to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of group teaching and optimize group teaching through state-of-the-art methods such as artificial intelligence. In this study, we propose a qualitative analysis method to study the group teaching of students through teacher's subjective evaluation of different aspects of students' abilities. In particular, the proposed method is a background-based grouping method which takes into account the students' scores attained in prerequisite courses of a SPD course and realized by a genetic algorithm. Results of our experiment demonstrate that, compared with the conventional random grouping method, the proposed method improves the students' average scores in all eight SPD topics by 2.5 in the grade 2016 and 1.875 in grade 2017, respectively (the total score is 100). Therefore, our findings strongly support that grouping students based on their strengths (for example, the courses they are good at) can enhance students' interest in the SPD course and thereby improve students' SPD performance.","[Liu, Jun; Peng, Yuanxiu; Yang, Yihua] Nanchang Hangkong Univ, Dept Automat, Coll Informat Engn, Nanchang 330063, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","Liu, J (corresponding author), Nanchang Hangkong Univ, Dept Automat, Coll Informat Engn, Nanchang 330063, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",tosskid@126.com,,, [JXJG18-8-18],This research was supported by the 2018 teaching reform project of Jiangxi Province (JXJG18-8-18).,"Almarghani EM, 2017, TEACH HIGH EDUC, V22, P940, DOI 10.1080/13562517.2017.131980; Armaghani DJ, 2018, NEURAL COMPUT APPL, V29, P619, DOI 10.1007/s00521-016-2598-; Bharathi C, 2017, WIRELESS PERS COMMUN, V93, P481, DOI 10.1007/s11277-017-3959-; Britton E, 2017, ASSESS EVAL HIGH EDU, V42, P378, DOI 10.1080/02602938.2015.111649; Elhoseny M, 2017, IEEE SENSOR LETT, V1, DOI 10.1109/LSENS.2017.272484; Grapin SL, 2019, TRAIN EDUC PROF PSYC, V13, P307, DOI 10.1037/tep000022; Grimes L., 2017, CAREER PLANN ADULT D, V33, P2; Hart D., 2018, MAINE POLICY REV, V27, P3; Hiassat A, 2017, J MANUF SYST, V42, P93, DOI 10.1016/j.jmsy.2016.10.00; Hutto PN, 2017, COMMUNITY COLL J RES, V41, P4, DOI 10.1080/10668926.2015.106922; Li J., 2016, J YUNNAN NORMAL U NA, V36, P7; Metawa N, 2017, EXPERT SYST APPL, V80, P75, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2017.03.02; O'Neill TA, 2018, ASSESS EVAL HIGH EDU, V43, P571, DOI 10.1080/02602938.2017.138016; Pepin B, 2017, EDUC STUD MATH, V94, P257, DOI 10.1007/s10649-016-9727-; Pociask S, 2017, J SCHOLARSHIP TEACHI, V17, P19, DOI [10.14434/josotl.v17i3.21158, DOI 10.14434/JOSOTL.V17I3.21158; Shapiro VB, 2017, J SOC WORK EDUC, V53, P520, DOI 10.1080/10437797.2016.127589; Tarasi, 2017, MARKETING ED REV, V27, P187, DOI [10.1080/10528008.2017.1323555, DOI 10.1080/10528008.2017.1323555; Wright M, 2017, J TECHNOL TRANSFER, V42, P909, DOI 10.1007/s10961-017-9558-; Wu J., 2018, CE, V9, P259; Zhang C., 2020, EXP TECHNOL MANAG, V3",20,0,0,1,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

It has hitherto been part of the curriculum, right from kindergarten, to the higher institutions of learning like colleges and universities. It is thus imperative to form a concrete system that will ensure its smooth operation. The School sports management system is efficient with this respect. The School Sports management system (SSMS) is a set of protocols, procedures, and techniques used in educational institutions to ensure that all the activities run conclusively and smoothly. In sports and sporting activities, numerous reforms are always put in place and implemented to establish and improve the operational processes. An existing SSMS should accommodate these reforms and incorporate them into school sports and physical education curricula, which is the objective of this paper. This paper aims at discussing how the SSMS can adapt to sports reforms and If the school wants to reform the function of physical education, it needs to innovate the sports management system. At present, there are many drawbacks in school physical education. The following problems hinder the development of school physical education to a great extent. First, the related funds of school physical education subjects are obviously insufficient, the related expenses of physical education subjects account for a small proportion of the total funds of the school. Compared with the growth of the total funds of the school, the proportion is small, the equipment is not updated in a timely manner, and the development of physical education subjects mainly depends on the school allocation, which makes it difficult to form a benign fundraising mechanism. Second, the allocation of resources in the use of school physical education funds is not reasonable, and the allocation among teaching, scientific research and training expenses of sports teams is not appropriate. Third, the physical education departments of colleges and universities lack rational and scientific management, and lack of vitality within the departments, which to a large extent hinders the effective play of physical education functions. Therefore, in view of the above problems, this paper puts forward several principles that should be followed in the development of sports management system in the future.accustom to the changes. We discuss the importance of a management system in school sports explicitly, expounding on its operation. We then provide a listing of the reforms sports have encountered in recent times and how they can be integrated into the school curriculum.","[Zhang, Jiaxin; Fang, Wei] Yongin Univ, Sch Dept Phys Educ, Yongin, South Korea","Fang, W (corresponding author), Yongin Univ, Sch Dept Phys Educ, Yongin, South Korea.",fangwei931124@163.com,,,,,"Akehurst E, 2020, CURRIC STUD HEALTH P, V11, P83, DOI 10.1080/25742981.2019.163550; Black N, 2019, SOC SCI MED, V220, P120, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.10.02; Chen PJ, 2020, J SPORT HEALTH SCI, V9, P322, DOI [10.1016/j.jshs.2020.04.003, 10.1080/09546634.2019.1708853; de Resende MC., 2019, PENSAR PRATICA, V2; Devine JW, 2019, SPORT ETHICS PHILOS, V13, P161, DOI 10.1080/17511321.2017.140462; Guzman-Ramirez E, 2015, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V52, P22, DOI 10.1177/002072091557123; Kandasamy I, 2020, SOFT COMPUT, V24, P7459, DOI 10.1007/s00500-019-04372-; Lindsey I, 2020, SPORT EDUC SOC, V25, P27, DOI 10.1080/13573322.2018.154727; Liu L., 2019, 2 INT S SOC SCI MA; Luna P, 2019, INT J ENV RES PUB HE, V16, DOI 10.3390/ijerph1610182; Mirzaev FR, 2019, THEOR APPL SCI, V73, P43; Riba JR, 2017, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V54, P35, DOI 10.1177/002072091665950; Wilson AL, 2019, INT J BEHAV NUTR PHY, V16, DOI 10.1186/s12966-019-0847-",13,0,0,5,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In this paper, we analyze the effect of China's official export credit insurance on Chinese exports to countries in the world. We describes the background of official export insurance in general and the development of China's ECI. Meanwhile, we discuss the data and model used to examine the relationship between China's ECIs and exports. We estimate both the static and dynamic gravity models where exports are a function of country size, transportation costs, and country-risk. Our results of static model suggest that that a 1 percent increase in China's official ECI coverage stimulates its exports volume by 0.34 percent. Furthermore, Chinese companies export 1.5 times more to countries with ECIs than to those countries where ECIs are not available. Our estimates from the dynamic model are similar to the static model, to a lesser extent, of ECI impacts on exports to trading partners.","[Fang, Fengxia] Meizhouwan Vocat Technol Coll, Dept Business Adm, Putian 351119, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Chou, Nan-Ting] Univ Louisville, Dept Econ, Louisville, KY USA","Fang, FX (corresponding author), Meizhouwan Vocat Technol Coll, Dept Business Adm, Putian 351119, Fujian, Peoples R China.",ffx2036@outlook.com,,,,,"Abraham F, 2000, OPEN ECON REV, V11, P5, DOI 10.1023/A:100838851197; Anderson JE, 2003, AM ECON REV, V93, P170, DOI 10.1257/00028280332145521; ANDERSON JE, 1979, AM ECON REV, V69, P10; Auboin M, 2014, REV WORLD ECON, V150, P715, DOI 10.1007/s10290-014-0195-; Badinger H, 2013, WORLD ECON, V36, P1115, DOI 10.1111/twec.1208; Baltensperger E, 2009, OPEN ECON REV, V20, P545, DOI 10.1007/s11079-007-9076-; BERGSTRAND JH, 1989, REV ECON STAT, V71, P143, DOI 10.2307/192806; Desai MA, 2008, J INT ECON, V74, P459, DOI 10.1016/j.jinteco.2007.04.00; Egger P, 2006, WORLD ECON, V29, P399, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9701.2006.00790.; Felbermayr GJ, 2013, WORLD ECON, V36, P967, DOI 10.1111/twec.1203; FUNATSU H, 1986, J RISK INSUR, V53, P679, DOI 10.2307/25297; Goksel T, 2010, SOSYOEKONOMI, V2010, P10; Janda K, 2013, WORLD ECON, V36, P1588, DOI 10.1111/twec.1206; Li CF, 2013, CHINESE GEOGR SCI, V23, P470, DOI 10.1007/s11769-013-0611-; Moser C, 2008, WORLD ECON, V31, P781, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9701.2008.01102.; Mullingan R, 2007, J Manag Res, V7, P4; Xiao W, 1978, BRIT J CANCER, V37, P15",17,0,0,5,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The main purpose is to use the course of mechanical drawing to accurately represent the appearance, size, principle and technology of the machine. It is often called the language of communication in the industry. In order to make mechanical drawing better applied and practiced, and to make maximum use of Internet technical resources, the establishment of multimedia courseware teaching mechanism is the development trend of mechanical drawing.In order to adapt to the trend of network information, based on the multimedia environment, this paper studies the application of animation technology in mechanical drawing teaching, and constructs a small multimedia teaching platform. Through the explanation of animation courseware, students can better understand the making and principle of mechanical drawing, and cultivate students' divergent thinking. The teaching platform combines teaching material knowledge with practice to deepen students' understanding of the basic content of mechanical drawing. Finally, the rationality and practicability of the system are analyzed by investigating the platform users. The results show that the application of animation technology in mechanical drawing teaching is reasonable and practical.","[Shen, Yucheng] Huaiyin Normal Univ, Sch Educ Sci, Huaian, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lu, Wei] Guilin Univ Elect Technol, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Guilin, Peoples R China","Lu, W (corresponding author), Guilin Univ Elect Technol, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Guilin, Peoples R China.",lujunqi2001@163.com,"shen, YC/ACO-1451-2022","shen, YC/0000-0001-8801-8413", [C99YXM00YX00],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the project of teaching research (C99YXM00YX00).","Anckar B., 2001, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, V13, P241, DOI 10.1108/0959611011039593; [Anonymous], 1941, BELL SYST TECH J, V20, P95, DOI 10.1002/j.1538-7305.1941.tb00854.; Betrancourt M, 2000, TRAV HUMAIN, V63, P31; Bhatt AK, 2014, AI SOC, V29, P103, DOI 10.1007/s00146-012-0425-; Del Frate F, 1998, RADIO SCI, V33, P40; DETITTA GT, 1975, ACTA CRYSTALLOGR A, V31, P472, DOI 10.1107/S056773947500103; Farrell SP, 2004, ARCH PSYCHIAT NURS, V18, P121, DOI 10.1016/j.apnu.2004.05.00; Filutowicz Zbigniew, 2016, Journal of Applied Computer Science Methods, V8, P29, DOI 10.1515/jacsm-2016-000; Graburn N, 2017, SOC ANTHROPOL, V25, P83, DOI 10.1111/1469-8676.1239; Hideki S., 2014, J MATER PROCESS TECH, V55, P4; Huang C, 2003, COMPUT MED IMAG GRAP, V27, P157, DOI 10.1016/S0895-6111(02)00089-; Jou M, 2016, COMPUT EDUC, V92-93, P181, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2015.10.00; Kanai T, 2018, J LIGHTWAVE TECHNOL, V36, P1516, DOI 10.1109/JLT.2017.278799; Ko HK., 2017, J NEUROPHYSIOL, V3, P1; Lin J, 2009, INT J MACH TOOL MANU, V49, P73, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2008.07.01; Mishra A, 2018, MATH BIOSCI ENG, V15, P441, DOI 10.3934/mbe.201802; Newby T, 2000, EDUC TECHNOL SOC, V3, P10; RIJPKEMA H, 1991, COMP GRAPH, V25, P33; SCHENNING JG, 1978, J HIGH RES CHROMATOG, V1, P10; Xingjun Chu, 1999, Integrated Manufacturing Systems, V10, P8; [徐杨 Xu Yang], 2015, [金属热处理, Heat Treatment of Metals], V40, P7; Yang LU., 2012, COMPUT MODERN, V208, P9; [张勤俭 Zhang Qinjian], 2014, [应用基础与工程科学学报, Journal of Basic Science and Engineering], V22, P38; Zhang Y., 2019, IEEE ELECT DEVICE LE, V40, P",24,2,2,13,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This study aims to examine if childhood trauma and internet addiction does predict depression on LBA in comparison to Non-Left Behind Adolescents (NLBA) in China. Methods Participants in the study includes a sample of 1890 adolescents aged 12 to 27, including 102 LBA and 1399 NLBA in China. All participants completed the self-report questionnaires, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-28), Internet Addiction Test (IAT), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results There was a significant difference in IAT and CTQ between LBA and NLBA (P < 0.05). The frequent childhood trauma type was physical neglect (48%), followed by emotional neglect (32.3%). Males reported higher levels of emotional and physical abuse and physical neglect than female counterparts in LBA. The prevalence of depression (23.5%) and internet addiction (29.4%) were higher among LBA than NLBA. There were no significant differences in depression (p > 0.05). There were positive correlations between CTQ (except emotional neglect), BDI, and IAT. Multiple linear regressions indicated that emotional abuse and neglect, internet addiction, and poor academic performance were significant predictors for depression among LBA. Conclusion Childhood trauma and internet addiction were directly related to symptoms of depression in LBA, There is an urgent need for targeted interventions for LBA to prevent negative mental health outcomes.","[Dong, Xue; Du, JiaYu; Hu, Yahua; Wang, ZhengHong] Shaanxi Univ Sci & Technol, Youth Mental Hlth Educ & Counseling Ctr, Dept Psychol, Xian 710021, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Su, Fang] Shaanxi Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ & Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Dong, X (corresponding author), Shaanxi Univ Sci & Technol, Youth Mental Hlth Educ & Counseling Ctr, Dept Psychol, Xian 710021, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",dongxue@sust.edu.cn,,,Shaanxi Social Science Fund Project of China: Exploration of the Intervention Mechanism of Psychological trauma for Left-behind University Students in Shaanxi Province [2017P006]; student academic development studio of Shannxi Province,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the Shaanxi Social Science Fund Project of China: Exploration of the Intervention Mechanism of Psychological trauma for Left-behind University Students in Shaanxi Province (NO.2017P006).

The main objective of the Integrated circuits course is to raise the interest in microelectronics, convince the students that IC design is not a secret science requiring extraordinary talent and prepare the students for continuation toward M.Sc. degree. The course includes a mixture of teaching materials available online for self-studying, short video files, interactive self-tests, two hands on exercises and educational software needed for these exercises. E-mail and/or phone consultations, face-to-face or online meetings with the instructor are possible. About 1/3 of all students enrolled for the distance learning course perceive the Integrated circuits course as interesting, praise the design exercises and ask if it would be possible to continue education in microelectronic design at a more advanced level. Unfortunately distance learning at advanced level is not possible, mainly because professional design software can be used only on site, not remotely.","[Kuzmicz, Wieslaw] Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Elect & Informat Technol, Inst Microelect & Optoelect, Warsaw, Poland","Kuzmicz, W (corresponding author), Inst Microelect & Optoelect, Ul Nowowiejska 15-19, PL-00665 Warsaw, Poland.",wieslaw.kuunicz@pw.edu.pl,"Kuzmicz, Wieslaw/AIC-5320-2022","Kuzmicz, Wieslaw/0000-0001-5201-2503",EU Structural Funds; UDA-POKL [.04.01.01-00-002/08-00],"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Development of the teaching materials described in the paper was partially supported by the EU Structural Funds (project no.

In this research, EVIW method is optimized for the economic value estimation of agricultural water use from the perspective of crops. Crop Price per unit for crop production, crop yield per acre and irrigation area are used to calculate gross profit. Crop variable costs per acre (labor costs, chemical costs, machinery fuel and repair costs, etc.) and corresponding irrigation areas are used to calculate variable costs. Gross revenues and variable costs are used to calculate the net returns generated by irrigation water. Arizona agricultural water use for crops are estimated based on meteorological data and Cropland Data Layers. Finally, economic values of agricultural water are determined by the net returns of irrigated crops and agricultural water use. The results show that the economic values of agricultural water are positive and negative with great variations. The models applied in the research bring forward practical conclusions for further water allocations, transfer, and policies.","[Ma, Miaosen; Gao, Sheng; Lu, Yanyan; Yao, Yuan] Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Nat Resources & Environm Audits, Nanjing 211815, Peoples R China","Gao, S (corresponding author), Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Nat Resources & Environm Audits, Nanjing 211815, Peoples R China.",gaosheng921@126.com,,"Ma, Miaosen/0000-0003-0237-0315",Collaborative Innovation Center of Audit Information Engineering and Technology [18CICA10]; The Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China [19KJB170003],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The article is supported by Collaborative Innovation Center of Audit Information Engineering and Technology (18CICA10) and The Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China (19KJB170003).","Acquaye A, 2017, J ENVIRON MANAGE, V187, P571, DOI 10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.10.05; Annes B., 2015, VALUE WATER COLORADO, V58, P22; [Anonymous], 2016, ARIZONA AGR STAT B ; Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR), 2010, ASSURED ADEQUATE WAT, V1, P33; Boryan C, 2011, GEOCARTO INT, V26, P341, DOI 10.1080/10106049.2011.56230; Brown P., 2005, J WATER RESOUR PLANN, V32, P; Brown P., 1996, AZMET ARIZONA METEO; Brown P., 2015, CASE STUDY EFFICIENC, V23, P6; Center for Spatial Information Science and Systems U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2017, CROPSCAPE CROPLAND ; Chouchane H, 2015, ECOL INDIC, V52, P311, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.12.01; Darzi-Naftchali A, 2019, THEOR APPL CLIMATOL, V135, P1, DOI 10.1007/s00704-017-2355-; Draper AJ, 2003, J WATER RES PL-ASCE, V129, P155, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(2003)129:3(155; Fox F., 1993, AZSCHED SOFTWARE REA, V73, P19; Frederick KD., 1996, RESOURCES FUTURE, V16, P12; Graveline N, 2016, ENVIRON MODELL SOFTW, V81, P12, DOI 10.1016/j.envsoft.2016.03.00; Hogeboom RJ, 2017, WATER-SUI, V9, DOI 10.3390/w910080; Mankiw N.Gregory., 2015, ESSENTIALS EC, V7t; Martin EC., 2005, P 2005 INT IRRIGATIO, P; Merrett S, 2002, IRRIG DRAIN, V51, P265, DOI 10.1002/ird.5; Miglietta PP, 2018, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V633, P1280, DOI 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.03.27; Miglietta PP, 2018, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V10, DOI 10.3390/su1002054; Naeser RB, 1998, NAT RESOUR J, V38, P44; Owusu-Sekyere E, 2017, ECOL INDIC, V83, P32, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.07.04; Perotoni MB, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P193, DOI 10.1177/002072091879009; Schuster E., 2012, UNDERSTANDING VALU; Teegerstrom T., 2010, 2000 2001 ARIZONA V; Teegerstrom T., 2000, **DROPPED REF*; U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2010, FIELD CROPS USUAL PL, V1, P21; U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service , 2010, FIELD CROPS USUAL PL, V1, P62; U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service, 2011, PRICE INDEXES DISCO; US.

In recent years the carrier and reference modification based research is going on the inverter field. This paper suggests that the alteration of carriers and references of the three phase voltage source inverter enhance the ability to decrease the harmonic content.This enhanced realization deals with the carrier and reference modification arrangement for three phase voltage source inverter through amalgamating the boosted reference and random triangular carrier. The boosted reference is the addition of sine reference with injection of 1/3rd of reference amplitude (3fs) in the middle portion of the reference wave. i.e., Pi/3 to 2 Pi/3 and 4 Pi/3 to 5 Pi/3. The proposed PWM scheme use two carriers, one is Triangle wave and another one is inverted Triangle wave. The process of selecting the winning carrier among the two triangle carriers is purely based on the LFSR technique. The spectral quality of the induction motor drives has improved by the random carriers. The simulation and experimental values are proving the validity of the PWM method. The PWMs are generated by using parallel processing enabled FPGA processor.","[Anand, R.] Nehru Inst Engn & Technol, Dept EEE, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Padmasuresh, L.] Baselios Mathews II Coll Engn, Dept EEE, Sasthamkotta, Kerala, India; [Muthukumar, P.; Ramesh, M., V] Prasad V Potluri Siddhartha Inst Technol, Dept EEE, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Sreeja, P.] KMEA Engn Coll, Dept EEE, Aluva, Kerala, India; [Krishnakumar, V] St Josephs Coll Engn, Dept EEE, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","Muthukumar, P (corresponding author), Prasad V Potluri Siddhartha Inst Technol, Dept EEE, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India.",muthukumarvlsi@gmail.com,"Paramasivan, Muthu kumar/D-8874-2018; vengadakrishnan, krishnakumar/AAH-8465-2020","Paramasivan, Muthu kumar/0000-0002-4430-2145; vengadakrishnan, krishnakumar/0000-0001-6319-5237; L, PADMA SURESH/0000-0001-8939-1113",,,"Aleem SHEA, 2019, IEEE ACCESS, V7, P100824, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.293083; Arulmozhiyal R, 2010, J POWER ELECTRON, V10, P65, DOI 10.6113/JPE.2010.10.1.06; Guzman-Ramirez E, 2015, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V52, P22, DOI 10.1177/002072091557123; Harrison CG, 1997, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V34, P370, DOI 10.1177/00207209970340040; Jacob T., 2016, INT C EM TECHN TREND, P1, DOI [10.1109/ICETT.2016.7873768, DOI 10.1109/ICETT.2016.7873768; Jeyashanthi J, 2020, CONTROL ENG APPL INF, V22, P6; Kim KS, 2009, IEEE T POWER ELECTR, V24, P192, DOI 10.1109/TPEL.2008.200661; Krishnakumar V, 2015, AUST J BASIC APPL SC, V9, P16; Lim YC, 2010, IEEE T POWER ELECTR, V25, P797, DOI 10.1109/TPEL.2009.203569; Marikkannan A, 2019, CONTROL ENG APPL INF, V21, P5; Muthukumar P, 2020, J POWER ELECTRON, V20, P479, DOI 10.1007/s43236-020-00034-; Sathik MAJ, 2017, ELECTR POW COMPO SYS, V45, P1001, DOI 10.1080/15325008.2017.131943; Shankar M, 2019, CONTROL ENG APPL INF, V21, P3",13,0,0,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

For a long time, state-owned enterprises of China as the backbone of social responsibility, to shoulder a large number of policy burden. When corporates' social responsibility rises to the height of the national strategic development level and becomes the focus of government attention, what is the impact of state-owned enterprise social responsibility on financial performance? Will the impact of social responsibility on financial performance in our country be different between private enterprises and state-owned enterprises? This article attempts to study these issues. The study shows that the social responsibility of Chinese enterprises has reduced its financial performance significantly. The more concerned on different aspects of social responsibility, the lower the financial performance.

P.E. has long-established been the elementary role played by schools in promoting physical activity, which in turn has brought with its numerous benefits as far as health is concerned. Various study approaches have been put in place. These approaches assist in reviewing the status of physical education and physical activity in college institutions. The review process helps solely in examining both their short-term and long-term benefits and effects. Merely introducing physical education facet in colleges and forming review committees will not aid in implementing this curriculum, and appropriate teaching frameworks should be delineated. Proper frameworks set in place will ensure full utilization of physical education methods, which will, in turn, reap more benefits. This study aims to conduct exploratory research on the multiple ways of teaching physical education in higher institutions of learning, in particular, colleges. We will be running a double-blind qualitative case study framework to enumerate the effectiveness of the different strategies of P.E. teaching.

Methods The initial items of the questionnaire are formed by interview, open questionnaire and document retrieval. On the basis of forecast, 692 valid questionnaires are obtained from the subjects with the self-designed questionnaire. The life orientation questionnaire is used to test the validity of the criterion. Results The questionnaire on college students' optimism contains 13 items, including two high-order factors: optimism and pessimism. Optimism includes optimistic expectation and optimistic explanatory style which pessimism factor includes pessimistic expectation and pessimistic explanatory style. The fitting indicators are better (X2/df = 3.45, GFI = 0.96, IFI = 0.95, NNFI = 0.93, CFI = 0.95 and RMSEA = 0.06), internal consistency reliability is between 0.61 and 0.74, and all sub-dimensions of the questionnaire are significantly correlated. The total scores of the questionnaire and four factors are positively correlated with the total scores of the life orientation questionnaire (0.74 similar to 0.81). Conclusion The college students' optimism is composed of four factors; the reliability and validity meet the requirements of psychometrics, and can be used in related research and practice. This study seemed to show that the CSOQ was a valid tool for measuring optimism among Chinese college students.","[Li, Xiaojun; Ren, Qiping] Nanjing XiaoZhuang Univ, Inst Mental Hlth, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Yu, Zhihui] Shanghai Univ Polit Sci & Law, Inst Higher Educ, Shanghai 201701, Peoples R China","Yu, ZH (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ Polit Sci & Law, Inst Higher Educ, Shanghai 201701, Peoples R China.",bellayu2020@126.com,,,Hubei Provincial Education Department [16G117]; Nanjing XiaoZhuang University [2020NXY16]; Hanjiang Normal University [2019C15]; Youth Fund for Humanities and Social Sciences Research of the Ministry of Education [18YJC710092]; General Project of Philosophy and Social Science Planning in Shanghai [2017BKS011],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study is supported by the humanities and Social Sciences project of the Hubei Provincial Education Department (A Research of Teachers' Development in Perspective of social support base on Rural teachers support planNO.16G117).

The device is improved from the traditional thyristor-controlled series compensation (TCSC), which has the characteristics of small output harmonics and simple control. The traditional saturated iron-core reactor is improved to increase the adjustable range of output reactance. During the fault, the MCR is connected to the grid alone to limit fault current; when the grid is normal, MCR and capacitor are used in series compensation mode. It effectively improves the utilization rate of the traditional current limiter MCR.

The methods with the use of simulation programs and an innovative approach enabling work on real equipment are presented. The solutions presented in the article were practically and successfully implemented in connection with the coronavirus pandemic in spring 2020 at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of West Pomeranian University of Technology in Szczecin. A very important feature of the presented ideas is the possibility to adapt the already existing stationary solutions to remote work and use free applications. The characteristic feature of the presented ideas is also simplicity. These two features make it possible to implement remote learning quickly and at a low-cost. Classes conducted using the described system for a group of about 50 students were positively evaluated by them. Their opinions were also included in the article.,"[Raczynski, Michal] West Pomeranian Univ Technol, Fac Elect Engn, PL-70310 Szczecin, Poland","Raczynski, M (corresponding author), West Pomeranian Univ Technol, Fac Elect Engn, PL-70310 Szczecin, Poland.",michal.raczynski@zut.edu.pl,,"Raczynski, Michal/0000-0002-4106-6802",,,"Adami T.

The purpose is to find a new method that can be used in traditional handicraft design, and to explore the application of 3 D reconstruction technology in it. Based on the description and analysis of 3 D reconstruction technology, the 3 D reconstruction algorithm based on Poisson equation is analyzed, and the key steps and problems of the method are clarified. Then, by introducing the shielding design constraint, a 3 D reconstruction algorithm based on shielded Poisson equation is proposed. Finally, the performance of two algorithms is compared by reconstructing the 3 D image of rabbit. The results show that: when the depth value of the algorithm is 11, the surface of the rabbit image obtained by the proposed optimization algorithm is smoother, and the details are more delicate and fluent; under different depth values, with the increase of the depth value, the number of vertices and faces of the two algorithms increase, and the optimal depth values of 3 D reconstruction are more than 8. However, the proposed optimization algorithm has more vertices, and performs better in the reconstruction process; the larger the depth value is, the more time and memory are consumed in 3 D reconstruction, so it is necessary to select the appropriate depth value; the shielding parameters of the algorithm have a great impact on the fineness of the reconstruction model. The larger the parameter is, the higher the fineness is. In a word, the proposed 3 D reconstruction algorithm based on shielded Poisson equation has better practicability and superiority.","[Zhang, GuoLong] Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Sch Art & Design, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China","Zhang, GL (corresponding author), Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Sch Art & Design, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.",animo@mail.lzjtu.cn,,,National Social Science Foundation Art Project Research on the Inheritance and Innovation of Shadow Play from the Perspective of Virtual Interactive Technology [17BB033],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: National Social Science Foundation Art Project Research on the Inheritance and Innovation of Shadow Play from the Perspective of Virtual Interactive Technology (Grant No. 17BB033).","An WG, 2021, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072092098504; Angelopoulou A, 2015, NEUROCOMPUTING, V150, P16, DOI 10.1016/j.neucom.2014.03.07; Birk M, 2014, J REAL-TIME IMAGE PR, V9, P159, DOI 10.1007/s11554-012-0267-; Chen C, 2017, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V76, P4405, DOI 10.1007/s11042-015-3177-; Emam SM, 2014, PROC TECH, V12, P353, DOI 10.1016/j.protcy.2013.12.49; Fathi H, 2015, ADV ENG INFORM, V29, P149, DOI 10.1016/j.aei.2015.01.01; Jardini AL, 2014, J CRANIO MAXILL SURG, V42, P1877, DOI 10.1016/j.jcms.2014.07.00; Li WB, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072092094058; Loftfield N, 2018, MEAS SCI TECHNOL, V29, DOI 10.1088/1361-6501/aabe3; Ma TS, 2020, APPL INTELL, V50, P905, DOI 10.1007/s10489-019-01523-; Mullner T, 2014, MATER TODAY, V17, P404, DOI 10.1016/j.mattod.2014.07.00; Rottensteiner F, 2014, ISPRS J PHOTOGRAMM, V93, P256, DOI 10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2013.10.00; Wei Y, 2019, OCEAN ENG, V178, P463, DOI 10.1016/j.oceaneng.2019.03.01; Wong KC, 2015, COMPUT AIDED SURG, V20, P14, DOI 10.3109/10929088.2015.107603; Zhang J, 2019, IET COMPUT VIS, V13, P213, DOI 10.1049/iet-cvi.2018.515; Zhu XL, 2014, COMP MATER SCI, V85, P38, DOI 10.1016/j.commatsci.2013.12.05",16,0,0,2,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The multimodal literacy teaching in the college English multimodal teaching mode is to help students internalize their English language skills after learning and understanding English knowledge, thus improving the efficiency of English learning. The hot spots and topics in the information age are always inseparable from technological innovation. Wearable technology is becoming more and more popular, the scope of research is expanding, and innovations are constantly emerging, showing interdisciplinary and integrated features. This paper introduces the wearable technology in detail, and takes the college English teaching as an opportunity. Through the questionnaire survey of teachers and students, this paper analyzes the survey data. The results of the survey show that wearable technology can stimulate academic interest in college English. This research attempts to conduct interdisciplinary research on multi-modal semiotics and humanistic teaching methods in the following areas, which expands the scope of research and, to a certain extent, enhances the vitality of multi-modal discourse analysis.","[Dou, Qiang] Xian Fanyi Univ, Sch Educ, Xian 710105, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Dou, Q (corresponding author), Xian Fanyi Univ, Sch Educ, Xian 710105, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",john811221@126.com,,,,,"Aliverti A, 2017, BREATHE, V13, pE27, DOI 10.1183/20734735.00841; Antropova N, 2017, MED PHYS, V44, P5162, DOI 10.1002/mp.1245; Chartsias A, 2018, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V37, P803, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2017.276432; Chen JF, 2022, IEEE T SOFTWARE ENG, V48, P1529, DOI [10.1109/TSE.2020.3023955, 10.1109/TETC.2020.2974183; Chen YT, 2019, MATHEMATICS-BASEL, V7, DOI 10.3390/math701001; Crooks KR, 2017, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V114, P7635, DOI 10.1073/pnas.170576911; de Florian D, 2017, PHYS REV D, V95, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.95.09401; Ding ST, 2019, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V93, P583, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.10.05; Fenchel Daphna, 2017, Harefuah, V156, P77; Haghi M, 2017, HEALTHC INFORM RES, V23, P4, DOI 10.4258/hir.2017.23.1.; Herrlinger S, 2017, RES SCI EDUC, V47, P685, DOI 10.1007/s11165-016-9525-; Kolodzey L., 2017, BMJ INNOV, V3, P55, DOI DOI 10.1136/BMJINNOV-2016-00013; Li JH, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091989108; Liu L, 2017, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V26, P107, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2016.261926; Lv ZH, 2021, ACM T MULTIM COMPUT, V17, DOI 10.1145/339129; Lv ZH, 2021, ACM T INTERNET TECHN, V21, DOI 10.1145/338276; Lv ZH, 2020, APPL SOFT COMPUT, V92, DOI 10.1016/j.asoc.2020.10630; Lv ZH, 2020, IEEE T IND INFORM, V16, P2566, DOI 10.1109/TII.2019.291668; Meijer HA, 2018, ARCH PHYS MED REHAB, V99, P1890, DOI 10.1016/j.apmr.2017.10.01; Pevnick JM, 2018, TRENDS CARDIOVAS MED, V28, P144, DOI 10.1016/j.tcm.2017.08.00; Praveen S., 2017, INT J COMPUTATION IN, V13, P212; Ramya K, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P364, DOI 10.1177/002072091881380; Ranker J, 2018, SOC SEMIOT, V28, P169, DOI 10.1080/10350330.2017.127891; Ravi D, 2017, IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH, V21, P56, DOI 10.1109/JBHI.2016.263328; Royce TJ, 2019, CLIN GENITOURIN CANC, V17, P23, DOI 10.1016/j.clgc.2018.09.02; Seneviratne S, 2017, IEEE COMMUN SURV TUT, V19, P2573, DOI 10.1109/COMST.2017.273197; Srinivasa KG, 2018, J ORGAN END USER COM, V30, P83, DOI 10.4018/JOEUC.201810010; Stephenson A, 2017, INT J BEHAV NUTR PHY, V14, DOI 10.1186/s12966-017-0561-; Villermaux E, 2017, INT J FRACTURE, V206, P171, DOI 10.1007/s10704-017-0207-; Xu ZW, 2018, AM J HUM GENET, V103, P100, DOI 10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.06.00; Zhang N, 2015, IEEE COMMUN MAG, V53, P59, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2015.712004; Zhang YS, 2020, IEEE T INF FOREN SEC, V15, P1683, DOI 10.1109/TIFS.2019.294787",32,0,0,18,51,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In the context of multiculturalism, if we want to cultivate talents who can communicate across cultures, domestic English teaching needs further reforms. The unified implementation of English teaching in China has lasted for decades, and the research on teaching theory has gradually formed a stable framework. But from an overall point of view, instillation teaching under test-oriented education is not conducive to improving students' English practice level. In order to solve this problem, this article analyzes the cultural teaching content in college English teaching from a cross-cultural perspective, and emphasizes the importance of cultural infiltration in English teaching. At the same time, it analyzes the problems in teaching practice from multiple aspects of listening, speaking, reading, writing and translation, and puts forward suggestions for the construction of a cross-cultural communication ability training system. Experiments show that in the classes taught by ordinary English teachers, the average proportion of classroom culture teaching is only 14.995%; under the same conditions, the average proportion of classroom culture teaching in the classes taught by foreign teachers reaches 33.865%. Combined with the higher average scores of students in foreign teachers' classes, it can be known that cultural teaching can play a certain role in improving the level of comprehensive English teaching.","[Liu, Shuang] Jilin Sport Univ, Changchun 130000, Jilin, Peoples R China","Liu, S (corresponding author), Jilin Sport Univ, Changchun 130000, Jilin, Peoples R China.",41361899@qq.com,,,,,"Brass J, 2015, ENGL TEACH-PRACT CRI, V14, P241, DOI 10.1108/ETPC-06-2015-005; Breda A, 2017, EURASIA J MATH SCI T, V13, P1893, DOI 10.12973/eurasia.2017.01207; Charalambous CY, 2015, J MATH TEACH EDUC, V18, P427, DOI 10.1007/s10857-015-9318-; Della Piana B, 2018, EUR J INT MANAG, V12, P223, DOI 10.1504/EJIM.2018.1001126; Deng LF, 2016, CREATIVITY RES J, V28, P357, DOI 10.1080/10400419.2016.119561; Fant L, 2016, PRAGMAT SOC, V7, P540, DOI 10.1075/ps.7.4.02fa; Girunyan G., 2015, MULTIMOD COMMUN, V4, P15; He P., 2017, ENGL LANG TEACH, V11, P4; Jing M., 2015, J HUBEI CORRESP U, V36, P47; Kang X., 2015, BIORES TECHNOL, V191, P14; Kearney E, 2015, FOREIGN LANG ANN, V48, P100, DOI 10.1111/flan.1212; Kidd LI, 2015, ISSUES MENT HEALTH N, V36, P112, DOI 10.3109/01612840.2014.95327; Kneen J, 2015, ENGL EDUC-UK, V49, P215, DOI 10.1111/eie.1207; Maley A., 2018, CREATIV THEORY, V7, P97; Mir M, 2019, HUMOR, V32, P393, DOI 10.1515/humor-2017-012; Ono Y, 2015, ELECTR ENG JPN, V192, P1, DOI 10.1002/eej.2271; Rozumko A, 2016, LANG CONTRAST, V16, P239, DOI 10.1075/lic.16.2.04ro; Shishavan HB, 2016, LANG COMMUN, V47, P75, DOI 10.1016/j.langcom.2016.01.00; Sulmont-Rosse C, 2019, FOOD RES INT, V115, P292, DOI 10.1016/j.foodres.2018.12.01; Sundberg R, 2019, COMPUT ASSIST LANG L, V32, P49, DOI 10.1080/09588221.2018.147261; van der Merwe, 2015, TEACHING PRACTICE 21, V3, P190, DOI 10.13189/ujer.2015.03030; Wang J., 2018, THEORY PRACT LANG ST, V8, P127; Xu JF, 2015, SYSTEM, V49, P50, DOI 10.1016/j.system.2014.10.01; Yao D., 2015, OVERSEAS ENGL, V80, pS3; Zhang T., 2016, INT TECHNOL MANAG, P3",25,1,1,9,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In recent years, Sang subculture has evolved from a form of network subculture that initially aroused the inner resonance and self-deprecation of middle school and college students, and has developed into a complete industrial chain formed under the combined effect of the deliberate catering of online media and the active marketing of businesses. Its existence eventually caused the mainstream ideology to be impacted, and the ideals, beliefs and value choices of some students were greatly affected. This article takes Sang language as an anchor, pays attention to the thought changes and behavior characteristics of middle school and college students, as well as the channels and methods of Sang language and subculture communication, and then deeply analyzes its motivation. This article finds that Sang language, due to its inherent unique form of mimicry, reflects the emotional and rational characteristics of youth groups in the process of socialization.

The structure of GIS is compact, the floor area is small, the configuration is flexible and the reliability is high. Moreover, it has strong security and strong environmental adaptability. However, the electric field strength in GIS is very strong, once there are some defects in the equipment, partial discharge will occur, resulting in insulation deterioration of GIS equipment. In this paper, positioning detection technology is used, A fast live detection method of power equipment in complex area based on lilac is proposed. The position of the discharge source is roughly located, and then the linear electron accelerator is used to accurately locate the partial discharge source, which improves the efficiency of defect location. Based on the linear electron accelerator, GIS signal detection device is studied. In the detection, it is necessary to obtain the data generated by partial discharge signal, high-frequency current data and data for comparative analysis, so as to effectively eliminate the interference signal in GIS field, and improve the accuracy and defect type identification.","[Wang, Zhichuan] State Grid Sichuan Elect Power Co, Chengdu 610000, Peoples R China","Wang, ZC (corresponding author), State Grid Sichuan Elect Power Co, Chengdu 610000, Peoples R China.",zhichuan@outlook.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [111578109],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant: 111578109).","Avagyan R, 2014, NUCL MED BIOL, V41, P705, DOI 10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2014.04.13; Brown G, 2014, APPL GEOGR, V46, P122, DOI 10.1016/j.apgeog.2013.11.00; Brown G, 2014, LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN, V121, P34, DOI 10.1016/j.landurbplan.2013.09.00; Bunting P, 2014, COMPUT GEOSCI-UK, V62, P216, DOI 10.1016/j.cageo.2013.08.00; Ding Dengwei, 2014, High Voltage Apparatus, V50, P1; Duan D., 2017, HIGH VOLT APPAR, V53, P11; Feizizadeh B, 2014, COMPUT GEOSCI-UK, V73, P208, DOI 10.1016/j.cageo.2014.08.00; Ghasemi F, 2015, NUCL INSTRUM METH A, V772, P52, DOI 10.1016/j.nima.2014.10.03; Jarnevich CS, 2010, INVAS PLANT SCI MANA, V3, P365, DOI 10.1614/IPSM-08-073.; Joseph M, 2014, HABITAT INT, V41, P33, DOI 10.1016/j.habitatint.2013.06.00; Khankin VV, 2020, MOSC U PHYS B+, V75, P52, DOI 10.3103/S002713492001008; Kim SH, 2020, J KOREAN PHYS SOC, V76, P617, DOI 10.3938/jkps.76.61; Lee DM, 2018, ENERG FUEL, V32, P10556, DOI 10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b0236; Lisciandro GR, 2016, J VET EMERG CRIT CAR, V26, P125, DOI 10.1111/vec.1237; [律方成 Lu Fangcheng], 2014, [电工技术学报, Transactions of China Electrotechnical Society], V29, P33; Mergili M, 2014, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V206, P178, DOI 10.1016/j.geomorph.2013.10.00; Nikiforov DA, 2020, PHYS PART NUCLEI LET, V17, P197, DOI 10.1134/S154747712002015; OTSUKA K, 1994, JPN J APPL PHYS 1, V33, P5933, DOI 10.1143/JJAP.33.593; Plath T, 2016, J SYNCHROTRON RADIAT, V23, P1070, DOI 10.1107/S160057751600962; Sahani G, 2014, J MED PHYS, V39, P206, DOI 10.4103/0971-6203.14448; Staal SJ, 2002, AGR ECON, V27, P295, DOI 10.1111/j.1574-0862.2002.tb00122.; Storck P, 1998, HYDROL PROCESS, V12, P889, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1085(199805)12:6&lt;889::AID-HYP661&gt;3.0.CO;2-; vanWesten CJ, 1996, EARTH SURF PROCESSES, V21, P853, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9837(199609)21:9&lt;853::AID-ESP676&gt;3.0.CO;2-; Whelan B, 2016, MED PHYS, V43, P1285, DOI 10.1118/1.494130; Xu Qingxu, MED EQUIPMENT, V1996000, P; Yang F, 2019, RUSS J ELECTROCHEM+, V55, P222, DOI 10.1134/S102319351902016; Yassemi S, 2008, ECOL MODEL, V210, P71, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2007.07.02; Yuvaraja T, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P348, DOI 10.1177/002072091881599; [朱庆 Zhu Qing], 2014, [地球信息科学学报, Journal of Geo-Information Science], V16, P15",29,0,0,2,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Intelligent Tutoring Systems ( ITSs ) are a critical category of a carrier of online education which refers to using Artificial Intelligence Technology ( AIT ) to realize distance teaching and learning through integrating multiple resources, assist teachers to implement online classes and help students learn courses online, etc. The target of this study is to examine the determinants that explain college students' adoption of ITSs based on TRA and TAM under the era of COVID-19 in China.. This study targets college students who have used ITSs over the previous year to learn courses. In total, 590 valid samples were collected. Partial least squares ( PLS ) approach is employed to inspect the determinants of college students' acceptance of using ITSs. The results of the analysis indicate that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, subjective norm, college students' attitude and political influence significantly affect college students' behavioral intention towards using ITSs. In addition, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and political influence also affect college students' attitude toward using ITSs. And consisitent with previous research, perceived ease of use has a significant effects on perceived usefulness. This study enriches the TRA and TAM theories by incorporating a new variable political influence for researchers to consider in the future. In addition, it makes several suggestions for system developers to improve system functions regarding its ease of use and for content manufactures to pay attention to quality regarding usefulness. Recommendations are provided to colleges, universities and education authorities to rethink their roles in reforming online education through ITSs.","[Cao, Jijuan; Wu, Jun] Guangzhou Panyu Polytech, Sch Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Cao, Jijuan; Lai, Ivan Ka-Wai] City Univ Macau, Fac Int Tourism & Management, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R China; [Yang, Ting] Jinan Univ, Int Business Sch, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Wu, J (corresponding author), Guangzhou Panyu Polytech, Guangzhou 511483, Peoples R China.",87442733@qq.com,,,Youth Program of The Education Science Planning Department in Guangzhou [202012523]; Major Scientific Research Platform Cultivation Project of Guangzhou Panyu Polytechnic [2017Y01PY]; Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project of Guangzhou Education Bureau [2019PT102]; Major Projects of Guangdong Provincial Department of Education [2017GWTSCX028],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported in part by the Youth Program of The Education Science Planning Department in Guangzhou under Grant 202012523, Major Scientific Research Platform Cultivation Project of Guangzhou Panyu Polytechnic under Grant 2017Y01PY, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project of Guangzhou Education Bureau under Grant 2019PT102, and Major Projects of Guangdong Provincial Department of Education under Grant 2017GWTSCX028.","Abidin Jasbirizla Ilia Zainal, 2017, Advances in Visual Informatics. 5th International Visual Informatics Conference, IVIC 2017.

The proposed high-efficiency and compact WPT receiving antenna consists of a spiral structure, a lumped element and via through the ground structure. In this paper, in order to design a miniaturized high-efficiency WPT receiving antenna, machine learning technology was used to optimally design the antenna pattern that affects the Q factor. The designed receiving antenna has improved wireless power transmission efficiency with high Q characteristics. The power transfer efficiency is above 88% from distance 10 mm and the resonant frequency is 110 MHz. The sizes of the receiving antenna and the NFC antenna are 30 x 40 mm and 20 x 30 mm, respectively. Machine learning was used to design and fabricate the composite module of a WPT receiving antenna and NFC antenna. Comparison of the experimental results of the proposed receiving antenna with a general receiving antenna confirms the improvement in transmission efficiency.","[Kim, Yanghyun] Soongsil Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Seo, Chulhun] Soongsil Univ, Dept Informat & Telecommun Engn, 511 Sangdo Dong, Seoul 156743, South Korea","Seo, C (corresponding author), Soongsil Univ, Dept Informat & Telecommun Engn, 511 Sangdo Dong, Seoul 156743, South Korea.",chulhun@ssu.ac.kr,"KIM, Yanghyun/ABC-3848-2021","KIM, Yanghyun/0000-0001-5661-6283",,,"Antonino-Daviu JA, 2014, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V51, P68, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.51.1.; Choi J, 2010, PROG ELECTROMAGN RES, V106, P33, DOI 10.2528/PIER1005060; Chu Y, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072092091815; Drieberg M, 2013, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V50, P368, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.50.4.; Fotopoulou K, 2011, IEEE T MAGN, V47, P416, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2010.209353; Haigh K.Z., 2015, MACHINE LEARNING EM; Huang D, 2012, J APPL PHYS, V111, DOI 10.1063/1.369275; Itoh R, 2014, 2014 IEEE 3RD GLOBAL CONFERENCE ON CONSUMER ELECTRONICS (GCCE), P459, DOI 10.1109/GCCE.2014.703127; Karalis A, 2008, ANN PHYS-NEW YORK, V323, P34, DOI 10.1016/j.aop.2007.04.01; Kurs A, 2007, SCIENCE, V317, P83, DOI 10.1126/science.114325; Riba JR, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V57, P230, DOI 10.1177/002072091880044; Sun Z, 2010, PROG ELECTROMAGN RES, V103, P1, DOI 10.2528/PIER1002260; Tesla N., 1905, TRANSMISSION ELECT E, P2",13,1,1,2,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

J,"Gao, C1;  Jin, YZ",,,,Gao Chao; Jin Yinzhen,,,On the direction of talent training of design education from the perspective of the characteristics of design disciplines,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION,,,English,Article; Early Access,,,,,,Design discipline; Professional direction; Design education; Cultivation of talents,,"This paper will analyze by analogy, the internal relationship between different design majors is clarified on the basis of discussing the characteristics of design disciplines, and then the talent cultivation direction of design education is discussed. From the point of view of the characteristics of design as a subject, the discipline of design is comprehensive and application-oriented. It is comprehensive as it involves different types of disciplines such as technical skills, abstract concepts and theoretical knowledge, and different types of knowledge such as knowledge about practical skills, human thinking and information, as well as different types of capabilities such as professional skills, creative thinking, knowledge acquisition and application. The knowledge structure of the design subject consists of three dimensions, the thinking level, knowledge level and technical level. The inherent connections of the different branches of the design discipline are as follows: they are interconnected on the thinking level, related on the knowledge level and different on the skill level. The knowledge and abilities on these three dimensions compose the design skills designers should acquire, among which the thinking level serves as the foundational and core piece. Therefore, the design education reform should focus on cultivating students' abilities, especially students' thinking skills. Then, it can be concluded that design education should not emphasize the difference of design direction, but should pay attention to the training of students' design ability instead of the training of students' skills, especially the training of students' thinking ability.","[Gao Chao] Jingdezhen Ceram Inst, Grad Sch, Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Jin Yinzhen] Jingdezhen Ceram Inst, Sch Arts & Archaeol, Jingdezhen 333000, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","Jin, YZ (corresponding author), Jingdezhen Ceram Inst, Sch Arts & Archaeol, Jingdezhen 333000, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",327016271@qq.com,,,,,"Abdelaziz AY., 2018, CLASSICAL RECENT ASP, DOI DOI 10.1016/B978-0-12-812441-3.00016-; [Anonymous], 2016, JAPAN HUGO SARRAZIN, P7; Brown Bruce, 2016, DESIGN PROBLEMS, VI, P; Ezio M., 2016, EVERYBODY DESIGNS AN, P4; Fung CH, 2020, TECHNOL KNOWL LEARN, V25, P479, DOI 10.1007/s10758-020-09443-; Hang J., 2018, GIST CHINESE DESIGN, P1; Hight C, 2006, ARCHIT DESIGN, P; John D., 2014, TRANSLATED WU ZHONGY, P4; John H., 2013, DESIGN VERY SHORT I; Klaus L., 2016, DESIGN ED ED DESIGN, P3; Klaus L., 2016, DESIGN ED EDUCATIO; Kuzle A, 2017, TECHNOL KNOWL LEARN, V22, P37, DOI 10.1007/s10758-016-9284-; Li K, 2019, OPEN ED RES, V25, P66, DOI DOI 10.13966/J.CNKI.KFJYYJ.2019.04.00; Li L., 2005, INTRO ART DESIGN, P2; Li Y., 2012, THEORY METHOD PRODUC, P1; Li Y., 2019, DESIGN DIMENSIONS, P; Liu G., 2019, DESIGN METHODOLOGY, P3; Liu G., 2019, DESIGN METHODOLOGY, P4; Liu X., 2006, DESIGN THINKING, P1; Moore Brooke Noel, 2018, CRITICAL THINKING, P; Paul A., 2009, P 8 EUR AC DES C AB, P3; Ray K., 2013, CREATE THINKING MYST, P2; Robert F., 2010, OXFORD HDB INTERDIS; Rodgers PA., 2008, PERIMETERS BOUNDARIE, P; Tang X, 2019, IND DESIGN MAG, V1, P3; THISTLEWOOD D, 1988, J ART DESIGN EDUC, V7, P37, DOI 10.1111/j.1476-8070.1988.tb00730.; Valerie B., 2010, TACKLING WICKED PRO; Xie H., 2020, ED MODERNIZATION, V1, P4; Yi Z., 2019, J ART ED, V4, P16; Zhao W., 2018, ED TREND ARTS DESIGN, V4, P14; Zhu S., 2018, J ART DESIGN, V1, P10",31,0,0,12,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The four-coil configuration has the advantage of open space and good uniformity. Traditional schemes include Lee-Whiting, Tetracoil, Braunbeck, etc. The first two schemes have rounding errors of coil turns. The Braunbeck configuration avoids rounding errors, but the structure is solidified and cannot meet the requirements of flexible sensors. In this study, we derive a general constraint equation that fits various four-coil configurations and show that the constraint parameter uniquely defines the configuration. Moreover, we develop a simple optimization approach that allows building the optimized configuration that lacks rounding errors of coil turns. We analyzed system performance for different coil cross sections and configurations. The comparison of the original Lee-Whiting and optimized coils revealed that the normalized maximum radius R-max increased by 7.67%. Finally, the increase in cross-section resulted in performance that was principally different from classical models. The proposed approach makes both scientific and educational contributions for future studies.","[Hu, Liangliang; Xu, Jinzhang] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Instrument Sci & Optoelect Engn, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jinzhang; Zhang, Xun; Hu, Zongyuan] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Qu, Zheng] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Nucl Sci & Technol, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China","Xu, JZ (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.;Xu, JZ (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.",xujz@hfut.edu.cn,,"Hu, Liangliang/0000-0002-1803-6269","National Natural Science Foundation of China [81527802, 12075072]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 81527802 and No. 12075072.","Alvarez A.

The purpose of this research is to deeply study the effective mechanism of my country's vocational education reform to promote precision industry poverty alleviation, and investigate the financial aid for poor students and the number of aids of a secondary vocational college for 5 consecutive years. Investigate the number of registered poor agricultural households in a city for five consecutive years, the number of rural labor transfers in employment, and the growth of per capita income of farmers. Taking 100 poor families in a poverty-stricken county as an example to investigate and analyze the educational background, knowledge level and attitudes of parents and students to school. Investigate various major local technical trainings conducted in a city for 5 consecutive years. The results show that the poverty subsidy of vocational schools has increased year by year, and the number of poverty subsidies has also increased. Among them, the intensity of targeted poverty alleviation has also been continuously strengthened. The dynamic management of information on the establishment of filing cards has greatly improved the precision of poverty alleviation and realized dynamic management. Per capita income has also achieved steady growth. At the same time, most parents have a junior high school diploma, and the student's academic qualifications are generally not high. In view of the attitude to school, most parents believe that it is very necessary, but the students think that they can not go up. There are more and more people participating in the main technical training in various localities, and more and more training projects are taking place, and the proportion is gradually increasing. These jobs are of great significance to the development of today's society.","[Xu, Chunqiu] Changchun Univ Technol, Coll Humanities & Informat, Sch Finance, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yang] Changchun Univ Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp 3, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China","Xu, CQ (corresponding author), Changchun Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Humanities & Informat, Sch Business, Changchun 130000, Jilin, Peoples R China.",172740537@qq.com,,,Jilin province social science fund Subject: Research on Vocational and Technical Education in Jilin Province Promotes the Targeted Poverty Alleviation [2019B102],This work was supported by Jilin province social science fund Subject: Research on Vocational and Technical Education in Jilin Province Promotes the Targeted Poverty Alleviation (2019B102).,"Alcantara-Silva TR, 2018, INTEGR CANCER THER, V17, P628, DOI 10.1177/153473541875734; Atlasi Y, 2017, NAT REV GENET, V18, DOI 10.1038/nrg.2017.5; Burt RS, 1997, ADMIN SCI QUART, V42, P339, DOI 10.2307/239392; Busse R, 2017, LANCET, V390, P882, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31280-; Caragiannis I, 2019, THEOR COMPUT SYST, V63, P114, DOI 10.1007/s00224-018-9857-; Chakrabarti A, 2017, J INT TRADE ECON DEV, V26, P111, DOI 10.1080/09638199.2016.122097; Church JA., 2019, DTTP, V47, P; Clark AE, 2016, REV ECON STAT, V98, P591, DOI 10.1162/REST_a_0054; Davis LL, 2018, JAMA PSYCHIAT, V75, P316, DOI 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.447; Du Y., 2017, HEILONGJIANG NATL SE, V000, P5; Hanushek EA, 2017, J HUM RESOUR, V52, P48, DOI 10.3368/jhr.52.1.0415-7074; Le GL., 2016, S AFR J HIGH ED, V30, P; Li CF, 2016, J HENAN U SCI TECHNO, V36, P; Liang ZengXian, 2018, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, V26, P1984, DOI 10.1080/09669582.2018.152629; Makarana G, 2019, INDIAN J AGR SCI, V89, P62; Oladipo SO., 2018, AFRICAN J APPL RES A, V3, P9; Orsdemir A, 2019, M&SOM-MANUF SERV OP, V21, P674, DOI 10.1287/msom.2018.071; Pillay-van Wyk V, 2017, LANCET GLOB HEALTH, V5, pE851, DOI 10.1016/S2214-109X(17)30304-; STEVENS RA, 1978, J MED EDUC, V53, P; Tavrow P., 2018, J COMMUNITY PREVENTI, V1, P; Thomas HS, 2019, BRIT J SURG, V106, pE103, DOI 10.1002/bjs.1105; Virtanen M, 2018, LANCET PUBLIC HEALTH, V3, pE558, DOI 10.1016/S2468-2667(18)30237-; Wang YY, 2016, P I MECH ENG M-J ENG, V230, P3, DOI 10.1177/147509021559046; Wren MA, 2019, HEALTH ECON POLICY L, V14, P355, DOI 10.1017/S174413311700027; Zhou P, 2018, NUCL INSTRUM METH B, V423, P37, DOI 10.1016/j.nimb.2018.03.00",25,1,1,23,65,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

However, under the guidance of the America First principle, its economic policies have involved the domestic manufacturing backflow and international trade protectionism, which has led to the rise of unilateralism and local protectionism. These have caused Chinese labor-intensive industries, which leverage the comparative advantages of Chinese economy, to have fallen into development dilemma. From economic comparative advantage perspective, this paper analyzes the importance of labor-intensive industries in Chinese economic transformations, weighs the dilemmas and opportunities of these industries under the influential trade protection policies, and considers adjusting their factor endowments like personnels and capitals. To matain vitality and promote industrial upgradings, the financial and talents-educational policies of the market and government should seek sustainable strategies to guide this type of industry.

By measuring the overall distance between Internet financial credit reporting through the sparse large data with multidimensional attributes, the multidimensional attribute sparse large data are used to perform clustering analysis on the overall distance matrix and the component approximate distance matrix between the data, respectively. The correlation relationship between the Internet financial credit reporting under these two perspectives is taken into comprehensive consideration. Multidimensional attribute sparse large data pairs are used to reflect the comprehensive relationship matrix of the original Internet financial credit reporting to achieve clustering with relatively high quality. Numerical experiments show that compared with the traditional clustering methods, the method proposed in this paper can not only reflect the overall data features effectively, but also improve the clustering effect of the original Internet financial credit reporting data through the analysis of the correlation relationship between the important component attribute sequences.","[Chen, Lingling; Zhang, Yuanyuan] North China Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Langfang, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Min] Pingxiang Univ, Sch Business, Pingxiang 337000, Peoples R China","Zeng, M (corresponding author), Pingxiang Univ, Sch Business, Pingxiang 337000, Peoples R China.",zelizer@163.com,"Chen, Ling-Ling/AAY-3547-2021",,,,"Ahadi M, 2016, IEEE T COMPUT AID D, V35, P1640, DOI 10.1109/TCAD.2016.252771; Alania M, 2017, ULTRAMICROSCOPY, V181, P134, DOI 10.1016/j.ultramic.2016.12.01; Copp SM, 2015, ACS NANO, V9, P2303, DOI 10.1021/nn506322; Fang WH, 2017, CHEM MATER, V29, P2681, DOI 10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b0032; Hartstra IE, 2017, GEOPHYS J INT, V210, P609, DOI 10.1093/gji/ggx12; Jimeno P, 2017, MON NOT R ASTRON SOC, V466, P2658, DOI 10.1093/mnras/stw325; Jumah B, 2014, GEOPHYS PROSPECT, V62, P972, DOI 10.1111/1365-2478.1211; Konakli K, 2016, J COMPUT PHYS, V321, P1144, DOI 10.1016/j.jcp.2016.06.00; Korats G, 2015, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V6; Mobli M, 2015, J MAGN RESON, V256, P60, DOI 10.1016/j.jmr.2015.04.00; Murata N, 2018, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V66, P3327, DOI 10.1109/TSP.2018.283031; Rauh A, 2017, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V65, P162, DOI 10.1109/TSP.2016.259948; Schuyler AD, 2015, J MAGN RESON, V254, P121, DOI 10.1016/j.jmr.2015.02.01; Stoyanov MK, 2016, COMPUT MATH APPL, V71, P2449, DOI 10.1016/j.camwa.2015.12.04; Wang J, 2015, IEEE T VEH TECHNOL, V64, P356, DOI 10.1109/TVT.2014.231808; Yuvaraja T, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V57, P164, DOI 10.1177/002072091881380",16,0,0,6,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The results show that there is a significant double threshold effect between rural human capital and AGTFP under different levels of agricultural material capital (AF)and agricultural economic development (AGDP). When AF and AGDP are at different levels, the relationship between rural human capital and AGTFP presents an inverse N-type trend or an inverted U-type trend. The nonlinear relationship between rural human capital and AGTFP has been verified. It is necessary to attach importance to the promotion of agricultural human capital to the growth of AGTFP. It is suggested to strengthen education on environmental protection and green production technology training for farmers, and urge them to widely adopt the production mode of mitigating climate warming. In addition, it is important to ensure the coordinated development of AF and rural human capital while enhancing the input of AF.","[Liu, Fang] Anhui Polytech Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhu, Peoples R China; [Lv, Ning] Shihezi Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Lv, Ning] Xinjiang Acad Agr & Reclamat Sci, Xinjiang 832000, Shihezi, Peoples R China","Lv, N (corresponding author), Xinjiang Acad Agr & Reclamat Sci, Xinjiang 832000, Shihezi, Peoples R China.",gege899@126.com,,,"Youth Project of Philosophy and Social Science of Anhui Province, China [AHSKQ2019D014]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work in the paper was supported by the Youth Project of Philosophy and Social Science of Anhui Province, China (No. AHSKQ2019D014).","Ang F, 2017, EUR J OPER RES, V260, P359, DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2016.12.01; [Anonymous], 1989, HUMAN CAPITAL GROWTH, DOI DOI 10.1016/0167-2231(90)90028-; Attanasio O, 2017, REV ECON DYNAM, V25, P234, DOI 10.1016/j.red.2017.02.00; Cecchini L, 2018, J CLEAN PROD, V197, P895, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.06.16; Chen Y., 2011, CHINA POPUL RESOUR E, V21, P15; Fare R, 2005, J ECONOMETRICS, V126, P469, DOI 10.1016/j.jeconom.2004.05.01; Han HB, 2018, ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R, V25, P32096, DOI 10.1007/s11356-018-3142-; Hansen BE, 1999, J ECONOMETRICS, V93, P345, DOI 10.1016/S0304-4076(99)00025-; Li B, 2017, J CLEAN PROD, V153, P342, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.10.04; Liu Y, 2019, RESOUR CONSERV RECY, V147, P201, DOI 10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.04.01; Liu Z, 2021, INT J PROD ECON, V233, DOI 10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.10799; Lu XH, 2020, LAND USE POLICY, V95, DOI 10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.10461; Qi Y., 2019, P 2019 INT C IND, P; Wang Q., 2012, ECON REV, V5, P2; Wang SL, 2014, ENERG ECON, V46, P435, DOI 10.1016/j.eneco.2014.05.00; Xia F, 2020, CHINA ECON REV, V62, DOI 10.1016/j.chieco.2020.10145; Yan ZM, 2020, ENERG ECON, V90, DOI 10.1016/j.eneco.2020.10484; Yaqubi M, 2016, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V556, P310, DOI 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.02.19; Yin ZJ, 2017, J S CHINA AGR U, V16, P2; Zhang H., 2018, CHEM ENG TRANS, V66, P55; Zhang JunXia, 2011, Journal of Northeast Agricultural University (English Edition), V18, P77, DOI 10.1016/S1006-8104(12)60029-; Zhao L., 2013, CHINA POPUL RESOUR E, V23, P7; Zheng XX, 2019, INT J PROD ECON, V212, P92, DOI 10.1016/j.ijpe.2019.01.01",23,3,3,18,46,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This paper uses ADAMS dynamic analysis software to carry out CFD simulation test on ball exercise equipment, and explore the influence of different parameters on the air movement of ball equipment. The results are as follows: (1) the factors that affect the track of rhythmic gymnastics ball in the air are the mass, volume, velocity of the ball, as well as the forces of the ball in the air. (2) The rotation speed of the ball is an important factor affecting the lateral bending degree of the track of rhythmic gymnastics ball. The rotation speed and the air pressure difference between the left and right sides of the ball are directly proportional to the curvature of the running track.(3) The gliding performance of rhythmic gymnastics ball mainly depends on the value of lift drag ratio, which has an important influence on the flight height and flight time of the ball, and its size changes with the attack angle. And there are some suggestions: rhythmic gymnastics ball in the air belongs to non dynamic flight. It is suggested that in practice, the athlete should consider a series of factors, such as the initial velocity of the ball, the throwing angle and the height of the shooting point, so as to effectively control the flight radian, distance and height of the artistic gymnastics ball.","[Ren Qihong] Xinjiang Normal Univ, Inst Phys Educ, Urumqi, Peoples R China","Ren, QH (corresponding author), Xinjiang Normal Univ, Inst Phys Educ, Urumqi, Peoples R China.",58505203@qq.com,,,Xinjiang Social Science Fund Project Research on the integration of cultural courtyard and mass sports from the perspective of Fanghuiju [19BTY097],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Project Name: Xinjiang Social Science Fund Project Research on the integration of cultural courtyard and mass sports from the perspective of Fanghuiju; project number: 19BTY097.","Aming L., 2019, SPORT BIOMECH, P20; Gao Z., 2017, FLUID MECH-SOV RES, V1, P; GRIFFITHS MA, 1993, J AM COLL NUTR, V12, P15; Sakamoto S, 2020, ACOUST SCI TECHNOL, V41, P529, DOI 10.1250/ast.41.52; Wang F., 2004, COMPUTATIONAL FLUID, P14; Wei Y., 2020, INTRO MECH, P3; Zaiyou Y., 2018, AERODYNAMICS, P; Zhao h., 2008, SPORT BIOMECH, P16",8,0,0,1,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Based on competency theory, this paper investigates the influence of competency dimensions and work meaning on performance. Through the competency questionnaire analysis of 224 shop managers in apprentice project enterprises, it is found that: the part of the competency dimension of personality traits, motivation and values hidden in the iceberg model has a significant impact on performance through work meaning; the relationship between work values and work meaning of apprentices is stronger, and that the relationship between work motivation and work meaning of non-apprentices is stronger. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the cultivation of multiple values of apprenticeship, especially the significance of moral education. The results provide reference for upgrading the quality of talent training in Colleges, reconstructing talent training objectives and the practice of human resource management in enterprises.","[Wang Shuwei; Zhang Yong] Guangzhou Panyu Polytech, Guangzhou 510000, Peoples R China","Zhang, Y (corresponding author), Guangzhou Panyu Polytech, Guangzhou 510000, Peoples R China.",314556782@qq.com,,,Guangzhou key Research Base of Humanities and Social Sciences Guangzhou Research Base for Cooperative training of High-tech talents [2]; Training Practice of Competency of Modern Apprenticeship Students in Higher Vocational Colleges and 13th five year plan of Education Science in Guangdong Province [2020gxjk518],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This paper was supported by Guangzhou key Research Base of Humanities and Social Sciences Guangzhou Research Base for Cooperative training of High-tech talents (Base No. 2 Co-construction of key Research Base), Training Practice of Competency of Modern Apprenticeship Students in Higher Vocational Colleges and 13th five year plan of Education Science in Guangdong Province (2020gxjk518) The value orientation and logical evolution of specialty construction in Higher Vocational Colleges from the perspective of modern apprenticeship.","[Anonymous], 2020, THE PEOPLES DAIL; Feng X., 2011, SOCIAL SCI RES, V03, P8; Gagne M, 1997, J APPL SOC PSYCHOL, V27, P1222, DOI 10.1111/j.1559-1816.1997.tb01803.; Gagne M, 2010, EDUC PSYCHOL MEAS, V70, P628, DOI 10.1177/001316440935569; Gosling SD, 2003, J RES PERS, V37, P504, DOI 10.1016/S0092-6566(03)00046-; Grant AM, 2008, J APPL PSYCHOL, V93, P108, DOI 10.1037/0021-9010.93.1.10; Li C., 2011, ACTA PSYCHOL SIN, V38, P9; MCCLELLAND DC, 1973, AM PSYCHOL, V28, P1, DOI 10.1037/h003409; Peng F., 2008, BUSINESS MODERNIZATI, V10, P6; Ranxin L., 2012, LIAONING EC, V12, P8; Shi WP, 2015, VOCATIONAL ED FORUM, V01, P6; Tu Y., 2014, J PSYCHOL, V46, P823, DOI DOI 10.3724/SP.J.1041.2014.0082; Wang S., 2019, VOCATIONAL TECHNICAL, V10, P2; West SG., 1991, MULTIPLE REGRESSIO; Xiang Q., 2008, COMPETENCY MODEL MAR, P4; Yao K., 2009, J MANAGE, V6, P53; Zhao P., 2013, CHINA VOCATIONAL ED, V12, P3",17,0,0,7,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The research on the evaluation of English teaching quality is of crucial practical significance and theoretical value. Hence, student evaluation form for the college English classroom teaching quality that has been evaluated and has good reliability is used in this paper to expound the principles of the triangular fuzzy number evaluation method and the range method based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Examples are used to analyze the differences between the two methods as well as their advantages and disadvantages. The comprehensive evaluation result of the teaching quality evaluation of a teacher by using the range method is excellent (85.500 points), and the comprehensive evaluation result by using the triangular fuzzy number method based on the analytic hierarchy process is good (64.818 points). The results show that the range method is better for the comprehensive evaluation of teachers' teaching quality. The statistical analysis results suggest that there are differences between the two methods in the evaluation of the classroom teaching quality in colleges and universities (t = 11.197, P < 0.0001). In the evaluation of the teaching quality by using the triangular fuzzy number evaluation method based on the analytic hierarchy process, the non-linear and fuzzy features of evaluation factors are taken into consideration comprehensively. The weight values of various evaluation indexes are calculated scientifically. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations are combined to obtain the evaluation result of the classroom teaching quality of teachers more objectively, which is of great significance in the practical teaching quality evaluation process.","[Xie, Zhixian] Changchun Univ, Foreign Language Dept, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Su, Zheqian] Changchun Univ Chinese Med, Foreign Language Dept, Changchun 130117, Jilin, Peoples R China","Su, ZQ (corresponding author), Changchun Univ Chinese Med, Foreign Language Dept, Changchun 130117, Jilin, Peoples R China.",suzheqian@sohu.com,,,Apricot Woods Scholar Project 2019 -Young Scientist Project in Changchun University of Chinese Medicine; Jilin Province Vocational Education and Adult Education Teaching Reform Research Project:Study on The Multi-modal Chained Learning Model of Traditional Chinese Medicine English based on Mobile Internet Environment [2020ZCY345],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Apricot Woods Scholar Project 2019 -Young Scientist Project in Changchun University of Chinese Medicine; Jilin Province Vocational Education and Adult Education Teaching Reform Research Project:Study on The Multi-modal Chained Learning Model of Traditional Chinese Medicine English based on Mobile Internet Environment (NO.2020ZCY345).","Dawn W, 2017, J CLIN MICROBIOL, V45, P110; Hassinger TE, 2018, J AM COLL SURGEONS, V227, pS76, DOI 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2018.07.15; Hathuc VM, 2017, MODERN PATHOL, V30, p508; Karamchandani DM, 2015, VIRCHOWS ARCH, V466, P279, DOI 10.1007/s00428-014-1714-; Lagerberg JW, 2015, TRANSFUSION, V55, P522, DOI 10.1111/trf.1287; Macdonald C., 2015, CAN J FOREST RES, V34, P133; Milan SA, 2016, J AM COLL SURGEONS, V223, pE178, DOI 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2016.08.45; Mostafavi M, 2015, ANIM PROD SCI, V55, P1005, DOI 10.1071/AN1410; Schendel E, 2017, ONCOGENE, V19, P199; Sharma N, 2018, MED EDUC, V48, P1; Sonawane PR, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V57, P272, DOI 10.1177/002072091881383; Vercheval C, 2016, EUR J CLIN MICROBIOL, V35, P1495, DOI 10.1007/s10096-016-2690-; Wang K, 2015, ATMOS ENVIRON, V115, P587, DOI 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.07.04; Wellein MG, 2009, AM J PHARM EDUC, V73, DOI 10.5688/aj73057; Zhuo D, 2015, PEDIATR RES, V32, P60",15,4,4,4,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Being able to predict future stock price in a relatively accurate way forms a significant task of stock market analysis. Different mechanisms from fundamental analysis to statistical modeling have been deployed to study stock market performance and various factors from fundamental factors, technical factors to market sentiments are also incorporated in the stock price prediction task. However, due to the chaotic stock market performance, which is close to random walk, and the difficulty in discerning influential factors, predicting stock price faces a lot of challenges. In recent years, fast development in fields such as machine learning has offered new ways to look at this task. In this paper, we employ Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm, a recent modification of traditional feedforward neural network with single hidden layer, whose learning speed is greatly improved based on solid mathematical background and capability to circumvent problems such as local minimum is also enhanced, to construct an ELM combination model to study stock market performance and predict stock price. A comparison between the predicted output and the real data is carried out to test the feasibility of applying ELM model to stock market analysis. The result indicates that ELM model is desirable for predicting stock price variation trend while some inaccuracy exists in the prediction of peak values, which may require further model modification. Overall, by applying the machine learning model ELM to predict stock price and generating desirable outcome, this paper both contributes to offering a new way to investigate stock market performance and enlarging the field deployment of ELM model as well.","[Zhang, Fangzhao] Univ British Columbia, Math & CS Dept, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Zhang, FZ (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Math & CS Dept, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",fangzhao.zh@gmail.com,,,,,"Chang Y, 2009, JILIANG XUEBAO, V30, P32; FAMA EF, 1970, J FINANC, V25, P383, DOI 10.2307/232548; Gandoman FH, 2017, INT T ELECTR ENERGY, V27, DOI 10.1002/etep.239; Guo Z, 2017, INT J AGR BIOL ENG, V10, P251, DOI 10.25165/j.ijabe.20171005.286; HORNIK K, 1991, NEURAL NETWORKS, V4, P251, DOI 10.1016/0893-6080(91)90009-; Huang GB, 1998, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V9, P224, DOI 10.1109/72.65504; Huang GB, 2006, NEUROCOMPUTING, V70, P489, DOI 10.1016/j.neucom.2005.12.12; Kumar A, 2015, 2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN CONTROL, AUTOMATION AND POWER ENGINEERING (RDCAPE), P292, DOI 10.1109/RDCAPE.2015.728141; LESHNO M, 1993, NEURAL NETWORKS, V6, P861, DOI 10.1016/S0893-6080(05)80131-; Li Yong-Jun, 2006, Control Theory & Applications, V23, P80; Mao KZ, 2002, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V13, P1211, DOI 10.1109/TNN.2002.103195; MCCULLOCH WS, 1990, B MATH BIOL, V52, P99, DOI 10.1016/S0092-8240(05)80006-; Mohammed AA, 2011, PATTERN RECOGN, V44, P2588, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2011.03.01; Hanh NV, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P273, DOI 10.1177/002072091877305; Romero E, 2012, NEURAL NETWORKS, V25, P122, DOI 10.1016/j.neunet.2011.08.00; Rong HJ, 2009, IEEE T SYST MAN CY B, V39, P1067, DOI 10.1109/TSMCB.2008.201050; Tamura S, 1997, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V8, P251, DOI 10.1109/72.55766; Van Horne JamesC., 1967, FINANC ANAL J, V23, P87, DOI [10.2469/faj.v23.n6.87, DOI 10.2469/FAJ.V23.N6.87; Yu HH, 2012, INT SYM COMPUT INTEL, P531, DOI 10.1109/ISCID.2012.13",19,0,0,12,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

However, there are still many problems in the training of translators in colleges and universities in terms of teachers, teaching time and teaching mode. In the context of the era of big data, this article uses questionnaires and data analysis, starting from the PACTE translation ability model, combined with constructivist learning theory, blended learning theory, and instructional design theory to analyze the problems of undergraduate translation ability. This article conducts a questionnaire survey on the 2018 students of XX University's a major, and analyzes their English scores. Students' bilingual ability is weak, and it is difficult to consider translation under the influence of context in the translation process; their strategic ability is not ideal, and they lack the ability to solve problems when they encounter specific translation problems. The English performance of the experimental class students who have undergone English translation teaching for one semester is significantly better than the control class students who have not received English translation teaching. Teachers can combine teaching theories to design English translation teaching and cultivate students' awareness of comparative analysis in English learning. Teachers can cultivate students' English thinking ability, promote them to master English better, and help them improve their English application ability.","[Liu, Yue] Jilin Prov Econ Management Cadre Coll, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Bai, Hongyan] Shijiazhuang Tiedao Univ, Sifang Coll, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Bai, Hongyan] Shijiazhuang Tiedao Univ, Foreign Language Dept, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, Peoples R China","Bai, HY (corresponding author), Shijiazhuang Tiedao Univ, Sifang Coll, Shijiazhuang 050000, Hebei, Peoples R China.",hongyanbai@hotmail.com,,,,,"Adams M, 2017, TECHNOL INNOV MANAG, V7, P1; Alotaibi HM, 2017, ARAB WORLD ENGL J, V8, P319, DOI 10.24093/awej/vol8no3.2; Chen W, 2019, 2019 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTS, MANAGEMENT, EDUCATION AND INNOVATION (ICAMEI 2019), P344, DOI 10.23977/icamei.2019.06; Duan YQ, 2019, INT J INFORM MANAGE, V48, P63, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.01.02; Grisham William, 2017, J Undergrad Neurosci Educ, V16, pA6; Gutterman CL, 2017, BIG-DAMA '17: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 WORKSHOP ON BIG DATA ANALYTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING FOR DATA COMMUNICATION NETWORKS, P37, DOI 10.1145/3098593.309860; Hiley D, 2018, MUSIC LETT, V99, P471, DOI 10.1093/ml/gcy05; Hou H., 2017, J ED SCI HUNAN NORMA, V16, P69, DOI DOI 10.19503/J.CNKI.1671-6124.2017.05.01; Huda M, 2017, INT J EMERG TECHNOL, V12, P68, DOI 10.3991/ijet.v12i03.643; Jia C, 2019, J CHENGDU NORMAL U, V35, P11; Jin YH, 2020, MILITARY MED RES, V7, DOI 10.1186/s40779-020-0233-; Ke X., 2018, J HLONGJIANG VOCAT I, V31, P15; Lei Y., 2019, VOCAT TECHNOL, V18, P5; Li AF, 2015, J COMPUT, V10, P166, DOI 10.17706/jcp.10.3.166-17; Li J, 2015, PROCEEDINGS OF 2015 INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM - COLLEGE FOREIGN LANGUAGES EDUCATION REFORM AND INNOVATION, P1; Peng BZ, 2017, INT J EMERG TECHNOL, V12, P41, DOI 10.3991/ijet.v12.i09.748; Romero, 2017, THEORY PRACTICE LANG, V7, P96; Ruqing L, 2018, J CHONGQING COLL ELE, V27, P11; Siregar R., 2017, ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEA, V10, P175, DOI [10.5539/elt.v10n7p175, DOI 10.5539/ELT.V10N7P175; Sun H, 2019, INT J EMERG TECHNOL, V14, P182, DOI 10.3991/ijet.v14i17.1120; Thomas HS, 2019, BRIT J SURG, V106, pE103, DOI 10.1002/bjs.1105; Wang JF, 2019, ACS PHOTONICS, V6, P1736, DOI 10.1021/acsphotonics.9b0045; Wang K., 2017, SCI INNOV, V5, P26; Wang W, 2017, BIOMED ENVIRON SCI, V30, P570, DOI 10.3967/bes2017.07; Wen-Can LI., 2019, J ANHUI U TECHNOL, V36, P8; Xiao-Ting S, 2018, J XIANGNAN U, V39, P9; Xu LL, 2020, INNOV EDUC TEACH INT, V57, P724, DOI 10.1080/14703297.2019.159321; Yin H, 2014, IEEE NETWORK, V28, P14, DOI 10.1109/MNET.2014.686312; Yuan Y., 2019, TEACH FORESTRY REGIO, V32, P17; Yun-Cui Z, 2017, HLONGJIANG ENCE, V8, P3; Zhang ZP, 2017, CHIN J OCEANOL LIMN, V35, P163, DOI 10.1007/s00343-016-5241-",31,1,1,5,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Methods 104 nursing interns who were employed in the orthopedics department of our hospital from March 2018 to March 2020 were selected and randomly divided into traditional teaching (TT) group (n = 52) and joint teaching (JT) group (n = 52). Among them, the traditional teaching mode was adopted in the TT group, while the scenario simulation teaching method combined with progressive teaching mode was adopted in the JT group. The theoretical examination results, performance assessment results, comprehensive assessment results, the scores of nurse-patient communication skills, the CTDI-CV (Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory-Chinese Version) scores and the teaching satisfaction in the two groups of nursing interns were compared and analyzed. Results The theoretical examination results, performance assessment results and comprehensive assessment results in the JT group were significantly better than those in the TT group, with statistical differences (P < 0.05, t = 12.91, t = 11.65, t = 9.92). The scores of nurse-patient communication skills and the CTDI-CV scores in the JT group were significantly better than those in the TT group, with statistical differences (P < 0.05, t = 22.18, t = 16.88). Teaching satisfaction of 94.23% in the JT group was significantly higher than 73.08% in the TT group, with statistical differences (P < 0.05, chi(2) = 11.6050). Conclusion The application of scenario simulation teaching method combined with progressive teaching mode in clinical teaching of orthopedic nursing can effectively consolidate nursing interns' understanding of theoretical knowledge and significantly improve the proficiency in operating skills, the nurse-patient communication skills, the critical thinking ability in judging patients' conditions and nursing measures, as well as the nursing interns' teaching satisfaction of nursing, which is of positive significance to improve nursing interns' nursing quality.","[Liu, Bo] Univ South China, Dept Hand & Micro Surg, Affiliated Hosp, Hengyang, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Changhui] Univ South China, Dept Traumat Orthoped, Affiliated Hosp, Hengyang 421001, Hunan, Peoples R China","Xiao, CH (corresponding author), Univ South China, Dept Traumat Orthoped, Affiliated Hosp, Hengyang 421001, Hunan, Peoples R China.",1838363801@qq.com,,,,,"Bachiller C, 2003, IEEE ANTENN PROPAG M, V45, P140, DOI 10.1109/MAP.2003.118966; Caixia C., 2019, J MATH MED, V8, P25; Campbell E., 2019, PAIN MANAG NURS, V21, P36; Chun-Ming Y., 2019, TODAY NURSE, V10, P8; Cui X., 2020, ASIAN J SURG, V10, P2; Costa RRD, 2020, REV LAT-AM ENFERM, V28, DOI 10.1590/1518-8345.3147.330; Jianying Z., 2018, CHINA CONTINUING MED, V11, P32; Kai Y., 2019, CHIN MED MODERN DIST, V12, P32; Klenke-Borgmann L, 2019, NURS EDUC PERSPECT, V40, P; Leong CSUand., 2020, INT J TEACH ED, V8, P16; Lian LI., 2019, ED MODERNIZAT, V8, P19; Lightsey HM., 2018, ORTHOP J SPORTS MED, V6, P13; Naggar MAE., 2020, J PAKISTAN MED ASS, V70, P; Qiu-Hua S., 2019, CHIN J NURS ED, V9, P19; Rifaat AA, 2020, IDEAS J ENGL LANG TE, V8, P3; Rong LI., 2019, SMART HEALTHCARE, V9, P32; Samosorn AB, 2020, CLIN SIMUL NURS, V39, P18, DOI 10.1016/j.ecns.2019.10.00; Spiegel DA, 2015, WORLD J SURG, V39, P1421, DOI 10.1007/s00268-015-2971-; Tong Z., 2019, J MATH MED, V9, P20; Weston J., 2020, NURSE ED, V46, P7; Xiao-Ying Z., 2019, MED INFORM, V9, P16; Yang Y, 2020, SCI CHINA PHYS MECH, V63, DOI 10.1007/s11433-018-9407-; Ying Q., 2019, SMART HEALTHCARE, V9, P12; Zhen J., 2019, WORLD LATEST MED INF, V8, P12",24,0,0,7,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

It generates sub synchronous resonance (SSR) at turbine-generator shaft due to the interaction between the series compensation and wind turbine system. To solve this, several methods have been presented. However, these provide less performance during contingency period. Therefore, to mitigate the SSR and also to improve the dynamic performance of hybrid wind and PV system connected with series compensated wind farms, the adaptive technique of the Black Widow Optimization algorithm based Fuzzy Logic Controller (BWO-FLC) with UPFC is proposed in this paper. Here, the objective function is solved optimally using BWO technique. Based on this, the Fuzzy Logic Controller is designed. The results proved that the proposed controller performs the mitigation of SSR. The damping ratios of proposed controller to mitigation of SSR are 0.0098, 0.0139, and 0.0195 for wind speed of 6, 8 and 10 m/s respectively.","[Arockiaraj, S.; Manikandan, B., V] Mepco Schlenk Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Sivakasi 626005, Tamil Nadu, India","Arockiaraj, S (corresponding author), Mepco Schlenk Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Sivakasi 626005, Tamil Nadu, India.",arockiaraj.s@mepcoeng.ac.in,"B.V., MANIKANDAN/T-4927-2019; Mahamane, Ali/AAY-1563-2021; S, Arockiaraj/T-4563-2019","S, Arockiaraj/0000-0001-9878-0364",,,"AlKaabi SS, 2015, IEEE T SUSTAIN ENERG, V6, P1224, DOI 10.1109/TSTE.2015.242230; Alomari MM, 2011, COMMUN NONLINEAR SCI, V16, P2363, DOI 10.1016/j.cnsns.2010.04.04; [Anonymous], 2003, MODERN POWER SYSTE; Arockiaraj S, 2018, COMM COM INF SC, V844, P242, DOI 10.1007/978-981-13-0716-4_2; El-Moursi MS, 2010, IEEE T POWER ELECTR, V25, P429, DOI 10.1109/TPEL.2009.202665; Leon AE, 2013, IET GENER TRANSM DIS, V7, P511, DOI 10.1049/iet-gtd.2012.035; Hayyolalam V, 2020, ENG APPL ARTIF INTEL, V87, DOI 10.1016/j.engappai.2019.10324; Jiang HL, 2019, J ENG-JOE, P2505, DOI 10.1049/joe.2018.853; Kawabe K, 2017, IEEE T POWER SYST, V32, P1796, DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2016.259297; Khazaie J, 2012, INT J ELEC POWER, V43, P80, DOI 10.1016/j.ijepes.2012.05.00; Ko HS, 2008, ELECTR POW SYST RES, V78, P1841, DOI 10.1016/j.epsr.2008.02.01; Leon AE, 2015, IEEE T POWER SYST, V30, P419, DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2014.232719; Li H, 2019, IEEE ACCESS, V7, P61512, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.291554; Li PH, 2019, INT J ELEC POWER, V107, P239, DOI 10.1016/j.ijepes.2018.11.02; Liu HK, 2018, IEEE T POWER SYST, V33, P3118, DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2017.276415; Moghe R, 2017, IEEE T IND APPL, V53, P1372, DOI 10.1109/TIA.2016.263452; Mohammadpour HA, 2016, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V31, P76, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2015.246432; Mohammadpour HA, 2015, ELECTR POW SYST RES, V123, P57, DOI 10.1016/j.epsr.2015.01.01; Mohammadpour HA, 2015, IEEE T SUSTAIN ENERG, V6, P388, DOI 10.1109/TSTE.2014.238078; Panda S, 2016, MECH SYST SIGNAL PR, V68-69, P523, DOI 10.1016/j.ymssp.2015.07.01; Rafi FHM, 2017, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V32, P2291, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2016.260222; Raju DK, 2017, MECH SYST SIGNAL PR, V85, P698, DOI 10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.09.01; Shah R, 2015, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V41, P1423, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2014.09.02; Sivakumar TA, 2020, MICROPROCESS MICROSY, V74, DOI 10.1016/j.micpro.2020.10301; Sridhar V, 2017, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V78, P138, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2017.04.11; Varma RK, 2008, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V23, P1645, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2008.91769; Varma RK, 2017, IEEE T SUSTAIN ENERG, V8, P1473, DOI 10.1109/TSTE.2017.269127",27,0,0,2,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

When attempting to take an exit, a driver's line of sight may be obscured by the curvature or slope of the main expressway, roadside vegetation, traffic signs, and other vehicles traveling alongside. These increase the likelihood of accidents due to inaccurate or poor driver judgement when approaching a highway exit. Because of emotional responses that accompany the possibility of missing an exit, many drivers act irrationally through haphazard acceleration or braking, aggressive lane changes; in some cases, even coming to a complete stop and reversing against the flow of high speed traffic to correct their course. This study applies to curved highway exit corridors with a poor line of sight. The total visible area of the exit ramp is defined in accordance with the design specifications of both the highway routes and exit ramps, which was then further refined by considering the driving characteristics of both the drivers and of surrounding traffic. This study set out to establish a reliable occlusion model of highway exits with the following goals in mind. Geometric equations describing the area and volume of the target area of the exit ramp are established. Discrete expression equation was deployed to establish the occlusion model for the target area within the visual field. Parameters taken from specifications of the Hunan section of the Shanghai-Kunming Expressway are used for multiple calculations, in which obstruction patterns of objects with the same width, and objects with different width at different positions are analyzed. Based on the patterns observed from stimulated experiments mentioned above, multiple effective measures were proposed to prevent the obstruction of the highway exit ramp. In summary, this study provides theoretical support for prevention of obstruction as well as an anti-occlusion model for better identification of the highway exit ramps by intelligent vehicle systems.","[Xiao, Jian; Huang, Zhongxiang] Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Traff & Transportat Engn, Changsha 410114, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Jian] Guangxi Univ, Sch Resource Environm & Mat, Nanning, Peoples R China; [Li, Yu; Yang, Liulin] Guangxi Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Nanning, Peoples R China; [He, Juanxia; Yang, Jian] Guangxi Polytech Construct, Nanning, Peoples R China","Huang, ZX (corresponding author), Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Traff & Transportat Engn, Changsha 410114, Hunan, Peoples R China.",447442396@qq.com,,,,,"Alves LF, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P62, DOI 10.1177/002072091878745; [Anonymous], 2017, JTGD202017 MIN TRAN; [Anonymous], 2014, JTGTD21201; Bao B, 2011, HIGHWAY, V56, P13; Hassan Y, 2001, J TRANSP ENG, V127, P295, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2001)127:4(295; Liang Y., 2014, IEEE T KNOWL DATA EN, V28, P50; Lin X, 2016, STUDY OPTIMIZATION ; Liu X., 2012, HIGHWAY, V57, P5; Pan B., 2016, HIGHWAY ENG, V42, P3; Qadeer RA, 2018, INT J ADOLESC YOUTH, V23, P99, DOI 10.1080/02673843.2017.129724; Qi LH, 2018, COMPOS SCI TECHNOL, V159, P142, DOI 10.1016/j.compscitech.2018.02.02; Shen Q., 2015, J SAF ENV, V14, P8; Shen Q., 2012, CHINESE FOREIGN HIGH, V37, P30; Tian Z., 2013, ROAD STEAM TRANSP, V29, P8; Wang JL, 2017, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V9, DOI 10.3390/su906089; Wu Y., 2014, ROAD STEAM TRANSP, V30, P10; Yan G, 2018, SHANGHAI CONSTRUCT S, V39, P6; Yin H S, 2017, ENG CONSTRUCT, V31, P8; Zeng SZ, 2018, TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO, V24, P969, DOI 10.3846/20294913.2016.121647",19,0,0,3,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Nonlinear numerical simulation is proposed as a new method to analyze noise recently. The Non-Linear Acoustic Solver (NLAS) is employed to study the cavity noise in supersonic combined with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation. It is shown by the comparison between the calculated results and the WICS wind tunnel tests when the Mach number is 2, the sound pressure level of every monitoring point is in good agreement with experiments. It indicates that the NLAS method which is based on turbulence reconstruction could well simulate the cavity noise in supersonic and reduce mesh numbers. Based on this, the contribution to aerodynamic noise suppression made by active control measure such as adding jet screen at the leading edge of cavity is investigated. It is found that jet screen improves flow condition and increases cavity safety, therefore, it is suitable for suppression of aerodynamic noise under supersonic condition.","[Chen, Binqi] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Aeronaut & Astronaut, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yiding] Sichuan Tengden Technol Co Ltd, Chengdu, Peoples R China","Wang, YD (corresponding author), Sichuan Tengden Technol Co Ltd, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",wyding127@163.com,,"Wang, Yiding/0000-0001-7393-980X",,,"Alvi FS., 2000, FLUIDS 2000 C EXH D; Barter JW., 1995, THESIS U TEXAS AUST; Batten P, 2004, AIAA J, V42, P485, DOI 10.2514/1.349; Batten P., 2002, 8 AIAA CEAS AER C E; Bower W., 2004, 2 AIAA FLOW CONTR ; Casella M., 2004, 10 AIAA CEAS AER C ; Chen BQ, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072092094057; Chen BQ, 2019, INT J AEROSPACE ENG, V2019, DOI 10.1155/2019/415328; Liu Q, 2019, AIAA J, V57, P876, DOI 10.2514/1.J05697; Liu Y, 2015, INT J AERONAUT SPACE, V16, P19, DOI 10.5139/IJASS.2015.16.1.1; Miehael JA., 2000, 6 AER C EXH LAH HI ; Murray NE., 2006, P 12 AIAA CEAS AER ; Perng SW., 1996, THESIS U TEXAS AUST; Seo JH, 2007, J SOUND VIB, V306, P564, DOI 10.1016/j.jsv.2007.05.04; SHAW L, 1988, J AIRCRAFT, V25, P147, DOI 10.2514/3.4555; Shaw L., 1998, 4 AIAA CEAS AER C T; Smith BR., 2002, 40 AIAA AER SCI M E; Spalart PR, 2009, ANNU REV FLUID MECH, V41, P181, DOI 10.1146/annurev.fluid.010908.16513; Spalart PR., 1997, ADV DNS LES P 1 AFO; Tam CKW, 2004, INT J COMPUT FLUID D, V18, P547, DOI 10.1080/1061856041000167355; Terracol M., 2008, 14 AIAA CEAS AER C ; Wang XS, 2020, AIAA J, V58, P2070, DOI 10.2514/1.J05901",22,1,1,5,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Creating a sports management system for basketball teams will thus have a great impact to the approximately 2.2 billion people using the online platforms. Since marketing is important in almost every field, we will be employing it in school sports. School sports assume a significant role in mental and physiological well-being, particularly in the information age. Its emergence has incredibly helped in the upkeep of a healthy well being and an exponential decrease in non-communicable diseases and chronic illnesses. As one of the sports being played in college institutions, Basketball is fundamental in maintaining an optimal body mass index (BMI) and reducing obesity. It should thus be encouraged. This study's objective is to oversee the creation of a sports marketing management system (SMMS) for college basketball teams. We explain the procedural processes involved in building the management system. This is because its mere presence and practice are not sufficient to oversee its full potential, marketing is at the core of every successful implementation and it is thus necessary to create this system for this sole purpose. Creating this system, especially in this data age is so important since there are a barrage of platforms to facilitate its use. A previous study has indicated a rise in the utilization of technological gadgets, such as PCs, cell phones, and work stations. Figure 1 indicates these findings. Making a management system that may be utilized with these gadgets will subsequently help access to numerous understudies. It will likewise assist in reaching a large circle of target audience. This is because participants will be not only able to participate on-site but also off-site. This investigation discretely explains the requirement for the SMMS.

Thus, the present study investigated the effect of innovative pedagogy integration in electrical installation and maintenance works in technical colleges in Enugu and Lagos states of Nigeria. The study adopted a school-based randomised Solomon Four-Group Design involving a treatment group versus the control group. We selected three hundred and fifteen (315) technical college year two (TC II) electrical installation and maintenance work students who met the study's inclusion criteria from the technical colleges in Enugu and Lagos state of Nigeria. The intervention consisted of eight weeks of innovative pedagogy treatment. Electrical installation and Maintenance Achievement Test (EMAT) were used for data collection. We used analysis of variance, t-test for independent samples, and Chi-Squared for data analysis. The outcome indicated that innovative pedagogy improved students' learning outcomes and significantly affected students' EMAT achievement among electrical installation and maintenance work students in the treatment group compared to their control group counterparts. The study showed, no significant main difference across all the control variables. Finally, there is no interaction effect of pre-test and treatment conditions. Thus, the current study suggests that technical college teachers should adopt innovative teaching approaches to improve students' learning outcomes, mainly because access to teaching and learning resources is limited.","[Olelewe, Chijioke J.] Univ Nigeria, Dept Comp & Robot Educ, Nsukka, Nigeria; [Doherty, Funmilayo, V; Aneyo, Idowu] Yaba Coll Technol, Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Lagos, Nigeria; [Orji, Chibueze T.] Univ Nigeria, Dept Ind Tech Educ, Nsukka, Nigeria","Orji, CT (corresponding author), Univ Nigeria, Dept Ind Tech Educ, Fac Vocat & Tech Educ, Nsukka, Nigeria.",tobias.orji@unn.edu.ng,,"Orji, Chibueze Tobias/0000-0002-3457-6206; Doherty, Funmilayo/0000-0002-7689-8764",Ford Foundation,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The researchers are grateful to Ford Foundation for funding the research that gave birth to this study.","Abdulbaki K., 2018, INT J HIGH ED, V7, P118, DOI DOI 10.5430/IJHE.V7N6P11; Akinbobola AO, 2015, ADV PHYS THEOR APPL, V41, P2; Anastas JW., 2010, TEACHING SOCIAL WOR; [Anonymous], 2013, FEDERAL REPUBLIC NIG, V6th e; Azer SA, 2005, J ROY SOC MED, V98, P67, DOI 10.1258/jrsm.98.2.6; Bakare J, 2019, EDUC INF TECHNOL, V24, P1035, DOI 10.1007/s10639-018-9808-; Beasley C., 1997, LEARN TEACH, V7, P2; Biemans H., 2004, J VOCAT EDUC TRAIN, V56, P52; BUTLER JA, 1992, MED TEACH, V14, P11, DOI 10.3109/0142159920904401; Carrier K., 2005, MIDDLE SCH J, V37, P1; Cashin WE., 2011, EFFECTIVE CLASSROO; de Bruijn E, 2011, TEACH TEACH EDUC, V27, P694, DOI 10.1016/j.tate.2010.11.00; Demirel M, 2010, HACET U EGITIM FAK, P5; Dodewar AG., 2012, CONFLUENCE 24 25 FE; Ezeugwu EN., 2009, THESIS ENUGU STATE ; Faraday S., ECER 201; Folashade A., 2009, EUR J PHYS, V1, P4; Fraenkel JR., 1993, DESIGN EVALUATE RE; Giridharan K, 2016, INT J EDUC SCI, V14, P174, DOI 10.1080/09751122.2016.1189049; Hartl M., 2011, TECHNICAL VOCATIONAL, P; Hattie J., 2015, SCHOLARSHIP TEACHING, V1, P79, DOI DOI 10.1037/STL000002; Helmstadter GC., 1970, RES CONCEPTS HUMAN ; Hsieh SW, 2011, EDUC TECHNOL SOC, V14, P16; Hung CM, 2014, J COMPUT EDUC, V1, P151, DOI 10.1007/s40692-014-0008-; Ipek H., 2008, INT J ENV SCI ED, V3, P14; Jain DK., 2012, IEEE STUD C EL EL CO, P; Khaled A, 2014, J VOCAT EDUC TRAIN, V66, P462, DOI 10.1080/13636820.2014.91769; Llevot-Calvet N, 2018, NEW PEDAGOGICAL CHAL, P; Marzano R.J, 1998, THEORY BASED METAAN; Matsuda N, 2010, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V6094, P31; National Board for Technical Education, 2003, EL INST MAINT WORK ; Nazzal A., 2002, ACTION TEACH EDUC, V24, P6; Neo M., 2001, J ED TECHNOLOGY SOC, V4, P1; Ngubane-Mokiwa SA., 2013, THESIS U S AFRICA A; Nwachukwu CE., 2006, DESIGNING APPROPRIA; Obi CA., 2005, METHODOLOGY BUSINES; Ogwo BA., 2006, METHODOLOGY FORMAL ; Olelewe CJ, 2016, COMPUT EDUC, V103, P76, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2016.09.01; Orji CT, 2022, INNOV EDUC TEACH INT, V59, P326, DOI 10.1080/14703297.2020.181318; Orji CT, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P334, DOI 10.1177/002072091877398; Orji CT., 2015, THESIS U NIGERIA NI; Papanna KM, 2013, AFR HEALTH SCI, V13, P808, DOI 10.4314/ahs.v13i3.4; Perkins DV, 2001, TEACH PSYCHOL, V28, P111, DOI 10.1207/S15328023TOP2802_0; Prpic JK., 2009, WHAT IS PROBLEM BAS; Raelin JA, 1997, ORGAN SCI, V8, P563, DOI 10.1287/orsc.8.6.56; Ratanarajah JAP, 2020, AIP CONF PROC, V2266, DOI 10.1063/5.001815; Rohrbeck CA, 2003, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V95, P240, DOI 10.1037/0022-0663.95.2.24; Sachou M-E., 2013, FUTURE E; Sahin M, 2009, SCI RES ESSAYS, V4, P75; Santos J, 2019, NURS EDUC TODAY, V72, P12, DOI 10.1016/j.nedt.2018.10.00; SOLOMON RL, 1949, PSYCHOL BULL, V46, P137, DOI 10.1037/h006295; STEM Learning, 2004, PED PRACT TEACH LEA; Suseendran G., 2017, INT J INNOVATIVE RES, V1, P10; Traub RE., 1994, RELIABILITY SOCIAL S, V; Union A, 2007, M BUR C MIN ED AFR U, P2; van den Berg N., 2008, GLAS VULT ZICH KENN; Yao YY, 2015, J AM SOC MASS SPECTR, V26, P98, DOI 10.1007/s13361-014-1008-; Yoder JD, 2005, TEACH PSYCHOL, V32, P91, DOI 10.1207/s15328023top3202_; Yusra LV, 2002, ACAD MED, V72, P38; Zhang J-P., 1996, ELECTROCHIM ACTA, V",60,2,2,2,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Meanwhile, the application of lightweight network to pattern recognition has become a trend with the development of mobile networks. In order to improve the recognition accuracy of the lightweight network model MobileNetV2 and reduce the computational cost and delay caused by extracting rich features, an improved lightweight network model based on MobileNetV2 is proposed, in which an improved reverse residual module (C-Inverted residual block) is applied to replace the traditional module. In the improved reverse residual module, channel split operation is added to reduce MAC, and channel shuffle operations are used to promote information exchange and channel fusion. Experiments were carried out on Pascal VOC 2007 detection data set to test the general performance of the proposed improved model. Under the operation limits of 140 MFLOPS, 40 MFLOPS and 20 MFLOPS, mean average precision (mAP) of the improved MobileNetV2 algorithm increased by 1.2%, 2.2% and 4.3% compared with MobileNetV2. While the recognition accuracy of the proposed network model on self-made dataset of student classroom behavior states is 4.6% and 3.7% higher than that of MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2 respectively, and the average recognition rate of students' classroom behavior states can be up to 92.7%. The results of this research combined with mobile networks would be expected to be used to evaluate teaching and learning effects and promote teaching quality improvement.","[Cao, Dan; Liu, Jianfei; Wang, Chen] Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Tianjin 300401, Peoples R China; [Hao, Luguo] Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Informat Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Wenbin] Guangzhou Hison Comp Technol Co Ltd, R&D Dept, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Yang, Wenrong] Hebei Univ Technol, State Key Lab Reliabil & Intelligence Elect Equip, Tianjin, Peoples R China","Liu, JF (corresponding author), Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Tianjin 300401, Peoples R China.",jfliu@hebut.edu.cn,,,"Research and practice of higher education teaching reform of Hebei Province, China [2018GJJG060]; Postgraduate demonstration course project of Hebei Province, China [KCJSX2020014]; Guangzhou Science and Technology plan project [201802020008]; Key Project of Science and Technology Research of Hebei Higher Education, China [ZD2017021]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This paper is supported by Research and practice of higher education teaching reform of Hebei Province, China (Grant no: 2018GJJG060), Postgraduate demonstration course project of Hebei Province, China (Grant no: KCJSX2020014), Guangzhou Science and Technology plan project(Grant no: 201802020008) and Key Project of Science and Technology Research of Hebei Higher Education, China (Grant no: ZD2017021).","Ashwin TS, 2020, EDUC INF TECHNOL, V25, P1387, DOI 10.1007/s10639-019-10004-; Bangqi L., 2019, INT J AUDIO VISUAL E, V40, P8; Bo Wen, 2020, Innovative Computing.

In SDN, different applications require the controller to deploy corresponding flow entries to maintain the effectiveness of network. However, the matching field range covered by entries of different applications may overlap, and when actions specified by these overlapping entries are inconsistent, conflicts may occur. Such conflicts may cause the flow to match the wrong entry, thereby affecting the correct expression of application functions. The scheme we proposed in this paper will be able to detect and resolve conflicts between flow entries. Firstly, we discussed the causes of conflicts, and then classified various conflict situations. This classification will help us to adopt different ways of resolving different types of conflicts and make the resolution of conflicts more targeted. Next, we propose a conflict detection algorithm based on B+ tree. This algorithm can detect different types of conflicts. According to theoretical proof, the use of B+ tree compared with other similar structures better in the performance of the time and space complexity. Finally, for the detected conflicting entries, we propose a conflict resolution scheme based on the failure degree of the flow entry according to the characteristics of SDN services tending to be more detailed. Through experimental evaluation, our scheme can effectively detect and resolve conflicts with lower overhead.","[Tang, Lie; Fu, You; Zeng, Youwen; Li, Zhihao; Li, Shuangqing] Chongqing Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chongqing, Peoples R China","Tang, L (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",mercury@cqu.edu.cn,,,,,"[Anonymous], 2014, P ACM 3 WORKSH HOT ; Diouf S, 2020, INT CONF ADV COMMUN, P566, DOI 10.23919/ICACT48636.2020.906145; Farhadi H, 2014, INT CONF CLOUD ENG, P598, DOI 10.1109/IC2E.2014.2; Khurshid A, 2012, ACM SIGCOMM COMP COM, V42, P467, DOI 10.1145/2377677.237776; Kreutz D, 2015, P IEEE, V103, P14, DOI 10.1109/JPROC.2014.237199; Laghari AA, 2019, SYST PRACT ACT RES, V32, P501, DOI 10.1007/s11213-018-9471-; McKeown N, 2008, ACM SIGCOMM COMP COM, V38, P69, DOI 10.1145/1355734.135574; Mogul Jeffrey C, 2013, P 12 ACM WORKSH HOT, DOI DOI 10.1145/253577; Natarajan S., 2012, 2012 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC), P690, DOI 10.1109/ICCNC.2012.616751; Pisharody S, 2019, IEEE T DEPEND SECURE, V16, P1011, DOI 10.1109/TDSC.2017.272606; Pisharody S, 2016, IEEE CONF COMM NETW, P19, DOI 10.1109/CNS.2016.786046; Scher AD, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P367, DOI 10.1177/002072091877504; Schwabe A, 2016, PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM, IRTF & ISOC APPLIED NETWORKING RESEARCH WORKSHOP (ANRW'16), P26, DOI 10.1145/2959424.295943; Son S, 2013, IEEE IC; Varghese G., 2004, MORGAN KAUFMANN SER; Wang SY, 2016, PROCEEDINGS 2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORKING AND NETWORK APPLICATIONS NANA 2016, P299, DOI 10.1109/NaNA.2016.4; Yang T., 2012, IC NETWORK PROTOCO; Yao SB, 1978, P 1978 ACM SIGMOD IN, P6; Zhu DH, 2019, INT CONF COMP SCI ED, P731, DOI 10.1109/ICCSE.2019.884544",19,0,0,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The main aspects of learning linguistics. From the perspective of film culture, it is necessary to reduce the Chinese and English value of English film education. Among these representative forces, film culture is mainly concentrated in the core of Chinese and English. On the radio, British film culture became English. The field of knowledge teaching is much larger. Based on the positive and positive English movies, this paper adopts the teaching method of Chinese and English double subtitle music to capture the words and sentences in the film, and uses the combination of image and sound to improve the perception of English. The difference between Chinese application and English application lies in the embodiment of traditional thinking mode in different countries. It is proved by experiments that there are great differences in application value. However, due to the iconicity and randomness of language symbols, the application of Chinese has some value in English. Students who adopt English film teaching method have advantages in shaping values and accepting foreign values. With the passage of time, the application of English film teaching will continue to deepen.","[Zheng, Ping; Jiang, Jingjing; Jiang, Tingting] Weifang Engn Vocat Coll, Weifang 262500, Shandong, Peoples R China","Zheng, P (corresponding author), Weifang Engn Vocat Coll, Weifang 262500, Shandong, Peoples R China.",zhengping1967@126.com,,,,,"Enhui Y., 2019, J W ANHUI U, V2019, P14; Hong W., 2019, FUJIAN FILM YE, V41, P23; Jiangyun H, 2014, CHINA TODAY, V2014, P5; Jianjun D, 2010, TEACHER, V2010, P12; Jie C, 2017, FUJIAN TEA, V39, P15; Jin G, 2018, ED PRACT RES MIDDLE, V467, P2; Linlin S, 2013, SILK ROAD, V2013, P5; Mingxia H., 2007, FILM LIT, V445, P10; NGUYEN HV, 1992, PHYS REV LETT, V68, P994, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.68.99; Cid GP, 2019, J PUBLIC AFF EDUC, V25, P495, DOI 10.1080/15236803.2018.148909; Rui L., 2011, FILM LIT, V535, P9; Shimei B., 2014, J CHANGJIANG U SOC S, V37, P10; Xiang Y, 2019, INT J GREENH GAS CON, V82, P127, DOI 10.1016/j.ijggc.2019.01.00; Xiaohua H., 2019, FAMOUS TEACH ONLINE, V78, P6; Yang L, 2019, WAY SUCCESS, V593, P1",15,0,0,13,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

It must create enough interest in the students, especially, when it is in the online mode. In this paper, a novel pedagogy has been proposed, which can work for both online and offline classes based on the social constructivist methods. The methods followed in the proposed pedagogy are classified into two types, viz. social examples and technical drama. One of the courses of first-year engineering undergraduates, Basic Electrical Engineering (BEE), has been taken into consideration for the practical implementation of this pedagogy. A detailed explanation of the above mentioned two methods has been presented in this paper as teaching experiments (TE), with the support of different topics of the course considered. The teachers of the courses such as BEE can follow the methods described in this paper to facilitate active learning, leading to a good understanding of the concepts. The methods have been designed such as to make both teachers and students active participants in the process of teaching and learning in both online and offline classrooms. Students are well satisfied with this novel pedagogy and it is reflected in their feedback on teacher practices as well as in their performance in the semester examinations.","[Allamsetty, Srikanth; Panigrahi, Chinmoy Kumar] KIIT Deemed Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India; [Chandra, M.

Globally, under the influence of the COVID-19, the interdisciplinary research between the two disciplines has once again attracted attention. From the perspective of public health, the origin of the relationship between the disease and urban design was traced, and the urban epidemic prevention in the isolation-quarantine-epidemic prevention-traceability epidemic was discovered response to the changing process. In response to frequent epidemics, it is proposed that urban design needs to return to a healthy city model oriented by public health and public health needs.

The design of the system includes light energy estimation, attitude mode design, elevation angle analysis and flash time design. It is a 100 kg satellite with two LED arrays on 547 km. When it flashes, the satellite points to the observation location. The LED rays flash as the rule of Morse code. The satellite was sent to the orbit in Dec 2018 and the test of flash was completed within one month after then. The photo taken by star sensor can compare the apparent magnitude by the gray level. The results of the analysis show that the satellite can achieve 0 apparent magnitude, which is consistent with the design of the system. As a meaningful scientific experiment, Ladybeetle-1 links space technology with popular science education and also provides a reference for space applications.","[Mu, Xia; Li, Sihai] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Automat, Xian 710129, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhenxing] Beijing Commsat Technol Dev Co Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xi, Bin; Xiao, Mingguo] TY Space Technol Beijing Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China","Mu, X (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Automat, Xian 710129, Peoples R China.",muxia_l@mail.nwpu.edu.cn,,,"Beijing Commsat Technology Development Co., Ltd","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors received financial support from Beijing Commsat Technology Development Co., Ltd for the research and authorship.","Abdelaziz AY., 2018, CLASSICAL RECENT ASP, DOI DOI 10.1016/B978-0-12-812441-3.00016-; Agrawal DC, 2016, EUR J PHYS, V37, DOI 10.1088/0143-0807/37/3/03560; Lu H, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091988380; Markley F.L, 2014, FUNDAMENTALS SPACECR, DOI [10.1007/978-1-4939-0802-8, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-0802-8; Mu XG, 2021, ENVIRON TECHNOL, V42, P2709, DOI 10.1080/09593330.2019.171057; Rhodes Christopher J, 2010, Sci Prog, V93, P3; Wu JP, 2015, INT CONF SOFTW ENG, P1, DOI 10.1109/ICSESS.2015.733899",7,0,0,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Although there are many researches on LBC, there are few researches on LBC's physical and mental health(PMH).In this regard, this paper studies whether physical education and exercise are very important for improving PMH in LBC, and collects and classifies data on PMH in LBC by referring to the literature. Interviews are used to collect the true thoughts of LBC and to understand PMH. The questionnaire survey was used to investigate the PMH status of LBC, and objectively and comprehensively collected the PMH status data of LBC. Finally, the data obtained are statistically analyzed by the method of several examples. This paper studies the situation of LBC participating in extracurricular sports activities and makes a comparison with non-LBC. The results show that the LBC who take part in more after-school sports training have better PMH, more cheerful personality, more love and compassion, can quickly adapt to a new environment, and are emotionally stable. They can handle things calmly and develop their individual emotions well. In addition, the probability of PMH problems of non-LBC is smaller than that of LBC. Through the research and analysis of sports and PMH of LBC, it is found that sports play a positive role in promoting the PMH of LBC. Therefore, physical education is of great value to promote the healthy development of LBC.","[Peng, Chenggen] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Sport, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jie] Changsha Normal Univ, Coll Sport Sci, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Li, Moutao] Huangshan Coll, Coll Phys Educ, Huangshan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xin] Guizhou Educ Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Guiyang 550000, Guizhou, Peoples R China","Zhang, X (corresponding author), Guizhou Educ Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Guiyang 550000, Guizhou, Peoples R China.",3505999604@qq.com,,,National Social Science Fund of China [18BTY102],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (No. 18BTY102): An Empirical Study of Sports Participation in Promoting Social Adaptation of Left-behind Children in Rural Areas from the Perspective of Health Dividend.","Adams John, 2016, Nurs Stand, V30, P31, DOI 10.7748/ns.30.30.31.s4; Allen B, 2015, J CHILD FAM STUD, V24, P386, DOI 10.1007/s10826-013-9848-; Cardina C, 2018, J PHYS EDUC RECREAT, V89, P9, DOI 10.1080/07303084.2018.151645; da Costa LA, 2016, SPORT ETHICS PHILOS, V10, P444, DOI 10.1080/17511321.2016.121020; Dalgaty F, 2017, CLIN TEACH, V14, P124, DOI 10.1111/tct.1251; Donyai P, 2016, INT J PHARM PRACT, V24, P227, DOI 10.1111/ijpp.1228; Dudley D, 2018, J PHYS EDUC RECREAT, V89, P7, DOI 10.1080/07303084.2018.141899; Eassa AM, 2018, PROGRAM COMPUT SOFT+, V44, P435, DOI 10.1134/S036176881901002; Feller MB, 2018, NEURON, V99, P1113, DOI 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.09.00; Gillespie C, 2016, ACAD MED, V91, P690, DOI 10.1097/ACM.000000000000092; Hastie P, 2016, J PHILOS SPORT, V43, P327, DOI 10.1080/00948705.2016.116562; Johnson TG, 2016, J PHYS EDUC RECREAT, V87, P8, DOI 10.1080/07303084.2016.114219; Kalz M, 2017, J COMPUT HIGH EDUC, V29, P1, DOI 10.1007/s12528-017-9143-; Kara H, 2016, J PUBLIC MENT HEALTH, V15, P83, DOI 10.1108/JPMH-09-2015-004; Kim S, 2019, CLIN EXP HYPERTENS, V41, P766, DOI 10.1080/10641963.2018.155767; Kraemer HC, 2016, MED DECIS MAKING, V36, P5, DOI 10.1177/0272989X1560398; Li HF, 2017, ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM, V179, P; Maitlis S, 2017, J POSIT PSYCHOL, V12, P319, DOI 10.1080/17439760.2016.126261; Morley L, 2017, J MED IMAGING RADIAT, V48, P207, DOI 10.1016/j.jmir.2017.02.07; Morton PG, 2018, J PROF NURS, V34, P327, DOI 10.1016/j.profnurs.2018.08.00; Sofer D, 2018, AM J NURS, V118, P17, DOI 10.1097/01.NAJ.0000532063.79102.1; Stolz SA, 2014, ROUT STUD PHYS EDU, P; Sutton H., 2018, DEAN PROVOST, V19, P; Todres J, 2018, FAM COURT REV, V56, P33; Waddell LF, 2017, AM J PREV MED, V52, pS216, DOI 10.1016/j.amepre.2016.11.01; Zhang CC, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091986041",26,0,0,7,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Education informatization has gradually become one of the core factors that determine the quality of education. There is a close connection with the regional economy. The western region of my country (mainly including the mountainous areas in the southwest and the arid areas in the northwest) shows regional characteristics such as fragile ecological environment, lagging economic development, and large gaps in infrastructure and public services. Informatization of education is urgently needed to promote regional economic development. By comparing the gross product and educational expenditure of Zhejiang province and Gansu Province, this paper concludes the interdependence and mutual promotion between the development of educational informationization and regional economic development. On this basis, this paper analyzes the necessity of the informationization of education and the coordinated development of regional economy in the ecologically fragile areas of western China. Finally, from five aspects, it puts forward an effective way to promote the development of education informatization and regional economy, aiming at realizing the coordinated development of education informatization and regional economy. Finally improve the social productivity of western region and our country's comprehensive national strength.","[Shi, Yin] Maanshan Teachers Coll, Dept Teacher Educ, Maanshan 243000, Peoples R China","Shi, Y (corresponding author), Maanshan Teachers Coll, Dept Teacher Educ, Maanshan 243000, Peoples R China.",10085@massz.edu.cn,,,,,"[Anonymous], 2020, CHINA SOIL WATER CON, V10, P7; Becker T, 2019, ROUTL CONTEMP RUSS E, P1; In-Yeup K., 2019, IND J PUBL HLTH RES, V6, P3; Jiqiong Y., P 2018 4 INT C ED MA, V18, P116; Le Z., 2017, P 2017 5 INT ED EC S, P2; Lijun D., 2018, J ADV ED RES, V3, P4; Lin L., 2020, J PHYS C SER, V157; Liu X., 2012, FUJIAN BASIC ED RES, V6, P2; Luo Y, 2019, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V696, DOI 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.13398; Riba JR, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V57, P230, DOI 10.1177/002072091880044; Song W., 2019, ED MODERN, V6, P11; Tian W., 2020, ABSTRACT EC MANAGE, V8, P; Wang AY, 2019, J VOCAT EDUC TRAIN, V71, P538, DOI 10.1080/13636820.2018.153551; Yamei M., 2017, P 2017 INT C FRONT E, P58; Yan SG, 2017, ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM, V120, P; Zhang X., 2014, 2014 IEEE INT C AC S, P215, DOI [DOI 10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6853589, 10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6853589",16,0,0,11,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

It needs to be provided on a regular basis and include the aspect of reflective practice to be really effective. The purpose of this article is to highlight the results of how an academic in Electrical Engineering effectively used Blackboard (TM) to foster student engagement and academic success through regular online self-assessments that require reflective practice. A time-lag study is used with a non-experimental descriptive design. A total of 812 first-year engineering students were asked to complete weekly online self-assessments via Blackboard (TM) between 2016 and 2018. Results indicate that students engaged at least three times more with each section of the course content and that their pass rate increased by more than 20% when compared to previous years where no online self-assessments were used. These results tend to suggest that online self-assessments should include multiple attempts with some form of feedback to foster student engagement and academic success.,"[Swart, Arthur J.] Cent Univ Technol, Dept Elect Elect & Comp Engn, Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Meda, Lawrence] Zayed Univ, Coll Educ, Educ Studies Dept, Dubai, U Arab Emirates","Meda, L (corresponding author), Zayed Univ, Coll Educ, Educ Studies Dept, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",Lawrence.Meda@zu.ac.ae,,"Meda, Lawrence/0000-0002-9496-9132",,,"Alvarez A, 2013, COMPUT EDUC, V68, P129, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2013.05.00; Arkorful V., 2015, INT J INSTR TECHNOL, V12, P29, DOI DOI 10.1016/J.PR0CS.2012.10.03; Chugh R, 2017, TURK ONLINE J DISTAN, V18, P; Cosgrave M., 2010, WEB TOOL USE GROUP ; Daniels P., 2009, INT J EMERG TECHNOL, V7, P9; Delderfield R, 2018, REFLECT PRACT, V5th e; Dewey J., 1933, WE THIN; Elakkiya E., 2017, INT J CURR MICROBIOL, V6, P1817, DOI DOI 10.20546/IJCMAS.2017.606.21; Fosso-Kankeu E., 2019, 17 INT C SCI ENG TE; Fung CY, 2019, E-J BUS EDUC SCHOLAR, V13, P3; Gibbs P, 2015, SLAVOJ ZIZEK, P3; Goddard W., 2006, RES METHODOLOGY INTR, V2nd e; Henderson S., 2013, REFLECTION ACTION GU, P5; Howard P, 2009, ASIA-PAC J COOP EDUC, V10, P17; Ibrahim M., 2014, EUR J BUSINESS MANAG, V6, P19; Lazarus Daudi, 2018, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, V175, DOI 10.1088/1755-1315/175/1/01222; Nurnberg T, 2016, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V53, P99, DOI 10.1177/002072091561143; Ouadoud M., 2018, INT J INFORM TECHNOL, V2, P25, DOI [10.1007/978-3-319-74500-8_67, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-74500-8_67; Schon D, 1983, REFLECTIVE PRACTITI; Sternberg RJ, 2001, EDUC PSYCHOL-US, V36, P227, DOI 10.1207/S15326985EP3604_; Swart AJ., 2015, USING WEB20 TECHNOL; Swart AJ, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P244, DOI 10.1177/002072091876705; Swart AJ, 2017, IEEE GLOB ENG EDUC C, P175, DOI 10.1109/EDUCON.2017.794284; Swart AJ, 2015, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V52, P142, DOI 10.1177/002072091557592; Swart AJ, 2010, IEEE T EDUC, V53, P257, DOI 10.1109/TE.2009.201422; Thorburn M, 2019, SPORT EDUC SOC, V24, P404, DOI 10.1080/13573322.2017.140153; Turnbull D., 2019, LEARNING MANAGEMENT, DOI [10.1007/978-3-319-60013-0_248-1, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-60013-0_248-1; Zhang DS, 2004, COMMUN ACM, V47, P75, DOI 10.1145/986213.98621; Zhang K, 2010, P E LEARN 2010 WORLD, P127",29,0,0,1,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In order to test our model, we conducted a survey on 394 subordinates and 102 team leaders from 5 companies in Pearl River Delta, China. It is found that servant leadership can reduce team egoism, team egoism will enhance group collective organizational deviance, and team egoism plays a mediating role in the relationship between servant leadership and group collective organizational deviance.

J,"Yan, S1;  Ao, JP",,,,"Yan, Song; Ao, Jinping",,,The application of sports skill transfer theory in aerobics teaching in the information age,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION,,,English,Article; Early Access,,,,,,Sports skill; transfer theory; aerobics; teaching; information age; curriculum,,"Aerobics has always been an imperative facet in school curricula, right from elementary to higher institutions of learning like colleges and universities. Its importance in physical and mental well-being cannot be overlooked, especially in this information age, where a sizeable subset of the population has adopted a sedentary lifestyle. Unwholesomeness is still evident notwithstanding its introduction and practice in most institutions. This is presumably due to the lack of a better way to utilize its full potential. This calls for better implementation, for which this paper is written. The object of this paper is to look into the application of sport skill transfer theory in teaching aerobics. Skill transfer is a method of propagating a skill from one docket to the other for the sole purpose of process improvement. Sport skill transfer is thus the process of adopting skills used in sports into the aerobics teaching curriculum. The transfer of these skills will transform the teaching curriculum and processes in the course of aerobics lessons. Some skills which the paper will be delving into are; the use of competition as a tool. Fair competition is always known to improve processes to a certain degree. Other than competition vs practice comparisons, the paper also looks into biofeedback for which it elaborates on the importance of employing electromyogram (EMG) in monitoring motor movements; bilateral skill transfer and the use of imagery are also elaborated. It further discusses the dynamics of aerobics and sports, drawing the similarities and differences of the duo and showing the application of the former's skills in teaching the later, especially in this information era.","[Yan, Song] Beijing Sport Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ao, Jinping] Cent China Normal Univ, Wuhan 430000, Peoples R China","Ao, JP (corresponding author), Cent China Normal Univ, Wuhan 430000, Peoples R China.",aomashiwan001@mail.ccnu.edu.cn,,,,,"Appleby BB, 2020, J STRENGTH COND RES, V34, P54, DOI 10.1519/JSC.000000000000303; Balk YA, 2020, APPL PSYCHOL-INT REV, V69, P120, DOI 10.1111/apps.1218; Bidad S., 2020, J NUTR FAST HLTH, V8, P12; Bonnette S, 2020, J SPORT SCI MED, V19, P8; Garten AS., 2019, U.S. patent application, Patent No. [16/144,854, 16144854; Gillen B, 2019, J POLIT ECON, V127, P1826, DOI 10.1086/70168; Karra AS., EUR J PHYS ED SPORT, DOI [10.5281/zenodo.3686322, DOI 10.5281/ZENODO.3686322; Langdon JL, 2019, PHYS EDUC SPORT PEDA, V24, P16, DOI 10.1080/17408989.2018.153074; Liu C., 2019, FRONT ED RES, V2, P4; Loprinzi PD, 2020, PHYSICIAN SPORTSMED, V48, P400, DOI 10.1080/00913847.2020.175854; Loro WA, 2019, J ORTHOP SURG-HONG K, V27, DOI 10.1177/230949901983145; Okuda PMM, 2019, TRENDS PSYCHIATR PSY, V41, P51, DOI 10.1590/2237-6089-2018-001; Mohamed AA, 2020, DIABETES METAB SYND, V14, P489, DOI 10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.03; Newman TJ., 2019, THESIS OHIO STATE ; Nicolini C, 2019, CORTEX, V115, P172, DOI 10.1016/j.cortex.2019.01.01; Pallesen H, 2019, J CENT NERV SYST DIS, V11, DOI 10.1177/117957351984349; Perry J, 2019, J CLIN SPORT PSYCHOL, V13, P41, DOI 10.1123/jcsp.2017-001; Ramos RM, 2019, GERONTOL GERIATR MED, V5, DOI 10.1177/233372141985969; Simonsmeier BA, 2018, SPORT EXERC PERFORM, V7, P155, DOI 10.1037/spy000011; Southgate Erica, 2019, International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction, V19, P19, DOI 10.1016/j.ijcci.2018.10.00; Xianjia Z., 2019, STUD MUSICOL, V6",21,1,1,1,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

High order super twisting sliding mode system has the advantages of traditional sliding mode control system. Super twisting system can elimination control chatter due to the discontinuities of control variable which contain in traditional sliding mode system. The super twisting system is designed. The saturation function replaces the sign function in the super twisting control function to improve the smoothness of the control variable. The simulation shows that this design has excellent precision. Inverted pendulum has smaller movement stroke than traditional super twisting system.

In this study, the ultrasonic-assisted organic acid removal of cadmium from mining soil was investigated using the following setup: 0.1 mol/L citric and oxalic acid, a 1:20 solid-liquid ratio, and 30 min of ultrasonic-assisted time. A cadmium removal rate of 69.10% was obtained when using organic acids, while it was only 61.82% for removal by oscillation extraction. This implies that the ultrasonic-assisted removal method has beneficial effects on the removal of cadmium via organic acid. Speciation analysis of cadmium in mining soils before and after organic acid removal was performed using the Tessier sequential extraction procedure. The results showed that exchangeable species and those bound to manganese, iron and carbonates were lower after ultrasonic-assisted organic acid removal. This indicates that organic acids can remove most of the removable cadmium from soil in mining areas fast and efficiently.","[Li, Xiao-Fen; Xiong, Hua-bin; Gao, Yun-tao] Yunnan Minzu Univ, Sch Chem & Environm, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Gao, YT (corresponding author), Yunnan Minzu Univ, Sch Chem & Environm, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",644465478@qq.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [201367025, 21665027]; Applied Basic Research Project of Yunnan Province Youth Program [2017FD118]; Scientific research fund project of Yunnan Education Department [2021J0656]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO. 201367025 and NO. 21665027) and by the Applied Basic Research Project of Yunnan Province Youth Program (NO. 2017FD118), and Scientific research fund project of Yunnan Education Department (NO. 2021J0656).","Chen HY, 2015, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V512, P143, DOI 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.01.02; Deng JC, 2009, CHEM ENG J, V152, P177, DOI 10.1016/j.cej.2009.04.03; Feng HP, 2018, ENVIRON SCI-NANO, V5, P1595, DOI [10.1039/c8en00348c, 10.1039/C8EN00348C; Hu YN, 2013, ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R, V20, P6150, DOI 10.1007/s11356-013-1668-; Hwang SS, 2007, J IND ENG CHEM, V13, P65; Li ZY, 2014, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V468, P843, DOI 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.08.09; Lin HL, 2015, SPECTROSC SPECT ANAL, V35, P3275, DOI 10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2015)11-3275-0; Liu DX, 2016, WATER AIR SOIL POLL, V227, DOI 10.1007/s11270-016-2788-; Liu XM, 2013, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V463, P530, DOI 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.06.06; Lu YL, 2015, ENVIRON INT, V77, P5, DOI 10.1016/j.envint.2014.12.01; Mao XH, 2015, J HAZARD MATER, V285, P419, DOI 10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.12.00; Meegoda JN, 2001, J HAZARD MATER, V85, P73, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3894(01)00222-; Onireti OO, 2017, CHEMOSPHERE, V170, P161, DOI 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.12.02; Park B, 2017, ULTRASON SONOCHEM, V35, P640, DOI 10.1016/j.ultsonch.2016.02.00; Ren L., 2016, J ENVIRON MONITOR, V5, P12; Sun FS, 2004, J ENVIRON SCI-CHINA, V16, P95; Tu Jian-cheng, 2011, China Environmental Science, V31, P128; Yin HB, 2011, ENVIRON RES LETT, V6, DOI 10.1088/1748-9326/6/4/04401; Yuvaraja T, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P348, DOI 10.1177/002072091881599; Zhang CL., 2014, ENV SCI TECHNO, V37, P12; Zhang HJ, 2018, ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R, V25, P6899, DOI 10.1007/s11356-017-0971-; Zhang HJ, 2017, ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R, V24, P9506, DOI 10.1007/s11356-017-8660-; Zheng Y, 2013, ADV MATER RES-SWITZ, V726-731, P2368, DOI 10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.726-731.236; Zimmerman Amanda Jo, 2010, Int J Anal Chem, V2010, P387803, DOI 10.1155/2010/38780",24,0,0,2,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Currently majority of these firms follow a manual approach of hiring employees which is more prone to errors and time consuming. Prime purpose of the research is to develop an intelligent predictive model to decide upon candidate's suitability for an applied It based job. A sample size of 13,168 instances with 19 attributes of job seekers data are used for study. An ensemble predictive meta model approach is presented in the research where a stacked KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours) algorithm combined with hard voting approach is employed. The idea is to use a single unified predictive model in place of separate classification models by considering the predicted class with maximum votes against each class label. The proposed approach comprises two functional modules. 'Stacked KNN Learner Module' involves the use of five variants of KNN which include 1-NN, 3-NN, 5-NN, 7-NN and 9-NN. Individual prediction of the job seeker data from these variants of KNN algorithm are input to the 'Hard Voting Ensemble Predictive unit' which eventually aggregates majority of predicted class votes determined for each class label to generate the final output predicted class label on basis of maximum votes. The developed ensemble meta model is successfully implemented using python programming language and its performance evaluation is done using various metrics. The implemented model generated a 96.96% prediction accuracy rate. The specificity, sensitivity and f-score value recorded was 96.36%, 96.06% and 96.26% respectively. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root mean Square Error (RMSE) value observed with our proposed meta model was 0.0048 and 0.0102 respectively. A comparative analysis of the proposed model was done by varying the data sample size and it gave a consistent performance throughout. It was observed that proposed ensemble model gave an impressive 96.96% mean accuracy rate and the overall performance of other variants was consistent. Performance of proposed meta model was also compared with some existing techniques like C.45, CART and K-Means. It outperformed other techniques in terms of accurately predicting the class label of candidates applying for job. This ensemble meta model can be of great help for growing IT firms and assist the organization unit in hiring right and deserving candidates in future. Proposed work can act as a decision making framework in multi sector units with enormous work force to streamline performance appraisal process thereby enabling in hiring right people for right job.","[Mishra, Sushruta; Mallick, Pradeep K.; Tripathy, Hrudaya K.] Deemed Univ, Sch Comp Engn, Kalinga Inst Ind Technol, Bhubaneswar 751024, India; [Jena, Lambodar] SOA Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Bhubaneswar, India; [Chae, Gyoo-Soo] Baekseok Univ, Div Informat & Commun Engn, Cheonan, South Korea","Mishra, S (corresponding author), Deemed Univ, Sch Comp Engn, Kalinga Inst Ind Technol, Bhubaneswar 751024, India.",sushruta.mishrafcs@kiit.ac.in,"Tripathy, Hrudaya Kumar/AAD-2590-2019; Mallick, Pradeep/AAU-7923-2021; Jena, Lambodar/ABH-2564-2021",,,,"Aaboud M, 2016, J HIGH ENERGY PHYS, P1, DOI 10.1007/JHEP09(2016)00; Ab Aziz MTR, 2016, AIP CONF PROC, V1761, DOI 10.1063/1.496084; Ade R, 2014, 2014 FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORKS & SOFT COMPUTING (ICNSC), P384, DOI 10.1109/CNSC.2014.690665; Agaoglu M, 2016, IEEE ACCESS, V4, P2379, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2016.256875; Alalwan N, 2019, IEEE ACCESS, V7, P98725, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.292814; Almalis N, 2016, 6 INT C INF INT SYST, DOI [10.1109/IISA.2015.7388018, DOI 10.1109/IISA.2015.7388018; [Anonymous], 2010, PROCEEDING 19 ACM IN, DOI DOI 10.1145/1871437.187174; Ayesha S., 2010, EUR J SCI RES, V43, P2; Aziz AA, 2015, J TEKNOL, V75, P1; Ben-Zadok G, 2009, RES REFLECT INNOV IN, P; Breaugh JA, 2009, HUM RESOUR MANAGE R, V19, P219, DOI 10.1016/j.hrmr.2009.02.00; Brozina C, 2019, IEEE ACCESS, V7, P163686, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.294587; Cavnar W.B., 1994, P 3 ANN S DOC AN INF, V48113, P16; Chaudhari P., 2016, 2016 IEEE 1 INT C PO, P; Conijn Rianne, 2017, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, V10, P17, DOI 10.1109/TLT.2016.261631; Dietz-Uhler B, 2013, J INTERACT ONLINE LE, V12, P1; Dudley NM, 2006, J APPL PSYCHOL, V91, P40, DOI 10.1037/0021-9010.91.1.4; Guo SQ, 2016, EXPERT SYST APPL, V60, P169, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2016.04.01; Huang S, 2013, COMPUT EDUC, V61, P133, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2012.08.01; Jantawan B., 2013, INT J COMPUT SCI INF, V11, P; Jantawan B., 2007, INT J INNOV RES COMP, V3297, P458; Kanimozhi KV, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091989419; Katore Lokesh S., 2015, Proceedings of 2015 Global Conference on Communication Technologies (GCCT), P503, DOI 10.1109/GCCT.2015.734279; Kazi Asma Shahid, 2017, J RES REFLECT ED, V2, P18; Khan Z.

Human behavior recognition is a basic technology in the fields of intelligent monitoring and human-computer interaction in education. The dynamic changes of human skeleton provide important information for the recognition of educational behavior. Traditional methods usually use manual information to label or traverse rules only, resulting in limited representation capabilities and poor generalization performance of the model. In this paper, a kind of dynamic skeleton model with residual is adopted-a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network based on residual connections, which not only overcomes the limitations of previous methods, but also can learn the spatio-temporal model from the skeleton data. In the big bone NTU-RGB + D dataset, the network model not only improved the representation ability of human behavior characteristics, but also improved the generalization ability, and achieved better recognition effect than the existing model. In addition, this paper also compares the results of behavior recognition on subsets of different joint points, and finds that spatial structure division have better effects.","[Zhang, Yinong; Guan, Shanshan; Xu, Cheng; Liu, Hongzhe] Beijing Union Univ, Beijing Key Lab Informat Serv Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yinong; Guan, Shanshan] Beijing Union Univ, Coll Urban Rail Transit & Logist, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Cheng; Liu, Hongzhe] Beijing Union Univ, Coll Robot, Beijing, Peoples R China","Xu, C (corresponding author), Beijing Union Univ, Beijing Key Lab Informat Serv Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xc-f4@163.com,,"Xu, Cheng/0000-0003-4913-5371; Liu, Hongzhe/0000-0003-2314-5272","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61871039, 61906017, 61802019]; Beijing Municipal Commission of Education Project [KM202111417001, KM201911417001]; National Engineering Laboratory for Agri-product Quality Traceability Project [AQT-2020-YB2]; Supporting Plan for Cultivating High Level Teachers in Colleges and Universities in Beijing [IDHT20170511]; Big Data Collaborative Innovation Center for Intelligent Driving [CYXC1902]; Academic Research Projects of Beijing Union University [ZK80202001, XP202015, BPHR2020EZ01, BPHR2019AZ01, 202011417004, 202011417005]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61871039, 61906017, 61802019), the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education Project (No.KM202111417001, KM201911417001), National Engineering Laboratory for Agri-product Quality Traceability Project (No. AQT-2020-YB2), the Supporting Plan for Cultivating High Level Teachers in Colleges and Universities in Beijing (Grant No. IDHT20170511), the Big Data Collaborative Innovation Center for Intelligent Driving (Grant No. CYXC1902), the Academic Research Projects of Beijing Union University(No. ZK80202001, XP202015, BPHR2020EZ01, BPHR2019AZ01, 202011417004, 202011417005).","Cai YL, 2017, PATTERN RECOGN, V69, P39, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2017.03.03; Cao CQ, 2018, IEEE T CYBERNETICS, V48, P1095, DOI 10.1109/TCYB.2017.275684; Ke Q, 2017, PROC CVPR IEEE, P4570, DOI 10.1109/CVPR.2017.48; Keyvanpour MR, 2020, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V79, P31819, DOI 10.1007/s11042-020-09485-; Kim TS, 2017, IEEE COMPUT SOC CONF, P1623, DOI 10.1109/CVPRW.2017.20; Kong YH, 2019, J ELECTRON IMAGING, V28, DOI 10.1117/1.JEI.28.4.04303; Levine S, 2016, J MACH LEARN RES, V1; Liu ONZ, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091989419; Liu J, 2016, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V9907, P816, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-46487-9_5; Ning GH, 2018, IEEE T MULTIMEDIA, V20, P1246, DOI 10.1109/TMM.2017.276201; Pareek P, 2021, ARTIF INTELL REV, V54, P2259, DOI 10.1007/s10462-020-09904-; Shotton J, 2013, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V35, P2821, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.2012.24; Stember JN, 2019, J DIGIT IMAGING, V32, P597, DOI 10.1007/s10278-019-00220-; Tarroni G, 2019, IEEE T MED IMAGING, V38, P1127, DOI 10.1109/TMI.2018.287850; Veinidis C, 2019, INT J IMAGE GRAPH, V19, DOI 10.1142/S021946781950018; Wu ST, 2018, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V77, P10437, DOI 10.1007/s11042-017-4440-; Xu Y, 2019, WIREL NETW, V25, P3735, DOI 10.1007/s11276-018-1667-; Yao GL, 2019, PATTERN RECOGN LETT, V118, P14, DOI 10.1016/j.patrec.2018.05.01; Yuan QQ, 2019, IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE, V57, P1205, DOI 10.1109/TGRS.2018.286519; Zhao ZJ, 2020, IEEE ACCESS, V8, P114044, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.300286",20,0,0,1,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In particular, the situation can be more crucial for electrical power engineering education due to the importance of the direct relationship between the students and their instructor embodied in the campus' classroom interaction and the requisite face-to-face learning. Apparently, e-learning instructional design has provided a fairly accepted solution through online lectures and exams for power engineering courses. Nevertheless, the difficulty persists in moving the experiment equipment of the laboratories to the homes of the students since most experiments were likely to be carried out on the University campus' dedicated power system panels. An urgent and reduced cost solution is therefore needed. This paper introduces a shortcut design method as a compensatory solution at no extra cost, which during this challenging period is suitable for teaching power system labs and also suitable for full online education programs. The work presented in the paper goes beyond that to discuss the relevance to ABET student outcomes. Two experiments are presented in the PowerWorld Simulator environment with systematic steps to facilitate the expansion of the rest of the laboratory experiments. The method is based on the simulation of a textbook example and the verification of results from another textbook followed by a discussion of the relevant students' outcomes of ABET. The paper may be used as an educational guide for instructors in the following academic year in institutions that embrace distance learning programs.","[Mohamed, Omar; Bitar, Zain; Abu-Sultaneh, Alla; Elhaija, Wejdan Abu] Princess Sumaya Univ Technol, King Abdullah II Sch Engn, Amman 11941, Jordan","Mohamed, O (corresponding author), Princess Sumaya Univ Technol, King Abdullah II Sch Engn, Amman 11941, Jordan.",o.mohamed@psut.edu.jo,"Mohamed, Omar/T-5774-2019; Abu El Haija, Wejdan/AAA-5982-2020","Mohamed, Omar/0000-0003-0618-2012; Abu El Haija, Wejdan/0000-0001-7990-3138",,,"ABET Accreditation Website, 1996, CRIT 3 STUD OUT; Beru RG., 2013, P 120 ASEE ANN C EX; Glover JD, 2017, CENGAGE LEARNING, V6t; Grainger J.J., 1994, POWER SYSTEM ANA; Guney I, 2014, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V51, P134, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.51.2.; Karnavas YL, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V57, P202, DOI 10.1177/002072091879142; Milano F, 2008, IEEE T EDUC, V51, P17, DOI 10.1109/TE.2007.89335; Ngundam JM, 2001, POWER ENG J, V15, P211, DOI 10.1049/pe:2001040; Oliveira TL, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091987905; Omer M, 2011, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V48, P423, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.48.4.",10,3,3,1,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

However, in the research of computer-aided language system, there are still some deficiencies in the recognition of English spoken stress nodes, which cannot be well recognized. Based on this, this paper proposes a method of English spoken accent recognition based on natural language processing and endpoint detection algorithm, which aims to promote the accuracy of accent recognition in the computer-aided language system and improve the performance of the computer-aided language system. In order to avoid the interference of background noise, this paper proposes a short-term time-frequency endpoint detection algorithm which can accurately judge the beginning and end of speech in complex environment. Then, on the basis of traditional speech feature extraction and fractal dimension theory, a nonlinear fractal dimension speech feature is extracted. Finally, RankNet is used to process the extracted features to realize the recognition of English spoken stress nodes. In the simulation analysis, the application effect of the short-term time-frequency endpoint detection algorithm proposed in this paper in the complex background noise and the effect of non-linear fractal dimension speech features on the recognition of English spoken stress nodes are verified. Finally, the performance and good application effect of the method designed in this paper are illustrated.","[Yue, Tieyan] Harbin Engn Univ, Foreign Language Dept, Harbin 150000, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China","Yue, TY (corresponding author), Harbin Engn Univ, Foreign Language Dept, Harbin 150000, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",yty_heu@126.com,,,,,"Amirsadri S, 2018, NEURAL COMPUT APPL, V30, P3707, DOI 10.1007/s00521-017-2952-; Cunningham DJ, 2017, LANG LEARN TECHNOL, V21, P7; Fontan L, 2017, J SPEECH LANG HEAR R, V60, P2394, DOI 10.1044/2017_JSLHR-S-16-026; Gowda D, 2017, J ACOUST SOC AM, V142, P1542, DOI 10.1121/1.500151; Iskhakov Tagir, 2018, Proceedings in Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, V18, P1, DOI 10.1002/pamm.20180023; Jiaen Z, 2018, INT J SPEECH TECHNOL, V7, P13; Kuroiwa S., 2016, ACOUST SOC AM J, V140, P344; Laghos A., 2018, SOCIAL NETWORKING, V7, P17; Lebedeva NN., 2015, USP FIZIOL NAUK, V45, P5; [李文彬 Li Wenbin], 2017, [电子学报, Acta Electronica Sinica], V45, P45; Meguehout H, 2017, INT J SPEECH TECHNOL, V20, P363, DOI 10.1007/s10772-017-9412-; Miao M., 2016, COMPUT ENG APPL, V19, P77; Mnassri A., 2017, INDIAN J SCI TECHNOL, V10, P1, DOI DOI 10.17485/ijst/2017/v10i27/11494; Pianosi F, 2015, ENVIRON MODELL SOFTW, V70, P80, DOI 10.1016/j.envsoft.2015.04.00; Redkina NS, 2018, AUTOM DOC MATH LINGU, V52, P91, DOI 10.3103/S000510551802007; Sayad A, 2018, BIOSENS BIOELECTRON, V100, P96, DOI 10.1016/j.bios.2017.08.06; Shi LF, 2015, J SPEECH LANG HEAR R, V58, P497, DOI 10.1044/2015_JSLHR-H-14-024; Song Y, 2014, WSDM'14: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 7TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEB SEARCH AND DATA MINING, P83, DOI 10.1145/2556195.255623; Torres J, 2018, CAN MOD LANG REV, V74, P128, DOI 10.3138/cmlr.377; Wan J, 2014, COMM COM INF SC, V463, P14; Yamazaki K, 2018, RECALL, V30, P214, DOI 10.1017/S095834401700035; Zheng H, 2018, GLOBAL MARKETS, V1, P20",22,1,1,1,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Video monitoring, criminal identification, building access control, and unmanned and autonomous vehicles are only a few examples of concrete applications that are becoming increasingly attractive to industry. Various techniques are being developed, including local, holistic, and hybrid approaches, which use only a few face image characteristics or the entire facial features to provide a face image description. Many methods have good results, if there are sufficiently representative training samples per person, in the face recognition system. Facial part finding and extraction show the utmost vital role in face and age recognition. In this research work a new algorithm is proposed for Face and Age Recognition (FAR) by using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine (RBF-SVM) classifier, and Rotational Local Binary Pattern (RLBP). RLBP is utilized for the selection and extraction of features from the face image. In this algorithm, extract the face component like Nose, Mouth, Left and Right eye. In the preprocessing stage median filter is used to remove noises from the face image. By using this, there is an improvement in the feature extraction procedure. In pattern recognition, a basic errand is finding a picture from the picture parts. For the implementation of results FG-NET ((Face and Gesture Recognition Network) and AT&T datasets are used. The detection rate of face recognition has reached up to 92-98% and the detection rate for age recognition is 87%.

However, there have been few studies on the probabilistic forecasts of LLWS obtained from ensemble prediction system. In this study, we analyzed a reliability analysis to verify LLWS ensemble member forecasts and observation based on the limited grid points around Jeju International Airport in Jeju. Homogeneous and non-homogeneous regression models were used to reduce the bias and dispersion existing ensemble prediction system and to provide probabilistic forecast. Prior to applying probabilistic forecast model, reliability analysis was conducted by using rank histogram to identify the statistical consistency of LLWS ensemble forecasts and corresponding observations. Based on the results of our study, we found that LLWS ensemble forecasts had a consistent positive bias, indicating over-forecasting, and were under-dispersed for all seasons. To correct such biases, homogeneous regression and non-homogeneous regressions as EMOS (Ensemble Model Output Statistics) and EMOS exchangeable model by assuming exchangeable ensemble members were applied. The prediction skills of the methods were compared by the mean absolute error and continuous ranked probability score. We found that the prediction skills of probabilistic forecasts of EMOS exchangeable model were superior to the bias-corrected forecasts in terms of deterministic prediction.","[Lee, Young-Gon] Korea Meteorol Adm, Radar Planning Team, Weather Radar Ctr, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Chansoo] Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Appl Math, Gongju 32588, South Korea","Kim, C (corresponding author), Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Appl Math, Gongju 32588, South Korea.",chanskim@kongju.ac.kr,,"Kim, Chansoo/0000-0002-7594-9072",Kongju National University,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is supported by the research grant of the Kongju National University in 2020.","Baran S, 2015, Q J ROY METEOR SOC, V141, P2289, DOI 10.1002/qj.252; Baran S, 2014, COMPUT STAT DATA AN, V75, P227, DOI 10.1016/j.csda.2014.02.01; Bertsekas DP., 1999, NONLINEAR PROGRAMMIN, V2nd, P1; Delle Monache L, 2006, J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS, V111, DOI 10.1029/2005JD00691; Fraley C, 2010, MON WEATHER REV, V138, P190, DOI 10.1175/2009MWR3046.; Gneiting T, 2005, MON WEATHER REV, V133, P1098, DOI 10.1175/MWR2904.; Gneiting T, 2007, J AM STAT ASSOC, V102, P359, DOI 10.1198/01621450600000143; Grimit EP, 2002, WEATHER FORECAST, V17, P192, DOI 10.1175/1520-0434(2002)017<0192:IROAMS>2.0.CO;; Hamill TM, 2001, MON WEATHER REV, V129, P550, DOI 10.1175/1520-0493(2001)129<0550:IORHFV>2.0.CO;; Han K, 2018, ASIA-PAC J ATMOS SCI, V54, P91, DOI 10.1007/s13143-017-0062-; Han K, 2016, ASIA-PAC J ATMOS SCI, V52, P495, DOI 10.1007/s13143-016-0034-; Junk C, 2015, MON WEATHER REV, V143, P2909, DOI 10.1175/MWR-D-15-0095.; Karthick S, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091989107; Lee YG, 2020, ATMOSPHERE-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/atmos1102019; Lerch S, 2013, TELLUS A, V65, DOI 10.3402/tellusa.v65i0.2120; Ma YC, 2018, ADV MECH ENG, V10, DOI 10.1177/168781401775415; Raftery AE, 2005, MON WEATHER REV, V133, P1155, DOI 10.1175/MWR2906.; Sloughter JM, 2010, J AM STAT ASSOC, V105, P25, DOI 10.1198/jasa.2009.ap0861; Thorarinsdottir TL, 2010, J R STAT SOC A STAT, V173, P371, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-985X.2009.00616.; Wesonga R, 2019, SIMUL-T SOC MOD SIM, V95, P171, DOI 10.1177/003754971878895; Wilks D.S., 2011, STAT METHODS ATMOSPH, V3rd editio; Zhou B., 2005, 21 C WEATH AN THREA; Zhou B., 2004, 11 C AV RANG AER OC",23,1,1,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

However, most of the earlier studies have GPU memory utilization, computational time, and accuracy limitations. The main contribution of this paper is to present a novel algorithm called the Mixed Mode Database Miner (MMDBM) classifier by implementing multithreading concepts on a large number of attributes. The proposed method use the quick sort algorithm in GPU parallel computing to overcome the state of the art limitations. This method applies the dynamic rule generation approach for constructing the decision tree based on the predicted rules. Moreover, the implementation results are compared with both SLIQ and MMDBM using Java and GPU with the computed acceleration ratio time using the BP dataset. The primary objective of this work is to improve the performance with less processing time. The results are also analyzed using various threads in GPU mining using eight different datasets of UCI Machine learning repository. The proposed MMDBM algorithm have been validated on these chosen eight different dataset with accuracy of 91.3% in diabetes, 89.1% in breast cancer, 96.6% in iris, 89.9% in labor, 95.4% in vote, 89.5% in credit card, 78.7% in supermarket and 78.7% in BP, and simultaneously, it also takes less computational time for given datasets. The outcome of this work will be beneficial for the research community to develop more effective multi thread based GPU solution in GPU mining to handle large set of data in minimal processing time. Therefore, this can be considered a more reliable and precise method for GPU computing.","[Nayak, Soumya Ranjan] Amity Univ Uttar Pradesh, Amity Sch Engn & Technol, Noida 201313, India; [Sivakumar, S.] Koneru Lakshamiah Educ Fdn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, KLEF, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Bhoi, Akash Kumar] Sikkim Manipal Univ SMU, Sikkim Manipal Inst Technol SMIT, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Majitar, India; [Chae, Gyoo-Soo] Baekseok Univ, Div Informat & Commun Engn, Cheonan, South Korea; [Mallick, Pradeep Kumar] Deemed Univ, Sch Comp Engn, Kalinga Inst Ind Technol, Bhubaneswar, India","Nayak, SR (corresponding author), Amity Univ Uttar Pradesh, Amity Sch Engn & Technol, Noida 201313, India.",nayak.soumya17@gmail.com,"Mallick, Pradeep/AAU-7923-2021; Nayak, Soumya Ranjan/S-5908-2018; Bhoi, Akash Kumar/G-8518-2016","Nayak, Soumya Ranjan/0000-0002-4155-884X; Bhoi, Akash Kumar/0000-0003-2759-3224; s, sivakumar/0000-0003-3076-0900",,,"Akgobek O, 2013, TURK J ELECTR ENG CO, V21, P1223, DOI 10.3906/elk-1202-2; Chang HH., 2017, 8 INT C GRAPH IM PR; Chen SF, 2009, J CHIN INST ENG, V32, P915, DOI 10.1080/02533839.2009.967157; Chiu CC, 2011, P 13 INT C INF INT W, P39; Cuda C., 2017, PROGRAMMING GUIDE T; Czarnul P, 2020, SCI PROGRAMMING-NETH, V2020, DOI 10.1155/2020/417679; David BK., 2012, PRAISE PROGRAMMING ; Engel TA, 2014, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V32, P93, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2014.05.40; Farber R, 2011, CUDA APPLICATION DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT, P; Ghorpade J., 2012, ADV COMP INT J, V3, P10; John S., 1996, P 22 VLDB C SAN ANT, P96; Kalaiselvi T, 2017, INFORM MED UNLOCKED, V9, P13; Khan A, 2020, SCI PROGRAMMING-NETH, V2020, DOI 10.1155/2020/581271; Khan A, 2020, SCI PROGRAMMING-NETH, V2020, DOI 10.1155/2020/462119; Knight, 2014, MOUNTAINS PLAINS ECO, P83, DOI DOI 10.1038/ng.14; Kubat M, 1997, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V1224, P14; Manish M., 1996, JORMA SLIQ FAST SCA; Naz N, 2020, MATH PROBL ENG, V2020, DOI 10.1155/2020/483987; Nvidia C., 2010, NVIDIA CUDA PROGRAM; Piatetsky-Shapiro D., 1991, KNOWLEDGE DISCOVER; Quinlan J.

J,"Wu, Q1",,,,"Wu, Qian",,,Pressure source of athletes in field based on improved hierarchical K-means algorithm,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION,,,English,Article; Early Access,,,,,,Sports events; psychological stress; stress source analysis; K-means clustering algorithm,BLOOD-PRESSURE; QUESTIONNAIRE,"Nowadays, with the development of economy, sports industry attracts more and more people's attention, and the number and scale of sports events continue to expand. But the fierce competition, for athletes, is not only physical competition, psychological competition is particularly important. Psychological pressure is an important factor that affects athletes to play at a high level in the competition field. How to analyze the pressure source of athletes in the competition field is very important for athletes to overcome the competition pressure. Therefore, this paper designs a method based on the improved hierarchical K-Means clustering algorithm (KMCA) to analyze the pressure source of athletes in the competition field, so as to help athletes overcome the pressure on the competition field and promote their high-level performance. In this method, firstly, 182 athletes were investigated by questionnaire to obtain the data of related psychological pressure sources. Secondly, because KMCA is sensitive to the selection of initial class center, the performance of KMCA is directly related to the selection of initial class. Aiming at the problem of KMCA, this paper proposes an improved hierarchical KMCA. Finally, the improved hierarchical KMCA is applied to the clustering analysis of sports competition pressure source data. Through simulation analysis, compared with KMCA, the improved layered KMCA proposed in this paper has a good performance improvement. The improved hierarchical KMCA proposed in this paper can be applied to the analysis of the pressure source of athletes in the competition field, which can analyze the pressure of athletes and get the characteristics of the pressure of athletes, so as to help athletes overcome the pressure in the competition field and achieve the mental health of the competition field?","[Wu, Qian] Jilin Sport Univ Coll, Changchun 130000, Jilin, Peoples R China","Wu, Q (corresponding author), Jilin Sport Univ Coll, Changchun 130000, Jilin, Peoples R China.",wenjia-lny@163.com,,,,,"Arce C, 2012, SPAN J PSYCHOL, V15, P1529, DOI 10.5209/rev_SJOP.2012.v15.n3.3943; Arzani M., 2014, Research Journal of Environmental Sciences, V8, P14; Balduck AL, 2010, SCAND J MED SCI SPOR, V20, P779, DOI 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2009.01020.; Bretz J, 2019, PSYCHOTHER PSYCH MED, V69, P176, DOI 10.1055/a-0583-109; Coker-Cranney A, 2015, J CLIN SPORT PSYCHOL, V9, P213, DOI 10.1123/jcsp.2014-005; De Francisco C, 2018, INT J SPORTS SCI COA, V13, P1008, DOI 10.1177/174795411878748; Huang XH, 2018, KNOWL-BASED SYST, V151, P165, DOI 10.1016/j.knosys.2018.03.02; Kent S, 2018, J SPORT SCI MED, V17, P4; Liu HY, 2018, MEAS PHYS EDUC EXERC, V22, P263, DOI [10.1080/1091367X.2018.1430577, 10.1080/1091367x.2018.1430577; Manju VN, 2018, IET IMAGE PROCESS, V12, P218, DOI 10.1049/iet-ipr.2017.043; McGee V, 2019, J CLIN SPORT PSYCHOL, V13, P152, DOI 10.1123/jcsp.2018-001; Mitchell MS, 2019, ACAD MANAGE J, V62, P531, DOI 10.5465/amj.2016.064; Mohammadi NM, 2018, ACTA GEOCHIM, V37, P102, DOI 10.1007/s11631-017-0161-; More P, 2018, REV INT SOCIOL, V76, DOI 10.3989/ris.2018.76.1.16.2; Onan N, 2019, PERSPECT PSYCHIATR C, V55, P233, DOI 10.1111/ppc.1234; Rhind DJA, 2012, INT J SPORTS SCI COA, V7, P121, DOI 10.1260/1747-9541.7.1.12; Martinez-Alvarado JR, 2019, AN PSICOL-SPAIN, V35, P341, DOI 10.6018/analesps.35.2.34282; Sadeghi Zerisfi A., 2018, IRAN J EPIDEMIOL, V14, P4; Sanna KM., 2019, PSYCHIATRIA, V16, P; Soliman EZ, 2017, CIRCULATION, V136, P440, DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.02844; Vieira Lenamar Fiorese, 2013, Rev. bras. educ. fís. esporte, V27, P26",21,0,0,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

At the same time, Chinese people's mastery of English is gradually improving. Grasping the foundation of this period can effectively improve students' English level, and it will play a very important role in further learning English or job hunting in the future. Therefore, how to improve the interest of college school students in English learning and improve their ability and level of English learning is particularly important. Virtual community refers to a group of people who communicate and discuss through the Internet and are willing to share some knowledge and information in the exchange, and gradually develop into a social network aggregation. This paper designs an English learning platform for college school students based on virtual community and image processing technology. The platform is developed with SSM framework. After the development, the platform is tested for college school students in several schools in Xi'an. The experimental results show that the system can effectively stimulate students' interest in learning English, and then improve students' vocabulary and academic performance, which provides an effective reference for the study of students' learning methods.","[Wang, Han] Xian Phys Educ Univ, Sch Sports Journalism & Commun, Xian 710068, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Wang, H (corresponding author), Xian Phys Educ Univ, Sch Sports Journalism & Commun, Xian 710068, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",9217198@qq.com,,,,,"Boetcher S., 2009, WHAT IS VIRTUAL COM; Bressler SE., 2000, COMMUNITIES COMMERC; Chen YM, 2015, J CENT SOUTH UNIV, V22, P168, DOI 10.1007/s11771-015-2507-; Chin T, 2016, PLOS ONE, V11, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.016217; Fei CB, 2017, ADV ENERGY MATER, V7, DOI 10.1002/aenm.20160201; Geng XY, 2008, SCI ED LIT COLLECT L, P9; Hagel J., 1998, NETWORK INTERESTS E; Jenny P, J COMPUT-MEDIAT COMM, DOI [10.1111/j.1083-6101.2005.tb00264.x, DOI 10.1111/J.1083-6101.2005.TB00264.X; Jiang QZ, 2017, J MATER SCI TECHNOL, V33, P1087, DOI 10.1016/j.jmst.2017.06.01; Jin Y., 2012, LIB INFORM WORK, V56, P7; Joe L., 2017, INFORM COMPUTER THEO, P7; Lave W., 2011, SITUATED LEARNING LE, P2; Li MJ., 2015, RES CONTINUOUS USE ; Li X, 2018, CLUSTER COMPUT, V21, P907, DOI 10.1007/s10586-017-0951-; Li XX., 2013, RES SOCIAL NETWORK ; Meifeng FX., 2011, LIB INFORM WORK, V55, P6; Pan HZ, 2016, CELL RES, V26, P190, DOI 10.1038/cr.2016.; Porter CE, 2008, MANAGE SCI, V54, P113, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.1070.076; Preece J, 2005, J COMPUT-MEDIAT COMM, V1; Rai A, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091988379; Rheingold Howard., 1993, VIRTUAL COMMUNITY H; Sheikh W, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091986640; Wan SH, 2020, MOBILE NETW APPL, V25, P743, DOI 10.1007/s11036-019-01445-; [王新玲 Wang Xinling], 2016, [中国实验方剂学杂志, Chinese Journal of Experimental Traditional Medical Formulae], V22, P4; Wang Z, 2017, CHIN J NAT MEDICINES, V15, P474, DOI 10.1016/S1875-5364(17)30071-; Yilmaz R, 2016, COMPUT HUM BEHAV, V63, P373, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2016.05.05; Zhang BC, 2016, CHIN J MED LIB INFOR, V25, P7; Zhang CK, 2018, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 26TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NUCLEAR ENGINEERING, 2018, VOL ; Zhang L., 2015, OPEN CYBERNET SYST J, V9, P233; Zhou JH., 2017, MICROCOMPUT APPL, V33, P5; Zhou XP, 2018, IEEE T KNOWL DATA EN, V30, P1178, DOI 10.1109/TKDE.2017.278443; Zhu BZ, 2018, COMPUT ECON, V52, P105, DOI 10.1007/s10614-017-9664-",33,1,1,7,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

English is a compulsory component of education from the early school years in Saudi Arabia, and the Ministry of Education invests a great deal of workforce and financial resources in this sector in a concerted effort to ensure that Saudi students attain language proficiency. The study employed a mixed-method research design and was conducted with 85 undergraduate learners at Qassim University. It used a questionnaire and interviews to obtain insight into the factors that inhibit the English learning experience. Results revealed that the respondents' resistance to the learning of others' culture stems mainly from the epistemic and cultural barriers embedded in English language learning. Implications of the study will provide the basis to policymakers, educationists, institutions, and learners for contextualizing the English language curriculum of Saudi Arabia.","[Alfallaj, Fahad S.

Nowadays, online learning has become a common learning style, but online learning resource providers are also faced with the charging issue. Besides, a large number of studies have been made by scholars at home and abroad in this field. In this paper, the influence of middle school students' self-efficacy on online learning resource purchase intention is analyzed, and the study comprises two stages. To be specific, in the first stage, the interview method is adopted to acquire related materials, and the grounded theory is also followed to reconstruct the theoretical research framework; in the second stage, the theoretical framework is empirically verified by the questionnaire. Then, it is found that middle school students' self-efficacy affects the identity about online learning resources' perceived quality and their purchase intention for online learning resources. At the same time, the teacher-student relation may also reinforce students' purchase intention for online learning resources. Thus, it can be seen that online learning resources' perceived quality and the intimate teacher-student relation have significant influence on middle school students' purchase intention.","[Chen, Guomin; Jin, Yingwei; Liang, Wang; Liu, Yang] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; Jilin Business & Technol Coll, Changchun, Peoples R China","Chen, GM (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.",dr.chen@mail.dlut.edu.cn,"guomin, chen/AAD-6775-2021; Chen, Guomin/AAG-3282-2021","Chen, Guomin/0000-0002-1171-2711; Chen, Guomin/0000-0003-0753-9415",,,"Ablikim M, 2015, PHYS REV D, V91, P2006, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.91.09200; [Anonymous], 2015, MOD REMOTE E; Chen W., 2016, PSYCHOL DEV ED, V32, P35; Chen X.

Agricultural production structure is closely related to water resources and grain yield. Optimizing agricultural industrial structure is related to the national economy and people's livelihood, and has a great impact on the economic development of a region. In this paper, an optimization model based on conjugate cooperative game is established to verify the influence on the development of agricultural industrial structure, and propose solutions. The research has good innovation and guidance. In view of the unreasonable regional industrial structure, starting with the fundamental theoretical research of the regional industrial structure adjustment, a conjugate matching cooperative game method is used to establish a regional industrial structure optimization model. The results suggest that: Wheat planting area is increased by 1.1%, maize planting area is decreased by 40.5%, beans planting area is increased by 16.5%, potato planting area is increased by 18.3%, oil crops planting area is decreased by 5.5%, vegetable planting area is increased by 4.2%, and forage planting area is increased by 5.9%. The proportion of food crops: cash crops: forage is adjusted from 50.0: 11.7: 38.3 to 27.1: 28.7: 44.2, and the structure of agriculture and animal husbandry tends to be rationalized. In this paper, the conjugate matching cooperative game method is used to analyze the model, and the optimization method of regional industrial structure is proposed, which can help agricultural industry to improve production and promote the further optimization of industrial structure.","[Wang, Lin] Haikou Univ Econ, Sch Business Adm, Haikou 571127, Hainan, Peoples R China","Wang, L (corresponding author), Haikou Univ Econ, Sch Business Adm, Haikou 571127, Hainan, Peoples R China.",whu05@qq.com,,,planned project of philosophy and social sciences of Hainan Province: Research on Optimization and Adjustment of Industrial Structure in Hainan Province Constrained by Resources and Environment [HNSK(YB)19-44]; special project of philosophy and social sciences of Hainan Province: The Innovative Research on the Evolution of Island Ecological Civilization and the Division of Green Industry Recycling Type [HNSK(ZX)18-118],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was awarded the planned project of philosophy and social sciences of Hainan Province: Research on Optimization and Adjustment of Industrial Structure in Hainan Province Constrained by Resources and Environment (Grant NO.

This paper mainly studies how to use B/S architecture and MVC design pattern according to the characteristics of college physics teaching, including user management and system function modules. In order to illustrate the role of virtual experiment scene based College Physics Teaching Platform in college physics learning, a virtual physics laboratory teaching platform based on B/S three-tier structure system and MVC mode is constructed by using Java, VRML and flash interactive technology. Based on the advantages of virtual technology, this platform starts with the construction of a teaching platform of virtual experiment scene, analyzes students' mastery of university physics experiments before and after the use of it, and then carries out a systematic survey of students' satisfaction, thus obtaining the influence of this teaching platform on university physics learning of college students. The results show that the platform constructed in this paper can help college students better grasp the operation of physical experiments, so as to better understand the relevant knowledge points in college physics learning, and has a good reference value.","[Cheng, Lin; Zhao, Xiao-Gang; Xu, Chun-Long; Hou, Zhao-Yang] Changan Univ, Coll Sci, Xian 710064, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Niu, Wen-Cheng] Xian Qujiang 1 High Sch, Xian, Peoples R China","Cheng, L (corresponding author), Changan Univ, Coll Sci, Xian 710064, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",Chenglin@chd.edu.cn,,,,,"Barata PNA, 2015, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V52, P203, DOI 10.1177/002072091558386; Anony M., 2011, SPRING FRAMEWORK RE; Brett M, 2015, STUD EARLY MEDIEV BR, P; Chai Q., 2009, CHINA ED TECHNIQUE E, P6; Fan XY., 2017, FUJIAN COMPUT, V33, P3; Gao H., 2009, TECHNICAL RES CS B; Jia YC, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091986741; Jing W, 2012, RES EXPLOR LAB, V31, P6; Kleinschmidt JH, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091986743; Li JW, 2017, ACSR ADV COMPUT, V59, P17; Li XT, 2009, SCI TECHNOL INFORM, P19; Liu Y., 2011, RES VIRTUAL SCENE M; Liu YP., 2011, J MICROCOMPUT, V27, P16; Lv ZH, 2020, NEURAL COMPUT APPL, V32, P9593, DOI 10.1007/s00521-019-04472-; Lv ZH, 2020, IEEE INTERNET THINGS, V7, P4616, DOI 10.1109/JIOT.2019.295458; Lv ZH, 2017, NEUROCOMPUTING, V254, P71, DOI 10.1016/j.neucom.2016.07.07; Ma ZY., 2016, CHEM ENG EQUIP, P30; Oncel AF, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P208, DOI 10.1177/002072091878871; Qi LY, 2017, IEEE J SEL AREA COMM, V35, P2616, DOI 10.1109/JSAC.2017.276045; Qiao YH., 2003, CHINESE J ECOL, V23, P205; Wang F., 2005, J XIAN JIAOTONG U, V40, P138; Wang HX., 2008, DESIGN IMPLEMENTATI; Wang XY, 2017, ACM T INTEL SYST TEC, V9, DOI 10.1145/307885; Xu YJ., 2013, GUANGDONG CHEM IND, V40, P17; Yan JF., 2000, RES WEB DATABASE VI; Zhai B, 2010, CHINA SCI TECHNOL EX, P30; Zhai P., 2015, COMPUT NETW, V41, P4; Zhang YW, 2017, EXAMINATION WEEKLY, P2; Zhu, 2006, COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY, V16, P22",29,1,1,9,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In this study, an online translation platform based on artificial intelligence was selected for exploration. Use SQLite software database server as text data source. When the user performs English translation, the query word will be input into the translation platform, and at the same time, the artificial intelligence Google API translation technology will translate the text. Based on the collected actual user service usage records, build edge computing solutions and analyze user data input records. Use word2vec to construct the feature vector of the word, and use LSTM to construct the word ranking of the text. The word ranking method is used to predict the user's service usage, select the corresponding edge server, and combine the relevant probability model to preload the service. Combined with the edge algorithm compression data processing technology of the Internet of Things, the data is synchronized and tracked. After the data is compressed, the translated text is displayed on the application interface in the form of voice and words. The research results show that the use of edge computing of the Internet of Things increases the preservation rate of historical query records of intelligent translation by 30%, and the intelligent translation platform predicts that the matching degree of users' translation queries is 90%. The use of edge algorithm compression technology of the Internet of Things can greatly save the network traffic and bandwidth of the server. The optimized query algorithm can improve query efficiency, save query time, and increase users' enthusiasm for learning English.","[Li, Panpan] Zaozhuang Univ, Dept Coll English, Zaozhuang, Peoples R China; [Ning, Yuwen] Fourth Mil Med Univ, Ctr Informat Technol, Xian 710032, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Fang, Hongjuan] Zaozhuang Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Zaozhuang, Peoples R China","Ning, YW (corresponding author), Fourth Mil Med Univ, Ctr Informat Technol, Xian 710032, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",ningyuwen2020@126.com,,,2019 research project of China Medical Degree Graduate Education Steering Committee [YX2019-03-02],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by 2019 research project of China Medical Degree Graduate Education Steering Committee.

At present, the mainstream prediction method is to use neural network and autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity to build models, which is a more scientific way, and also verified the feasibility of the way in many studies. In order to improve the accuracy of financial market trend prediction, this paper studies in detail the neural network system represented by BP and the autoregressive conditional heterogeneous variance model represented by GARCH. Analyze its structure and algorithm, combine the advantages of both, create a GARCH-BP model, and transform its combination structure and optimize the algorithm according to the uniqueness of the financial market, so as to meet the market as much as possible Characteristics. The novelty of this paper is the construction of the autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model, which lays the foundation for the prediction of financial market trends through the construction of the model. However, there are some shortcomings in this article. The overall overview of the financial market is not very clear, and the prediction of the BP network is not so comprehensive. Finally, through the actual data statistics of market transactions, the effectiveness of the GARCH-BP model was tested, analyzed and researched. The final results show that model has a good effect on the prediction and trend analysis of market, and its accuracy and availability greatly improved compared with the previous conventional approach, which is worth further study and extensive research It is believed that the financial market prediction model will become one of the mainstream tools in the industry after its later improvement.","[Yin, Xinzhe; Li, Jinghua] Sichuan Int Studies Univ, Sch Int Business, Chongqing, Peoples R China","Li, JH (corresponding author), Sichuan Int Studies Univ, Chongqing 400031, Peoples R China.",jinghuali@sisu.edu.cn,,,,,"Aloui C, 2015, FINANC UVER, V65, P3; [Anonymous], 2015, ADV J FOOD SCI TECHN, DOI DOI 10.19026/AJFST.7.252; [Anonymous], 2014, ENERGY POWER EN; [柏丹丹 Bai Dandan], 2015, [太阳能学报, Acta Energiae Solaris Sinica], V36, P79; Charfeddine L, 2016, PHYSICA A, V444, P487, DOI 10.1016/j.physa.2015.09.06; Chen H., 2016, J ELECTR ENG TECHNOL, V31, P9; Deng Y, 2019, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V26, P1154, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2019.06.01; Dyhrberg AH, 2016, FINANC RES LETT, V16, P85, DOI 10.1016/j.frl.2015.10.00; Graves A, 2016, NATURE, V538, P471, DOI 10.1038/nature2010; Hayo B, 2015, J BANK FINANC, V59, P27, DOI 10.1016/j.jbankfin.2015.06.00; He W, 2016, IEEE T CYBERNETICS, V46, P620, DOI 10.1109/TCYB.2015.241128; Klionsky Daniel J., 2016, Autophagy, V12, P1, DOI 10.1080/15548627.2015.110035; Lei N, 2016, J VIBROENG, V18, P83; Papayannidis C, 2015, BLOOD CANCER J, V5, DOI 10.1038/bcj.2015.8; Raslain S, 2018, IET IMAGE PROCESS, V12, P2011, DOI 10.1049/iet-ipr.2018.552; Rezaie-Balf M, 2019, IJST-T CIV ENG, V43, P103, DOI 10.1007/s40996-018-0151-; Sin KJ, 2017, AIP CONF PROC, V1830, DOI 10.1063/1.498099; Weninger F, 2015, J MACH LEARN RES, V16, P54; Yan JJ., 2015, FINAN TRADE EC, V36, P7; Zarkovic MD, 2015, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V52, P81, DOI 10.1177/002072091557054",20,0,0,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Without good listening comprehension ability, it is impossible to use language flexibly to communicate. Due to the influence of traditional education mode, Chinese students' English listening is generally poor. Therefore, a new English listening teaching mode is needed to help students improve their English listening. In this paper, multimedia network technology is used to realize the integrated English listening teaching of listening, speaking and dictation skills, and a multimedia network English listening teaching model based on speech recognition confidence learning algorithm is proposed. In order to improve the effectiveness of the mainstream confidence method based on Lattice posterior probability, this paper proposes an improved confidence algorithm based on Lattice posterior probability, and then converts the obtained confidence score into discriminant confidence score by Support Vector Machine(SVM) to further enhance the discriminant ability of confidence. Aiming at the imbalance of training data, a score correction strategy is proposed. The experiment shows that the English listening teaching model realized by using multimedia network technology can effectively enhance the students interest in learning and improve their listening ability. And the improvement of the mainstream confidence method based on Lattice posteriori probability can effectively improve the recognition ability of the algorithm and further improve the students' English listening learning effect.","[Yao, Yubing; Ma, Congying] Cangzhou Tech Coll, Sch Int Educ & Exchange, Cangzhou 061001, Hebei, Peoples R China","Ma, CY (corresponding author), Cangzhou Tech Coll, Sch Int Educ & Exchange, Cangzhou 061001, Hebei, Peoples R China.",1423222846@qq.com,,,Hebei Association of Social Science [201704040104],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The study was supported by Hebei Association of Social Science (Grant No. 201704040104).","Aoki S, 2014, EUR PHYS J C, V74, DOI 10.1140/epjc/s10052-014-2890-; Bot RI, 2016, EURO J COMPUT OPTIM, V4, P3, DOI 10.1007/s13675-015-0045-; Chou HT, 1998, RADIO SCI, V33, P1277, DOI 10.1029/98RS0188; Chouzenoux E, 2016, J GLOBAL OPTIM, V66, P457, DOI 10.1007/s10898-016-0405-; Erfani SM, 2016, PATTERN RECOGN, V58, P121, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2016.03.02; Girard SN, 2010, NANO LETT, V10, P2825, DOI 10.1021/nl100743; Kim S, 2017, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V26, P6019, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2017.275040; Liu YX, 2019, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V78, P18653, DOI 10.1007/s11042-019-7205-; Mohan R, 1999, IEEE T MULTIMEDIA, V1, P104, DOI 10.1109/6046.74817; Narayan P, 2017, J HIGH ENERGY PHYS, DOI 10.1007/JHEP08(2017)08; Reem D, 2017, INVERSE PROBL, V33, DOI 10.1088/1361-6420/33/4/04400; Schonherr H, 1997, LANGMUIR, V13, P3769, DOI 10.1021/la960561; Sellamanickam S., 2016, ICML, V9, P136; Srdjan S., 2016, MULTIMEDIA SIG SYS, V716, P28; Wang B, 2018, IEICE T FUND ELECTR, VE101A, P1132, DOI 10.1587/transfun.E101.A.113; Wang QJ, 2019, INT J PATTERN RECOGN, V33, DOI 10.1142/S021800141959015; Wei N., 2017, ACOUST SOC AM J, V141, P391; You QZ, 2016, PROCEEDINGS OF THE NINTH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEB SEARCH AND DATA MINING (WSDM'16), P13, DOI 10.1145/2835776.283577; Zhao Y, 2019, INT J SYST SCI, V50, P2853, DOI 10.1080/00207721.2019.169071; Zhou X, 2017, IETE J RES, V63, P662, DOI 10.1080/03772063.2017.130999; Zhu BZ, 2019, APPL ENERG, V233, P196, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.04",21,0,0,4,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This paper hopes to provide effective help by joint intelligent algorithms. In this paper, the particle swarm optimization algorithm in intelligent optimization algorithm and the FCM algorithm in cluster analysis are studied in depth, and the two are merged together to propose a fuzzy clustering algorithm based on improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. The main research contents of this thesis include: Firstly, the PSO algorithm is improved, and the random search step levy flights and PSO algorithm are repeatedly called by the iterative mode by introducing the eagle strategy. After improvement, the ESPSO algorithm can achieve a balance between global search and local development, and make the particles have more satisfactory search ability and convergence effect. Then the improved PSO algorithm is integrated into the FCM algorithm to solve the above problems of the FCM clustering algorithm and improve the clustering effect. The experimental results show that the improved espso algorithm and FCM algorithm are suitable for actual data. The simulation results show that the algorithm has better clustering effect than the traditional clustering algorithm.","[Cui, Jiangning] China Univ Min & Technol, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cui, Jiangning] Shandong Womens Univ, Jinan, Peoples R China","Cui, JN (corresponding author), China Univ Min & Technol, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",cuijnsd@126.com,,,,,"Acemoglu D., 2018, SOC SCI ELECT PUBLIS, V33, P13; Annand D, 2015, INT REV RES OPEN DIS, V16, P; Arulkumar S., 2017, J COMPUTATIONAL THEO, V14, P343; Bai XZ, 2018, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V26, P1946, DOI 10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.275682; Bierbaum L., 2015, POLICY FUTURE ED, V12, P26; Chunmao Jiang, 2018, Journal of Beijing Institute of Technology, V27, P189, DOI 10.15918/j.jbit1004-0579.201827.020; Ehsan Z., 2015, MODARES MECH ENG, V14, P19; Gomezreino M., 2018, IIE T, V27, P56; Grijalva RAMM., 2018, URBAN REV, V50, P; Kuo PH, 2016, KNOWL ENG REV, V32, P1, DOI 10.1017/S026988891600015; Ling SH, 2016, ENG APPL ARTIF INTEL, V47, P68, DOI 10.1016/j.engappai.2015.03.00; Memon KH, 2017, IET IMAGE PROCESS, V11, P1, DOI 10.1049/iet-ipr.2016.028; Munoz DA, 2016, INT J EDUC MANAG, V30, P809, DOI 10.1108/IJEM-03-2015-002; Oliveira EJ, 2018, PESQUI AGROPECU BRAS, V53, P1338, DOI [10.1590/S0100-204X2018001200006, 10.1590/s0100-204x2018001200006; Olivo Richard F, 2015, J Undergrad Neurosci Educ, V13, pA12; Raj AS., 2018, J COMPUT THEOR NANOS, V15, P40; Shahraki H, 2017, INT J MACH LEARN CYB, V8, P1827, DOI 10.1007/s13042-016-0561-; TIGHT M, 1987, HIGH EDUC Q, V41, P162, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2273.1987.tb01774.; Xu Y, 2018, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V10, DOI 10.3390/su1007230; Yang W, 2019, INT J INTELL SYST, V34, P439, DOI 10.1002/int.2206",20,0,0,2,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Constructivism plays a huge role in college English teaching, by enabling students to give full play to their initiative and enthusiasm. Simultaneously, the use of multimedia technology provides ideal conditions for constructivism to apply to college English teaching. Building a reasonable application of theory in the classroom English teaching, multimedia helps college teachers to optimize the classroom teaching and improve the English teaching quality. Information technology and network, has been fully utilized in the service of teaching, providing the teachers with new teaching ideas and techniques, and bringing the teaching new vitality. This paper discusses and explores how constructivism directs multimedia-assisted English teaching. Designed under the theory of constructivism, experiments were conducted on 188 sophomore students in teaching the course of college English intensive reading. The results of the experiments show the organic combination of constructivism and multimedia assistance can promote the effectiveness of college English teaching, and greatly improve students' learning ability as well.","[Du, Wei] Shenyang Inst Engn, Sch Foreign Languages, Shenyang 110136, Peoples R China; [Liang, Xin] Shenyang Normal Univ, Foreign Language Teaching Dept, Shenyang, Peoples R China","Du, W (corresponding author), Shenyang Inst Engn, Sch Foreign Languages, Shenyang 110136, Peoples R China.",383933350@qq.com,,,,,"Adam W, 1996, NUCL INSTRUM METH A, V371, P12, DOI 10.1016/0168-9002(95)01134-; Berardi-Wiltshire A, 2018, HDB RES PRACT HERIT, V125, P; Daoping X., 2019, FRONT ED RES, V009, P9; EL-Deghaidy H, 2015, INT J SCI MATH EDUC, V13, P1539, DOI 10.1007/s10763-014-9560-; King N, 2020, BRIT J EDUC PSYCHOL, V90, P790, DOI 10.1111/bjep.1233; Kriegler S, 2015, CHILD SOC, V29, P604, DOI 10.1111/chso.1209; Morales-Lopez E, 2019, COMPLEX APPL LANG CO, V788, P12; Neely KC, 2017, PSYCHOL SPORT EXERC, V30, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.psychsport.2017.01.00; OLeary C, 2014, SOCIAL DIMENSIONS AU, P1; Panda A, 2015, 16TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOCIATION (INTERSPEECH 2015), VOLS 1-5, P20; Pianezzi D, 2016, QUAL RES ACCOUNT MAN, V13, P370, DOI 10.1108/QRAM-09-2015-008; Pillay S, 2014, EDUC TRAIN, V56, P254, DOI 10.1108/ET-11-2012-011; PRAWAT RS, 1992, AM J EDUC, V100, P354, DOI 10.1086/44402; Saunders W., 1992, SCHOOL SCI MATH, V92, P136, DOI [10.1111/j.1949-8594.1992.tb12159.x, DOI 10.1111/J.1949-8594.1992.TB12159.X; Scholten P., 2017, Policy Soc, V36, P34; Seal W, 2016, QUAL RES ACCOUNT MAN, V13, P330, DOI 10.1108/QRAM-06-2015-005; Somekh B, 1993, TEACHERS DEVELOP TEACHERS RESEARCH, P2; Taber KS, 2017, HDB DIGIT LEARN K 12, V440, P379; Tan M, 2015, DISCIPLIN INTUIT LEA, V95; Tanil G., 2014, PERSPECTIVES EUROPEA, V15, P48; Walter A.I., 2006, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V7, P252, DOI [DOI 10.1108/14676370610677838, 10.1108/14676370610677856",21,2,2,17,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Based on the theory of accessibility, this paper analyzes the accessibility of distance education resources by using multi constraint model. The primary school education resources in the former Haishu District of Ningbo City are taken as examples to evaluate the accessibility to educational resources in all the primary schools in the district under the walking mode, the public transport mode, and the driving mode, respectively. The study shows that the areas with high accessibility to education resources in Haishu District are mainly distributed in places with developed road networks, large scale schools, and developed public transport networks, while those places with low accessibility are mainly located in the peripheral area. There are significant differences in the accessibility under different modes of transport, and the accessibility in the driving mode is superior to that in the public transport mode and the walking mode. In comparison, the correction effect on the accessibility in the public transport mode and the driving mode is average. Based on the multiple constraint model, the correction effect on the accessibility in the walking mode is significant. According to the analysis results, suggestions are put forward to promote the balanced development of educational resources in the Haishu District.","[Yi, Dilan] Shaoyang Univ, Org Dept Communist Party, Shaoyang 422000, Hunan, Peoples R China","Yi, DL (corresponding author), Shaoyang Univ, Org Dept Communist Party, Shaoyang 422000, Hunan, Peoples R China.",156679412@qq.com,,,,,"Alsmadi Y, 2014, ASEE ANNU CONF EXP; Chen K, 2018, CLIN J AM SOC NEPHRO, V13, P387, DOI 10.2215/CJN.0965091; Erdemir US, 2018, J FOOD COMPOS ANAL, V69, P71, DOI 10.1016/j.jfca.2018.02.00; Ezeamama AE, 2018, PLOS NEGLECT TROP D, V12, DOI 10.1371/journal.pntd.000552; Gies T, 2018, LEARN PUBL, V31, P69, DOI 10.1002/leap.114; Guo YQ, 2018, SOC INDIC RES, V138, P1, DOI 10.1007/s11205-017-1658-; LeBoeuf RL, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P155, DOI 10.1177/002072091875625; Liossi C, 2018, PAIN, V159, P631, DOI 10.1097/j.pain.000000000000114; Mauk MG., 2017, P 2017 ASEE ANN C E; Mills S, 2017, INT J BEHAV NUTR PHY, V14, DOI 10.1186/s12966-017-0567-; Mudd AE, 2019, INT J EQUITY HEALTH, V18, DOI 10.1186/s12939-019-0962-; Nistor M, 2018, IEEE T SMART GRID, V9, P240, DOI 10.1109/TSG.2016.254993; Panagiotopoulos G, 2019, APPL SPAT ANAL POLIC, V12, P567, DOI 10.1007/s12061-018-9256-; Shin H, 2019, BMJ OPEN, V9, DOI 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-02411; Shorey S, 2018, J MED INTERNET RES, V20, DOI 10.2196/jmir.918; Stentzel U, 2018, BMC HEALTH SERV RES, V18, DOI 10.1186/s12913-018-3143-; Van de Velde F, 2018, J FOOD COMPOS ANAL, V72, P22, DOI 10.1016/j.jfca.2018.05.00; Walshe NC, 2019, SIMUL HEALTHC, V14, P398, DOI 10.1097/SIH.000000000000037; Whitney J, 2012, J POSTSECOND EDUC DI, V25, P13",19,0,0,5,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

With greater exposure to the internet and foreign media, travel to other countries, and observation of the country's immigrant populations' cultures, the young Saudis are changing their perception of the native culture. Though it is too early to identify the nature and extent of these changes, these are perceptible at least on the educational campuses. Though not very pronounced because of the Saudi culture is very deeply rooted and firm, these changes can be perceived during informal conversation setups. A certain degree of inhibition also laces the young people's views, unsure as they are to the reaction of society to their changed perceptions. It is essential to understand these changing perceptions of the young Saudi people so that the impressions formed by them may be given a positive turn vis-a-vis the rich Saudi heritage and ancient cultural ethos, while at the same time, ensuring that the nation walks in tandem with its compatriots across the globe. This study takes a phenomenological qualitative research approach, seeing the opinions of fifty proficient English students at Qassim University via a self-report survey to gather data on their behaviors and attitudes vis-a-vis learning English and native culture.","[Alfallaj, Fahad Saleh Suleiman] Qassim Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept English & Translat, Methnab, Buraydah, Saudi Arabia; [Al-Ma'amari, Ahmed Ali Hassan] Qassim Univ, Coll Educ, Dept Psychol, Buraydah, Saudi Arabia; [Aldhali, Fahad Ibraheem Abdullah] Qassim Univ, Coll Sharia & Islamic Studies, Dept Quran Studies, Buraydah, Saudi Arabia","Alfallaj, FSS (corresponding author), Qassim Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept English & Translat, Methnab, Buraydah, Saudi Arabia.",f.alfallaj@qu.edu.sa,,,Qassim University [mcs-ths-2019-2-2-I-5427],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors gratefully acknowledge Qassim University represented by the Deanship of Scientific Research, on the financial support for this research under the number mcs-ths-2019-2-2-I-5427 during the academic year 1440AH/2019AD.","Ahmed K., 2011, TEACHING LEARNING AR, P11; Alfarhan I., 2016, AM RES J ENGLISH LIT, V1, P; Alfuraih A., 2016, J ED SOC RES, V6, P9; Alhawsawi S., 2014, INVESTIGATING STUDE; Birner B.

Combined with the theory of AVC, the theoretical basis for the expression of regional culture in the planning and construction of rural landscape is put forward. The results show that after the construction of the AVC evaluation system for the special terrain and deep cultural heritage of Dang village in Hancheng City, Shaanxi Province, the comprehensive AVC score of Dang village landscape is 0.3121, and the comprehensive scores of attraction, vitality, and capacity are 0.3055, 0.2985, and 0.3381, respectively. In summary, it is concluded that although Dang village has a good cultural environment and profound background, it lacks reasonable development and orderly planning measures, resulting in the gradual loss of its unique regional culture. Finally, combined with the AVC evaluation and analysis results, suggestions for the follow-up construction planning of Dang village are put forward and applied to practical teaching research. The results can provide a reference for studying the expression of regional culture in landscape planning and design.","[Wang, Xin] LanZhou JiaoTong Univ, Sch Art & Design, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China","Wang, X (corresponding author), LanZhou JiaoTong Univ, Sch Art & Design, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.",wangxin@mail.lzjtu.cn,,,,,"Agnoletti M, 2018, FORESTS, V9, DOI 10.3390/f908047; Almeida M, 2016, LAND USE POLICY, V53, P44, DOI 10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.09.02; Amato F, 2017, J CULT HERIT, V23, P44, DOI 10.1016/j.culher.2015.12.00; Di Fazio S, 2018, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V10, DOI 10.3390/su1011383; Gullino P, 2018, J RURAL STUD, V57, P99, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.12.00; Guo R, 2019, LAND-BASEL, V8, DOI 10.3390/land812019; Kiruthiga K, 2019, FRONT ARCHIT RES, V8, P94, DOI 10.1016/j.foar.2018.09.00; McAndrews C, 2016, ACCIDENT ANAL PREV, V97, P231, DOI 10.1016/j.aap.2016.09.00; Mu B, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V12, DOI 10.3390/su1207286; Pramanik MK, 2016, MODEL EARTH SYST ENV, V2, DOI 10.1007/s40808-016-0116-; Rovai M, 2016, LAND USE POLICY, V56, P217, DOI 10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.04.03; Silva C, 2020, ASIAN GEOGR, V37, P117, DOI 10.1080/10225706.2019.170150; Stenseke M, 2016, LANDSCAPE RES, V41, P199, DOI 10.1080/01426397.2015.113531; Stober D, 2018, MORAV GEOGR REP, V26, P285, DOI 10.2478/mgr-2018-002; Sun JX, 2020, ANN TOURISM RES, V84, DOI 10.1016/j.annals.2020.10297; Udeaja C, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V12, DOI 10.3390/su1206217; Xu M, 2020, INT J SUST DEV WORLD, V27, P250, DOI 10.1080/13504509.2020.172798; Yin M, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/su1110291",18,0,0,15,42,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Our lifestyle has undergone fundamental changes in almost every aspect: network-based computers are used in almost every aspect of social daily life. It has become a means of household information exchange; the number of web-based distance education learners exceeds traditional face-to-face teaching. Therefore, processing power is very important for clever computers to search, analyze, synthesize and exchange information online. In addition to reading and writing, this ability is seen as a new electronic literacy. Those who lack it will be considered illiterate in the near future. Since English has gained the status of a global language, about 85% of the world's electronically stored information is in English, how to inject English learners into electronic culture to ensure the survival of every citizen. The digital age has become the basic task of every educator, especially those who teach English. This paper uses questionnaires and interviews to investigate and analyze the adaptability of college students' English autonomous learning from three aspects: learning concept, learning environment and learning style. The survey results show that students are relatively uncomfortable with English autonomous learning in the multimedia network environment, especially for the online learning environment. On this basis, this paper proposes suggestions for improvement of the current teaching model, in order to help college students to carry out independent learning better.","[Xu, Shuyan] Shangluo Univ, Coll Humanities, Shangluo, Peoples R China; [Xu, Shuyan; Li, Xiang] Guangdong Police Coll, Dept Basic Courses, Guangzhou 510230, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xianhua] Shangluo Univ, Coll Hlth & Management, Shangluo, Peoples R China","Li, X (corresponding author), Guangdong Police Coll, Dept Basic Courses, Guangzhou 510230, Peoples R China.",20050398@gdppla.edu.cn,,,,,"Aladdin A, 2013, PROCD SOC BEHV, V93, P1652, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.10.09; Cao Y, 2015, LECT NOTES ELECT ENG, V217, P1; Chakraborty D, 2014, AUTON AGENT MULTI-AG, V28, P182, DOI 10.1007/s10458-013-9222-; Chen CM, 2019, BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL, V50, P1846, DOI 10.1111/bjet.1267; Godwin-Jones R, 2015, LANG LEARN TECHNOL, V19, P; Hirano A, 2017, INT J INTERDISCIP SO, V12, P; Ismail N, 2012, PROCD SOC BEHV, V66, P472, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.11.29; Jafari S., 2017, ITL INT J APPL LINGU, V168, P7; Lai C, 2019, LANG AWARE, V28, P291, DOI 10.1080/09658416.2019.167567; Lin HF, 2014, LANG LEARN TECHNOL, V18, P12; Mertikopoulos P, 2016, MATH OPER RES, V41, P1297, DOI 10.1287/moor.2016.077; Ning Q., 2015, FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ, V9, P2; Park C, 2019, COMPUT HUM BEHAV, V92, P288, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2018.11.02; Ying J, 2017, AGRO FOOD IND HI TEC, V28, P46; Ying SU., 2016, J CHANGCHUN U TRADIT, V30, P16; Zhang MG, 2012, BIOL CONSERV, V153, P257, DOI 10.1016/j.biocon.2012.04.02; Zhang YB, 2017, J DISCRET MATH SCI C, V20, P323, DOI 10.1080/09720529.2016.118330",17,0,0,6,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Methods 126 primiparas were admitted to our hospital from June 2018 to November 2019 by random sampling method. According to the order of admission of primiparas, they were divided into conventional group (63 cases) and study group (63 cases). The routine group of primiparas were given routine delivery care, while the research group of primiparas were given doula accompanied care by midwives. The time of labor, pregnancy outcome, delivery pain score, delivery control and anxiety score of the two groups were compared and analyzed. Results Compared with the conventional group, the time of the first, second and total labor was significantly shorter in the study group (P < 0.05). The amount of postpartum hemorrhage in the study group was significantly less than that in the conventional group (P < 0.05). The rate of perineal incision and perineal laceration in the study group was significantly lower than that in the conventional group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in Apgar score <8 points compared with the control group (P > 0.05). The scores of pain and anxiety in the second stage of labor were significantly lower in the study group than in the conventional group (P < 0.05). The control score of the puerpera in the study group was significantly higher than that in the conventional group (P < 0.05). Conclusion The intervention measures of companion doula led by midwives can effectively shorten the time of labor, reduce the anxiety and pain score and improve the sense of control during labor of primiparas. This nursing method has clinical promotion and application value.","[Zhang, Lei; Tian, Dan] Capital Med Univ, Beijing Luhe Hosp, Tongshige St, Beijing 101149, Tongzhou Distri, Peoples R China","Tian, D (corresponding author), Capital Med Univ, Beijing Luhe Hosp, Tongshige St, Beijing 101149, Tongzhou Distri, Peoples R China.",z15910774655@163.com,,,,,"Celik E, 2018, ENG SCI TECHNOL, V21, P1104, DOI 10.1016/j.jestch.2018.08.00; Chunlei X, 2012, QILU NURS J, V18, P5; Gailing L, 2020, CAPITAL FOOD MED, V27, P18; Lio-Xiang W, 2019, HEILONGJIANG MED SCI, V42, P16; Mi L, 2020, CONT NURSES, V27, P8; Mosaad AM, 2019, AIN SHAMS ENG J, V10, P755, DOI 10.1016/j.asej.2019.07.00; Qing-Qing X, 2019, CONT MED, V25, P3; Ruixia A, 2018, MOD MED IMAGING, V27, P294; Shumin Y, 2020, CAPITAL FOOD MED, V27, P17; Sun Y, 2020, HENAN MED RES, V29, P56; Wenmin X, 2020, CHIN FOREIGN MED RES, V18, P7; Xiangyue L., 2020, MOD MED HLTH, V36, P43; Xiexiu Y, 2013, CHIN MED INNOVATION, V10, P12; Xinmei Z, 2019, NURS PRACT RES, V16, P9; Yanmei L., 2019, CHIN FOREIGN MED RES, V17, P17; Yuan Y, 2019, PROG MOD BIOMED, V19, P93; Yue R, 2020, MED EQUIP, V33, P18; Zhang YS, 2020, IEEE T MULTIMEDIA, V22, P2844, DOI 10.1109/TMM.2020.296688; Zhen-Ye M, 2019, J PRACT CLIN MED, V23, P11",19,0,0,4,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The circadian rhythm is a phenomenon in which the flow of physical activity is repeated every 24 hours and is synchronized mainly by natural light. However, since people's exposure time to artificial lighting has increased recently, the issue of circadian rhythm imbalance has been raised, and lighting techniques for reproducing the color temperature or wavelength characteristics of natural light have been proposed. There has not been any case for the short-wavelength ratio cycle reproduction of natural light close to the circadian rhythm; thus, a circadian rhythm-assisted LED light that reproduces the short-wavelength ratio of natural light for one day is presented in this paper, and its effect is confirmed through animal experiment. After the lighting control standard is derived through the analysis of natural light characteristics, its periodic short-wavelength ratio is realized through the control of each LED lighting channel. Subsequently, rat-based animal experiment is conducted to analyze the amount of melatonin, a major factor in circadian rhythm. The results confirm that the proposed lighting environment has higher melatonin levels by about 17% (day7) and 24% (day14) compared with the general lighting environment.","[Oh, Seung-Taek] Kongju Natl Univ, Smart Nat Space Res Ctr, Cheonan, South Korea; [Lim, Jae-Hyun] Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Cheonan 31080, Chungcheongnam, South Korea; [Lim, Jae-Hyun] Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Urban Syst Engn, Cheonan, South Korea","Lim, JH (corresponding author), Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Cheonan 31080, Chungcheongnam, South Korea.",defacto@kongju.ac.kr,,"Lim, Jae-Hyun/0000-0001-7169-8969; Oh, SeungTaek/0000-0003-1512-9897","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [2019R1A6A1A03032988, 2020R1I1A3073320]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2019R1A6A1A03032988; 2020R1I1A3073320).","Begemann SHA, 1997, INT J IND ERGONOM, V20, P231, DOI 10.1016/S0169-8141(96)00053-; Berson DM, 2002, SCIENCE, V295, P1070, DOI 10.1126/science.106726; Boyce P, 2016, LIGHTING RES TECHNOL, V48, P101, DOI 10.1177/147715351663457; Brainard GC, 2001, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V86, P433, DOI 10.1210/jc.86.1.43; Chellappa SL, 2011, PLOS ONE, V6, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.001642; 이현아, 2014, [Sleep Medicine and Psychophysiology, 수면정신생리], V21, P5; Farhud D, 2018, IRAN J PUBLIC HEALTH, V47, P106; Figueiro MG, 2008, LIGHTING RES TECHNOL, V40, P153, DOI 10.1177/147715350708729; Hattar S, 2002, SCIENCE, V295, P1065, DOI 10.1126/science.106960; Hernandez-Andres J, 2001, J OPT SOC AM A, V18, P1325, DOI 10.1364/JOSAA.18.00132; Ho-Youn J., 2012, PROC ARCHIT I KOREA, V32, P30; Kim KM, 2020, INDOOR BUILT ENVIRON, V29, P132, DOI 10.1177/1420326X1985542; Kim YS., 2017, INT INF I, V20, P98; Kim YJ, 2015, INT J DISTRIB SENS N, DOI 10.1155/2015/78158; Liu JG., 2018, SID S DIG TECH PAP, V49, P103; Long CM, 2001, ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL, V35, P2089, DOI 10.1021/es001477; Munch Mirjam, 2012, Dialogues Clin Neurosci, V14, P44; Park JiYong, 2015, Korean Journal of Veterinary Research, V55, P13, DOI 10.14405/kjvr.2015.55.1.1; Provencio I, 1998, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V95, P340, DOI 10.1073/pnas.95.1.34; Skene DJ, 1999, REPROD NUTR DEV, V39, P295, DOI 10.1051/rnd:1999030; Trivellin Nicola, 2015, 2015 IEEE 1st International Forum on Research and Technologies for Society and Industry: Leveraging a Better Tomorrow (RTSI).

At present, the dominant agricultural operation modes in China can be roughly divided into three types: family farm mode, agricultural enterprise mode and cooperative mode. Practice has proved that different agricultural operation modes have different effects. In ecological fragile areas, how to adopt agricultural operation modes can not only promote agricultural prosperity and increase farmers' income, but also protect the ecological environment and promote the coordinated development of ecology and economy needs further analysis. Based on the current rural revitalization strategy and ecological protection background, this paper analyzes the operation mechanism of agricultural operation mode from the principal-agent and ecological land rent theory, and analyzes the development dimensions of advantageous agriculture of various modes. On the basis of rural and farmers, this paper provides references for the selection of agricultural operation mode in different regions. There are many factors that need to be considered in the choice of agricultural operation mode in ecological fragile area.

The cross-gradient sharpening detection method is used to collect features and extract information from high-resolution fine-grained three-dimensional images, and establish an edge contour feature detection model for high-resolution fine-grained three-dimensional images. Combining the salient feature analysis method and the subspace feature analysis method to cluster and analyze the high-resolution fine-grained three-dimensional image. In the artificial intelligence environment, the saliency of the three-dimensional image is detected and analyzed, and the multi-dimensional segmentation and gray histogram of the high-resolution fine-grained three-dimensional image are reconstructed through the subspace segmentation method. According to the reconstruction results of the gray histogram, fast 3D image reconstruction and image fusion processing are performed. Finally, the accurate detection and recognition of the reconstructed image is realized. The simulation results show that this method has a good effect on 3D image reconstruction, and the time cost of image reconstruction is relatively short. It improves the recognition and feature analysis capabilities of high-resolution fine-grained 3D images, and has good application value in the reconstruction, detection and recognition of high-resolution fine-grained 3D images.","[An Weigang; Pan Jinxiao] North Univ China, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Taiyuan 030051, Peoples R China","An, WG (corresponding author), North Univ China, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Taiyuan 030051, Peoples R China.",anweigang1807@outlook.com,,,,,"Achanta R, 2012, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V34, P2274, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.2012.12; Altmann Y, 2020, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V29, P2666, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2019.295200; Bayramoglu N, 2016, INT C PATT RECOG, P2440, DOI 10.1109/ICPR.2016.790000; Bjelica M, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P79, DOI 10.1177/002072091775096; Dorj UO, 2018, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V77, P9909, DOI 10.1007/s11042-018-5714-; [傅天宇 Fu Tianyu], 2016, [信号处理, Journal of Signal Processing], V32, P83; Gharbi M, 2016, ACM T GRAPHIC, V35, DOI 10.1145/2980179.298239; Gotmare A, 2015, EXPERT SYST APPL, V42, P2538, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2014.10.04; [黄全亮 Huang Quanliang], 2013, [计算机工程与应用, Computer Engineering and Application], V49, P18; [姜杰 Jiang Jie], 2018, [红外技术, Infrared Technology], V40, P3; Jiang L, 2018, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V27, P4756, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2018.284569; Kamei M., 2018, INT J PAVEMENT ENG, V7, P2949, DOI [10.1371/journal., DOI 10.1080/10298436.2018.1485917; Liu T, 2020, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V710, DOI 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.13640; Mao YW, 2015, NONLINEAR DYNAM, V79, P1745, DOI 10.1007/s11071-014-1771-; Ren Zihan, 2018, Journal of Xiamen University (Natural Science), V57, P438, DOI 10.6043/j.issn.0438-0479.20171201; Xu Zhigang, 2017, Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Natural Science Edition), V45, P38, DOI 10.13245/j.hust.17060; Yu X, 2017, PROC CVPR IEEE, P5367, DOI 10.1109/CVPR.2017.57; Zhang Peng, 2018, Journal of Computer Aided Design & Computer Graphics, V30, P90, DOI 10.3724/SP.J.1089.2018.1691",18,1,1,12,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The aim of this study is to investigate the determinants that influence college students' behavioural intention of using OTPs to acquire knowledge. This study also explores how students' attitude change in using OTPs five months after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic based on a hierarchical component model which is combined by the Social Impact Theory (SIT) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Partial least squares (PLS) analysis is employed to analyse the data collected from 1133 students in Mainland China. The results of the analysis indicate that social impact consists of three dimensions (compliance, identification, internalization) significantly influences college students' attitude toward OTPs and further affects college students' behavioural intention toward OTPs usage. Furthermore, performance expectancy and effort expectancy also positively affect students' behavioural intention toward using OTPs to acquire knowledge. This study makes several suggestions for universities to encourage students using OTPs to cope with the situation of Covid-19 pandemic and for educators to promote online tutoring for reforming universities in the future.","[Cao, Jijuan; Wu, Jun] Guangzhou Panyu Polytech, Sch Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Cao, Jijuan; Lai, Ivan Ka Wai] City Univ Macau, Fac Int Tourism & Management, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China; [Yang, Ting] Jinan Univ, Int Business Sch, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Wu, J (corresponding author), Guangzhou Panyu Polytech, Guangzhou 511483, Peoples R China.",87442733@qq.com,,,"Youth Program of The Education Science Planning Department in Guangzhou [202012523]; Major Projects of Guangdong Provincial Department of Education [2017GWTSCX028]; Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project of Guangzhou Education Bureau [2020KC018, 2019PT102]; Major Scientific Research Platform Cultivation Project of Guangzhou Panyu Polytechnic [2017Y01PY]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported in part by the Youth Program of The Education Science Planning Department in Guangzhou under Grant 202012523, Major Projects of Guangdong Provincial Department of Education under Grant 2017GWTSCX028, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project of Guangzhou Education Bureau under Grant 2020KC018, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project of Guangzhou Education Bureau under Grant 2019PT102, Major Scientific Research Platform Cultivation Project of Guangzhou Panyu Polytechnic under Grant 2017Y01PY.","Aini Q, 2019, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V161, P242, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2019.11.12; Ajzen I., 1980, UNDERSTANDING ATTITU, V27; Bagozzi R.P., 1988, J ACAD MARKET SCI, V16, P7; Bass BM, 2003, J APPL PSYCHOL, V88, P207, DOI 10.1037/0021-9010.88.2.20; DAVIS FD, 1989, MIS QUART, V13, P319, DOI 10.2307/24900; FORNELL C, 1981, J MARKETING RES, V18, P39, DOI 10.2307/315131; Hair JF, 2013, LONG RANGE PLANN, V46, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.lrp.2013.01.00; Hair Jr J.

To ensure smooth construction unloading, the deflection deformation of the large span floor and the field splicing node are monitored. Results show that the prefabricated construction method of the Mianyang Fule International School Gymnasium and the steel column-scaffold combination support system are affordable. After unloading, the floor has the traits of plates and relatively greater rigid reserve. Thus, it is applicable for large-span and high-load floor structure. The stress in the splicing node in the inflection point (L/2, L is the size of the grid) is relatively small, the bolt and the shearing-resistance plate have no slump, and the field splicing node is safe and reliable.

Then, the effect of positive psychology in college teaching is analyzed. Through the research, the results show that when analyzing the positive state of students, most students in life are more active, but in the high school, there are fewer active students, most of them know some compulsory knowledge points to meet the final exams. Most of the students' positive state of learning needs to be improved, and the enthusiasm and initiative of learning are not enough to make any benefit to learning. When analyzing the positive state of teachers, it is found that teachers are more motivated in life. The enthusiasm in the classroom is general, and nearly 80% of the teachers believe that the enthusiasm of life is helpful to the enthusiasm of the classroom; when analyzing the implementation of the three-dimensional goal, it is found that although the teacher emphasizes the importance of the goal of emotional values, less than half of the actual implementation has been put in place. In the analysis of the necessity and feasibility of infiltrating positive psychology in college teaching, it is believed that the use of positive psychology guidance can reduce the burden on students and cultivate positive emotions, scientific values and attitudes towards life. The results show that through the investigation and analysis of the application of positive psychology in college teaching, although there are some shortcomings in the research process, it can still provide reference basis for the application of positive psychology in teaching, with a view to provide a guiding direction for the improvement of future teaching level of colleges and universities.","[Chen, Pei-lin] China Univ Lab Relat, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China","Chen, PL (corresponding author), China Univ Lab Relat, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.",articlecpl@126.com,,"Chen, Pei-lin/0000-0002-5845-6348",,,"Bennett M, 2017, EUR J PSYCHOL EDUC, V32, P643, DOI 10.1007/s10212-016-0321-; Ekinci S, 2017, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V54, P283, DOI 10.1177/002072091668680; Han H, 2019, J POSIT PSYCHOL, V14, P32, DOI 10.1080/17439760.2018.152837; Han X., 2019, ACTA MICROSC, V28, P163; Hendriks T, 2020, J HAPPINESS STUD, V21, P357, DOI 10.1007/s10902-019-00082-; Jans-Beken L, 2019, J POSIT PSYCHOL, V14, P512, DOI 10.1080/17439760.2018.149768; Lutovac S, 2017, EUR J PSYCHOL EDUC, V32, P235, DOI 10.1007/s10212-016-0301-; Lv ZH, 2020, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V109, P103, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2020.03.03; Morgan J, 2016, INT J ENV RES PUB HE, V13, DOI 10.3390/ijerph1305050; Motallebzadeh K, 2018, COGENT PSYCHOL, V5, DOI 10.1080/23311908.2018.142468; Muddeen F, 2016, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V53, P314, DOI 10.1177/002072091663032; Ogbuanya TC, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072092090788; Shankland R, 2017, EDUC PSYCHOL REV, V29, P363, DOI 10.1007/s10648-016-9357-; Shoshani A, 2017, FRONT PSYCHOL, V8, DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.0186; VanMaaren VG, 2016, INNOV HIGH EDUC, V41, P425, DOI 10.1007/s10755-016-9360-; Vela JC, 2016, HISPANIC J BEHAV SCI, V38, P324, DOI 10.1177/073998631665161; Vela JC, 2018, J MULTICULT COUNS D, V46, P2, DOI 10.1002/jmcd.1208; Yang T., INVESTIG CLIN, V59, P35",18,2,2,9,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Based on a two-sector theoretical model, this paper explores the factors restraining the transformation from traditional to modern agriculture and their relationship with economic growth. Using a sample of 31 provinces and cities in mainland China from 1990 to 2016, the results show that the relative price of industrial and agricultural products has a direct impact on the willingness of people to adopt modern technology. Specifically, the relative price of industrial and agricultural products forms a single combined threshold for agricultural modernisation, while the relative productivity of industry and agriculture form a double threshold for per capita GDP, these also show a significant nonlinear relationship. Moreover, the agricultural modernisation of the provinces and cities in the mainland of China is not randomly distributed. There are hot spots with high-value aggregations. The relative productivity has a significant spillover effect on per capita income, and has a negative impact on per capita income in neighbouring areas. Agricultural modernisation can breakthrough economic stagnation and become the driving force for the economy to enter a new round of growth.","[Li, Qian; Zeng, Miao; Du, Jiang] Sichuan Univ, Sch Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China","Du, J (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Sch Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",scucity@163.com,,,,,"[Anonymous], 1990, CONTINUITY CHANCE C; Belagra M, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P293, DOI 10.1177/002072091877305; Benin S, 2015, AGR ECON-BLACKWELL, V46, P103, DOI 10.1111/agec.1220; Bergius M, 2018, J PEASANT STUD, V45, P825, DOI 10.1080/03066150.2016.126055; Cao J, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P285, DOI 10.1177/002072091880353; Chen YH, 2019, AGR ECON-CZECH, V65, P340, DOI 10.17221/399/2018-AGRICECO; Clark G, 2007, PRINC ECON HIST W W; [丁志伟 Ding Zhiwei], 2016, [地理科学进展, Progress in Geography], V35, P; Fan SG, 1997, J DEV ECON, V53, P115, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3878(97)00005-; Galor O, 2011, UNIFIED GROWTH THEORY, P; Galor O, 2000, AM ECON REV, V90, P806, DOI 10.1257/aer.90.4.80; Gao WanLin, 2010, Research of Agricultural Modernization, V31, P25; Hall RE, 1999, Q J ECON, V114, P83, DOI 10.1162/00335539955595; Hansen GD, 2002, AM ECON REV, V92, P1205, DOI 10.1257/0002828026034473; Hossain J, 2017, INT J RENEW ENERGY R, V7, P72; Jones C., 2001, BE J MACROECON ADV, V1, P1, DOI DOI 10.2202/1534-6013.102; Knickel K, 2018, J RURAL STUD, V59, P197, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.04.01; Kogel T, 2001, J ECON GROWTH, V6, P337, DOI 10.1023/A:101274253100; LIN JYF, 1992, AM ECON REV, V82, P3; Lucas Robert E., 2004, EC ED B, VXLIV, P; Maddison Angus, 2001, WORLD EC MILLENNIA; Rivera M, 2018, J RURAL STUD, V59, P242, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.07.00; Takeshima H, 2020, AGR SYST, V177, DOI 10.1016/j.agsy.2019.10269; Takeshima H, 2017, AGR ECON-BLACKWELL, V48, P363, DOI 10.1111/agec.1233; Wang XB, 2016, AGR ECON-BLACKWELL, V47, P309, DOI 10.1111/agec.1223; Wu S., 2001, REV DEV ECON, V5, P375, DOI [10.1111/1467-9361.00130, DOI 10.1111/1467-9361.00130; Yadav D, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P44, DOI 10.1177/002072091775095; Yang DT, 2013, J MONETARY ECON, V60, P367, DOI 10.1016/j.jmoneco.2013.01.00; Young A, 2003, J POLIT ECON, V111, P1220, DOI 10.1086/37853; Zhang XB, 2017, CHINA ECON REV, V43, P184, DOI 10.1016/j.chieco.2017.01.01",30,0,0,18,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

It is believed that competence, as a term, is different in different languages and cultures; the connotation of competence is not completely the same from the perspective of different disciplines. For example, psychology, organizational behavior, enterprise strategic management and philosophy have different focuses on the study of competence, so there are obvious differences in their connotations. It is proposed that the ability of innovative talents is composed of general ability and specialty It is composed of two parts. In addition to general ability, it also includes professional ability, practical innovation ability, special skill, risk bearing ability, team cooperation ability, communication ability, social adaptability ability, democratic participation and management ability, moral ability, competitive ability and sustainable development ability.","[Lu, Xingqi] Zhejian Wanli Univ, Sch Logist & E Commerce, Ningbo 315100, Peoples R China","Lu, XQ (corresponding author), Zhejian Wanli Univ, Sch Logist & E Commerce, Ningbo 315100, Peoples R China.",519493987@qq.com,,,Ningbo key discipline enterprise management discipline construction funds,The author(s) obtained the support of Ningbo key discipline enterprise management discipline construction funds for the research of this article.,"Allen R.E., 1990, CONCISE OXFORD DIC; Beaty RE, 2018, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V115, P1087, DOI 10.1073/pnas.171353211; Boyatzis R.E., 1982, COMPETENT MANAGER M; Chen QL, 2018, CEREB CORTEX, V28, P103, DOI 10.1093/cercor/bhw35; Daus CS, 2005, J ORGAN BEHAV, V26, P453, DOI 10.1002/job.32; DURAND T, 1997, COMPETENCE BASED STR, P12; Farmer S.M., 2017, CREATIVE SELF EFFECT, P23, DOI DOI 10.1016/B978-0-12-809790-8.00002-; Fiori M, 2011, PERS INDIV DIFFER, V50, P329, DOI 10.1016/j.paid.2010.10.01; Flores-Mendoza C., 2018, INTELLIGENCE MEASURE, P4; Forman RKC., 1998, INNATE CAPACITY MYS; Furnham A., 2016, PSYCHOLOGY, V07, P193, DOI 10.4236/psych.2016.7202; Halley D, 2001, CORRECT TODAY, V63, P15; Lee WR, 2015, CHEM SCI, V6, P3697, DOI 10.1039/c5sc01191; LEONARDBARTON D, 1992, STRATEGIC MANAGE J, V13, P111, DOI 10.1002/smj.425013100; Li J, 2006, THEOR RES, V2, P3; Li XZ., 1985, ABILITY PSYCHO; Luo ZL, 2019, IEEE T KNOWL DATA EN, V31, P923, DOI 10.1109/TKDE.2018.284865; Mayer JD, 2016, EMOT REV, V8, P290, DOI 10.1177/175407391663966; MCCLELLAND DC, 1973, AM PSYCHOL, V28, P1, DOI 10.1037/h003409; MCLAGAN PA, 1980, TRAIN DEV J, V34, P2; MEYER MH, 1993, SLOAN MANAGE REV, V34, P2; Nusbaum EC, 2017, PSYCHOL AESTHET CREA, V11, P231, DOI 10.1037/aca000008; Park NK, 2016, CREATIVITY RES J, V28, P1, DOI 10.1080/10400419.2016.112525; PRAHALAD CK, 1990, HARVARD BUS REV, V68, P7; [时勘 Shi Kan], 2006, [心理科学进展, ADVANCES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE], V14, P58; Silvia PJ, 2016, NEW DIR CHILD ADOLES, V151, P111, DOI 10.1002/cad.2014; Spencer L.

Graphic images and animations are the most important part of multimedia information expression. It makes our visual effects of three-dimensional representation of things more vivid, like the plane and three-dimensional we usually see. As with the picture, modern multimedia technology transforms our lives into three dimensions, integration, control, interaction and interaction. For the vivid three-dimensional representation of three-dimensional geometric figures in teaching, not only is it limited to the geometric composition of a piece of chalk, but more with the wide application of multimedia technology, multimedia-assisted teaching, especially multimedia-assisted three-dimensional geometric figure teaching is playing more and more The important role, through the aid of multimedia, has cultivated students' spatial abstract thinking ability and ability to understand graphics and theorems. As multimedia becomes more and more concerned by the education community, this paper is about the question of why multimedia technology should be used to assist the teaching and application of solid geometry applications, and how to apply multimedia technology to achieve the maximum value of the teaching effect of stereo geometry. A lot of experimental research has been carried out. Through experiments, we have built a more complete multimedia assistant teaching system, which is beneficial for students to acquire new knowledge on the Internet. The multimedia technology-assisted three-dimensional geometric method is more conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm and initiative of students than the traditional method. The biggest innovation of this paper is to use the indispensable advantages of traditional teaching to discount the media to the network platform. To some extent, the research in this paper enhances the guiding significance of interactive research to the actual development work.","[Wang, Yu] Xian Univ, Sch Informat Engn, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Wang, Y (corresponding author), Xian Univ, Sch Informat Engn, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",wangyu@xawl.edu.cn,,,Special research program of education department of Shaanxi province [15JK2157]; 2018 key curriculum project of Xi'an university [KGB201825],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Special research program of education department of Shaanxi province (No. 15JK2157). 2018 key curriculum project of Xi'an university, (No. KGB201825).","Baburaj M, 2017, PRECIS ENG, V48, P9, DOI 10.1016/j.precisioneng.2016.10.00; Brumana R, 2018, APPL GEOMAT, V10, P529, DOI 10.1007/s12518-018-0209-; Cavalagli N, 2017, COMPUT STRUCT, V188, P17, DOI 10.1016/j.compstruc.2017.04.00; Chen L, 2017, HEALTHC TECHNOL LETT, V4, P163, DOI 10.1049/htl.2017.006; Cheng YZ, 2017, J MOD OPTIC, V64, P1487, DOI 10.1080/09500340.2017.129511; Cui XY, 2017, MACH VISION APPL, V28, P313, DOI 10.1007/s00138-017-0822-; Dong SY, 2017, IEEE INT C INT ROBOT, P137, DOI [10.1109/CIIS.2017.29, 10.1109/IROS.2017.8202149; Heron PW, 2017, J BIOL CHEM, V292, P19849, DOI 10.1074/jbc.M117.81103; Liang ZF, 2017, ELECTRON LETT, V53, DOI 10.1049/el.2017.241; Martinez PR, 2018, AAPS PHARMSCITECH, V19, P3355, DOI 10.1208/s12249-018-1075-; [闵海根 Min Haigen], 2017, [上海交通大学学报, Journal of Shanghai Jiaotong University], V51, P87; Mohamed A, 2018, EURASIP J IMAGE VIDE, DOI 10.1186/s13640-018-0292-; Pan Y, 2017, J MICRO NANO-MANUF, V5, DOI 10.1115/1.403538; Shopov DY, 2017, CHEM SCI, V8, P1642, DOI 10.1039/c6sc03758; Smoger LM, 2017, J BIOMECH, V58, P187, DOI 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2017.05.00; Talamo A, 2018, ANN NUCL ENERGY, V115, P619, DOI 10.1016/j.anucene.2018.01.01; Tsai D, 2017, IEEE ROBOT AUTOM LET, V2, P912, DOI 10.1109/LRA.2017.265454; Tulyakov S, 2018, ADV SPACE RES, V61, P487, DOI 10.1016/j.asr.2017.10.02; Wu XQ, 2017, J MATER PROCESS TECH, V243, P184, DOI 10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2016.12.01; Zaranis Nicholas, 2018, International Journal of Web-Based Learning and Teaching Technologies, V13, P37, DOI 10.4018/IJWLTT.201801010",20,0,0,7,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Based on the value co-creation theory, taking ZBJ website of Chinese crowdsourcing service platform ranking first on the Alexa platform as an example, the paper constructs the value co-creation process model of crowdsourcing services under the sharing economy from a dynamic perspective through qualitative analysis of the cases of employers and service providers and interview data. It opens the black box of the value co-creation process. Its contribution is that it proposes the dynamic changing rule of three-dimensional interaction, integration and authorization of crowdsourcing service value co-creation, the change of the role of crowdsourcing main body, and the function mechanism of crowdsourcing service value co-creation on crowdsourcing performance. And the value co-creation mode of different stages is determined. The value co-creation mode is the dominant logic of service + product In the release task phase. The value co-creation mode is the value creation of user-led logic originally in the stage of contract submission.

The empirical results show that the greater the power of CFO, the lower the degree of earnings management of the company, indicating that the power of CFO is more of a supervisory role, rather than collusion with the CEO due to interests binding. And the inhibition effect only exists in the sample group of private enterprises. Moreover, the supervision role of CFO power only exists in companies with high robustness and severe agency conflict, which shows that CFO reduces their company's earnings manipulation based on their own conservation and by suppressing opportunism. In addition, CFO power helps improve the effectiveness of their own compensation contracts.","[Gao, Yubin; Mao, Ju] Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Business Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Lingge] Univ Int Business & Econ, Business Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China","Mao, J (corresponding author), Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Business Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China.",maojumaoju@163.com,,,,,"Barua A, 2010, ACCOUNT HORIZ, V24, P25, DOI 10.2308/acch.2010.24.1.2; DECHOW PM, 1995, ACCOUNT REV, V70, P19; FAMA EF, 1983, J LAW ECON, V26, P301, DOI 10.1086/46703; Feng M, 2011, J ACCOUNT ECON, V51, P21, DOI 10.1016/j.jacceco.2010.09.00; FINKELSTEIN S, 1992, ACAD MANAGE J, V35, P505, DOI 10.2307/25648; Florackis C, 2018, J CORP FINANC, V52, P168, DOI 10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2018.08.00; Lara JMG, 2016, J ACCOUNT ECON, V61, P221, DOI 10.1016/j.jacceco.2015.07.00; Helliar ChristineV., 2002, J INT ACCOUNT AUDIT, V11, P165, DOI 10.1016/S1061-9518(02)00068-; JENSEN MC, 1990, J POLIT ECON, V98, P225, DOI 10.1086/26167; Ji L, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V57, P175, DOI 10.1177/002072091881381; Jiang FX, 2015, J CORP FINANC, V32, P190, DOI 10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2014.10.01; Jiang GH, 2010, J FINANC ECON, V98, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.jfineco.2010.05.00; Jiang J, 2010, J FINANC ECON, V96, P513, DOI 10.1016/j.jfineco.2010.02.00; Ke B., MANAGE SC; Khan M, 2009, J ACCOUNT ECON, V48, P132, DOI 10.1016/j.jacceco.2009.08.00; Mian S, 2001, J FINANC ECON, V60, P143, DOI 10.1016/S0304-405X(01)00042-; Pitcher P, 2001, ORGAN SCI, V12, P1, DOI 10.1287/orsc.12.1.1.1012; Wang F, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V57, P73, DOI 10.1177/002072091881381",18,0,0,6,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The arrival of the era of big data has brought a certain impact on China's enterprise management and decision-making, and put forward higher requirements for China's enterprise management and decision-making. Therefore, enterprises need to constantly strive to improve themselves so as to better adapt to the era of big data. In order to keep pace with the development of The Times, major companies and enterprises need to constantly change their internal management methods in order to achieve sustainable and stable development in their own fields and make their management decisions smoother. Among them, optimization and reform of the application of big data are particularly important. Starting from the characteristics of big data and its role in enterprise management decisions, this paper analyzes the current situation of big data management within enterprises and discusses the influence of big data on enterprise management decisions from five aspects, namely, environment, data, participants, organization and technology.

The grading processing of off-line examination is time-consuming. Besides, since the off-line grading is subjective, it is error-prone. In order to address the challenges in off-line examinations of universities, primary and secondary schools, it is very urgent to improve the efficiency of off-line grading. In order to realize intelligent grading for off-line examinations, we exploit deep learning techniques to off-line grading. First, we propose an image processing method for English letters. Second, we propose a image recognition method based on deep learning for English letters. Third, we propose a lightweight framework for grading. Based on the above designs, we design an intelligent grading system based on deep learning. We implement the system and the result shows that the intelligent grading system can batch grading efficiently.

Such as music arrangement, Yunnan musical instruments, the sound characteristics of national music and national musical instruments, and the sound processing knowledge of music processing. You can quickly master basic music arrangement, the sound characteristics of musical instruments, and the knowledge of mixing and processing music. Achieve better teaching results. Most multimedia devices on the market, with the music and sound effects, a high compression mono or stereo transmission. This mono or stereo transmission with a high compression ratio is very low quality. Since audio is far less powerful than visual impact, and the capacity of the disc used to store audio is small, people tend to focus on visual information processing, but ignore the importance of audio. Multi-channel surround sound technology has received more and more attention in the teaching practice of film and television colleges, but it is also affected by various factors such as venue facilities. This has caused bottlenecks in teaching in this field and has greatly affected the teaching effect. This paper designs and constructs a mobile multi-channel surround sound teaching system from a practical perspective. As part of a multimedia teaching device, try to use the best digital surround sound system for today's audio reproduction. The feasibility of entering the digital surround sound system into the multimedia teaching classroom is analyzed.

Based on data from 156 questionnaires collected from Jinan University and Shanghai Jiaotong University in China, this study adopts an fsQCA approach and concludes that (1) DBA candidates' research self-efficacy stems from all three sets of factors, including learning motivations, learning strategies, and environmental factors. These factors, at either a high level or a low level, combine to generate a number of antecedent configurations; (2) environmental factors, especially mentorship effectiveness and course experience, substantially boost DBA students' research self-efficacy; (3) unlike environmental factors, learning motivations and learning strategies seem to have limited effects on the development of research self-efficacy and act more as contributing conditions than core conditions. This paper makes theoretical contributions to the research fields of both DBA and research self-efficacy.","[Liu, Hui] South China Normal Univ, Sch Educ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Tang, Minhui] Jinan Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China;

With the cost and voltage indexes of the energy storage system of the distribution network as the goal, different optimized configuration schemes are constructed, and the improved HTL-MOPSO algorithm is adopted to find the solution. The results show that compared with the traditional TV-MOPSO algorithm, the proposed algorithm has better convergence performance and optimization ability, and has a lower economic cost.

And to change the type of multiple observations is applied to enhance the effect of control chart. In this thesis, the approach of normalized transformation would be employed to transfer the attribute data become variable data and extend the data type of interval observation. Using the transfer result construct a new control chart, attribute studentized fuzzy interval-valued (ASFIV) chart, with attribute fuzzy interval-valued data which is used to control the shift of quality characteristics for the manufacturing, electrical industry, traditional industry, education science and management fields where quality characteristics include the education score, sales satisfaction, numbers of defective product and so on. The ASFIV chart with interval observation of quality characteristic can point out the variation and degree of shift for the controlled characteristic in various industries. As the interval-valued quality characteristic, to be more specific, is generated which is faster detection the shift than the approach of traditional control chart. Moreover, the numerical studies are used to explain the significant consequent for application of the new ASFIV chart in this study. As such, the studentized fuzzy chart by attribute interval-valued observations could obtain the effective measurement outcome by the attribute data for the practical phenomena and provide related information for decision making of education policy, performance management and sustainable development of industry etc.","[Yang, Chih-Ching] Minnan Normal Univ, Sch Math & Stat, 36 Xian Qian Zhi St, Zhangzhou 363000, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Abdulhay, Enas] Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Irbid, Jordan","Yang, CC (corresponding author), Minnan Normal Univ, Sch Math & Stat, 36 Xian Qian Zhi St, Zhangzhou 363000, Fujian, Peoples R China.",3478978266@qq.com,,,National Social Science Fund of China; Institute of Meteorological Big Data-Digital Fujian; Fujian Key Laboratory of Data Science and Statistics,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China; the Institute of Meteorological Big Data-Digital Fujian and Fujian Key Laboratory of Data Science and Statistics.","Bezerra EL, 2018, INT J PROD ECON, V195, P287, DOI 10.1016/j.ijpe.2017.10.02; Cheng YT, 2014, MANAGE DECIS, V52, P1245, DOI 10.1108/MD-11-2012-078; Cheng YT, 2013, COMMUN STAT-SIMUL C, V42, P534, DOI 10.1080/03610918.2011.64922; Darestani SA, 2016, INT J QUAL RELIAB MA, V33, P2, DOI 10.1108/IJQRM-08-2013-013; Darestani SA, 2014, INT J QUAL RELIAB MA, V31, P811, DOI 10.1108/IJQRM-03-2013-004; Erginel N, 2018, SOFT COMPUT, V22, P5033, DOI 10.1007/s00500-018-3238-; Fadaei Somayeh, 2018, TQM Journal, V30, P232, DOI 10.1108/TQM-10-2017-011; Haridy S, 2014, INT J PROD RES, V52, P3366, DOI 10.1080/00207543.2013.87523; Ho LL, 2013, INT J PROD ECON, V145, P263, DOI 10.1016/j.ijpe.2013.04.04; Kaya I, 2017, APPL SOFT COMPUT, V51, P370, DOI 10.1016/j.asoc.2016.11.04; Leoni RC, 2018, COMPUT IND ENG, V122, P273, DOI 10.1016/j.cie.2018.06.00; Long-Hui Chen, 2016, Journal of Applied Sciences, V16, P201, DOI 10.3923/jas.2016.201.20; QUESENBERRY CP, 1995, J QUAL TECHNOL, V27, P304, DOI 10.1080/00224065.1995.1197961; Wibawati, 2018, J PHYS CONF SER, V1028, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1028/1/01212; Wu BL, 2007, JPN J IND APPL MATH, V24, P197, DOI 10.1007/BF0316753; Yang CC., 2012, INT J INTELL TECHNOL, V5, P10; Yang CC, 2016, J BUS RES, V69, P2138, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.12.02; Yang CC, 2013, SERV IND J, V33, P652, DOI 10.1080/02642069.2011.61434",18,0,0,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The probability of an explosion caused by gas accumulation under different conditions is obtained from statistics of gas explosion accidents. The explosion equivalent and shock wave overpressure are estimated by using field gas data. The data sets of different types of gas explosions and their corresponding density distribution functions are established. The EM algorithm is used for iterative calculation, and the optimal distribution of each gas explosion data set is obtained. The parameters are built according to a posteriori optimization. A state transition matrix is used to achieve numerical inversion of the overpressure of an MCMC gas explosion shock wave. The inversion results are based on the actual conditions of the mine. On the premise of improving the accuracy of the random simulation, the overpressure value of shock wave is more in line with the law of disaster change, which provides theoretical support for safety protection during a disaster.","[Zhang, Jiayong; Ai, Zibo; Guo, Liwen; Cui, Xiao] North China Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Min Engn, Tangshan, Peoples R China; [Gong, Xuemin] North China Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Chem Engn, Tangshan, Peoples R China","Ai, ZB (corresponding author), North China Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Min Engn, Tangshan, Peoples R China.;Gong, XM (corresponding author), North China Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Chem Engn, Tangshan, Peoples R China.",1256681979@qq.com; gongxm1212@163.com,,,National Key Research and Development Plan [2018YFC0808100]; National Natural Science Foundation Fund [51874012],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by National Key Research and Development Plan, grant number 2018YFC0808100, and National Natural Science Foundation Fund, grant number 51874012.","Almutairi A, 2016, ELECTR POW SYST RES, V133, P63, DOI 10.1016/j.epsr.2015.12.01; Dachanuwattana S, 2018, FUEL, V220, P490, DOI 10.1016/j.fuel.2018.02.01; Dovonon P, 2017, J ECONOMETRICS, V201, P43, DOI 10.1016/j.jeconom.2017.06.02; Hubin A, 2018, COMPUT STAT DATA AN, V127, P281, DOI 10.1016/j.csda.2018.05.02; Karakus O, 2017, SIGNAL PROCESS, V141, P125, DOI 10.1016/j.sigpro.2017.05.03; Lee M, 2015, TRANSPORT RES B-METH, V81, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.trb.2015.08.00; Li ZB, 2019, INT J CRIT INFR PROT, V27, DOI 10.1016/j.ijcip.2019.10032; Liu C, 2019, PATTERN RECOGN, V87, P269, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2018.10.02; Lu YK, 2019, ENERG BUILDINGS, V190, P49, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.02.01; Martino L, 2018, DIGIT SIGNAL PROCESS, V82, P133, DOI 10.1016/j.dsp.2018.07.00; Perez CJ, 2006, RELIAB ENG SYST SAFE, V91, P1310, DOI 10.1016/j.ress.2005.11.02; Qin RD, 2018, J NAT GAS SCI ENG, V55, P431, DOI 10.1016/j.jngse.2018.04.03; Qiu L, 2019, MECH SYST SIGNAL PR, V126, P281, DOI 10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.01.03; Rehman MJU, 2019, SIGNAL PROCESS, V160, P32, DOI 10.1016/j.sigpro.2019.02.02; Suo X., 2018, CAUSATION ANAL METH; Vu TK, 2019, ICT EXPRESS, V5, P120, DOI 10.1016/j.icte.2018.08.00; Wu D, 2019, NEUROCOMPUTING, V331, P366, DOI 10.1016/j.neucom.2018.11.04; Xing YZ., 2007, STUDY HEAVY DISASTE; Zhang LA, 2018, COMPUT CHEM ENG, V110, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.compchemeng.2017.11.01",19,0,0,4,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In this paper, we proposed an improved YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) applied Duplex FPN, which enhanced large object detection by utilizing low-level feature information. The conventional YOLOv3 improved the small object detection performance by applying FPN (Feature Pyramid Networks) structure to YOLOv2. However, YOLOv3 with an FPN structure specialized in detecting small objects, so it is difficult to detect large objects. Therefore, this paper proposed an improved YOLOv3 applied Duplex FPN, which can utilize low-level location information in high-level feature maps instead of the existing FPN structure of YOLOv3. This improved the detection accuracy of large objects. Also, an extra detection layer was added to the top-level feature map to prevent failure of detection of parts of large objects. Further, dimension clusters of each detection layer were reassigned to learn quickly how to accurately detect objects. The proposed method was compared and analyzed in the PASCAL VOC dataset. The experimental results showed that the bounding box accuracy of large objects improved owing to the Duplex FPN and extra detection layer, and the proposed method succeeded in detecting large objects that the existing YOLOv3 did not.","[Shin, Seokyong] Kwangwoon Univ, Dept Plasma Bio Display, Seoul, South Korea; [Han, Hyunho] Univ Ulsan, Coll Gen Educ, Ulsan, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Hun] Kwangwoon Univ, Ingenium Coll Liberal Arts, Seoul, South Korea","Lee, SH (corresponding author), Kwangwoon Univ, Ingenium Coll Liberal Arts, Seoul, South Korea.",leesh58@kw.ac.kr,,"Shin, Seokyong/0000-0002-6409-4312",Kwangwoon University,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The present research has been conducted by the Research Grant of Kwangwoon University in 2020.","Bochkovskiy A., 2020, YOLOV4 OPTIMAL SPEE; Everingham M, 2010, INT J COMPUT VISION, V88, P303, DOI 10.1007/s11263-009-0275-; Girshick R.

Due to the rapid development of computer technology, big changes have happened in people's way of life. Accordingly, along with the network technology and the computer technology development, the teaching method also develops rapidly. From the initial projection technology to the current multimedia classroom, microphone audio screen is available. At present, most online teaching platforms provide students with a unified teaching process, and cannot provide corresponding learning resources according to the different characteristics of learners. In order to ameliorate the efficiency of educational information, it is necessary to arouse the enthusiasm of students in the process of learning, and a variety of multimedia network learning platforms begin to be established. English euphemism is also very important in English teaching, which can improve teachers' teaching level, and secondly, improve students' oral English communication level. In this paper, a network teaching system embedded in English euphemism database is proposed to provide more convenience and resources for teachers and students to learn English. Through the technology of network, database and so on, the design of the network teaching platform is realized successfully. Finally, through the actual test and investigation, the utility of the system is fully affirmed. The application of English euphemism teaching in multimedia has a very profound foundation.","[Zhai, Zhongwei] Henan Polytech Univ, Sch Foreign Studies, Jiaozuo 454003, Henan, Peoples R China","Zhai, ZW (corresponding author), Henan Polytech Univ, Sch Foreign Studies, Jiaozuo 454003, Henan, Peoples R China.",zzw@hpu.edu.cn,,,,,"An L, 2017, CAMPUS ENGLISH, P15; Chen CR, 2014, INT J PHOTOENERGY, V2014, DOI 10.1155/2014/92537; Chen J, 2017, PROSPECT SCI TECHNOL, V27, P16; Collins A, 2018, PALLIATIVE MED, V32, P133, DOI 10.1177/026921631773524; Dias SB, 2017, COMPUT EDUC, V107, P127, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2017.01.00; Hartman H, 2018, COMPUT EDUC, V125, P202, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2018.06.01; Huang C., 2019, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, P; Indah KAT, 2018, J PHYS C SER, P95; Klein R, 2017, IEEE IMAGE PROC, P2856, DOI 10.1109/ICIP.2017.829680; Luan X, 2017, INT C SMART GRID E; Moran K.

The serious problems of students' physical health level is still the obvious short board of students' quality,(vertical bar)poor eyesight and physical health level are still the short board of students' quality have not been overcome and solved.(2) It is of great significance to study the birth and development mechanism of students' short physical health level for enhancing students' physical fitness and promoting the healthy development of teenagers. According to the idea that the connection between causes and results is the connection between things or phenomena, the retrospective perspective based on the Triple independent teaching mode of sports and the experience and practice beyond point and level are adopted. Based on the characteristics of Triple independent teaching mode and the problems existing in the implementation of Triple independent teaching mode and the countermeasures to solve the problems, two explanatory variables of Triple independent freedom and project diversity of students are extracted. Through the analysis of the two explanatory variables caused by the qualitative comparative analysis method, it is concluded that the main position of Triple independent of students is the effective condition configuration that causes the short board of students' physical health level. The results show that the contradiction between the students' independent choice of curriculum content and the setting of sports events, the contradiction between the students' independent choice of teachers and PE teachers are the main contradiction of the Triple independent Teaching mode and the root of the defect of the Triple independent Teaching mode. The crux of the teaching reform of Triple independent lies in the understanding and interpretation of the subject status of students' Triple independent. The teaching mode of Triple independent in physical education is to teach students in the main position of Triple independent. The virtual teaching objectives and the lack of depth in teaching are the reasons for the short physical health level of students. The teaching reform of Triple independent in Physical Education in Colleges and universities, whose form is greater than content, is the reform of teaching methods, not the reform of teaching content.","[Xilin, Liu] Wuhan Polytech, Sports Dept, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China","Xilin, L (corresponding author), Wuhan Polytech, Sports Dept, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",67983901@qq.com,,,,,"[Anonymous], OPINIONS STRENGTHEN; Baosheng C., 2020, 2019 NAT ED ; Belagra M, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P293, DOI 10.1177/002072091877305; Hongxia M, 2010, J PHYS ED, V17, P7; Jian W, 2010, ED OCCUP, P12; Jiong L., 2009, SPORTS CULT GUIDE, P7; Lanjia M., 2005, J BEIJING U PHYS ED, V28, P66; LeBoeuf RL, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P155, DOI 10.1177/002072091875625; Quennerstedt M, 2019, SPORT EDUC SOC, V24, P611, DOI 10.1080/13573322.2019.157473; Salehi S, 2019, PHYS REV PHYS EDUC R, V15, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.15.02011; Song X., 2009, J CHENGDU I PHYS ED, V35, P8; Tao W, 2009, J HENAN ED I NAT SCI, V18, P8; Wanlin X, 2016, J XIAN I PHYS ED, V33, P25; Xianjun J, 2010, J ANHUI NORMAL U NAT, V33, P50; Xilin L, 2011, J WUHAN POLYTECH, V10, P6; Yeshou X., 2013, J NANJING I PHYS ED, V27, P7; Zhang Y, 2018, CONT SPORTS SCI TECH, P13; Zhu Z, 2019, SPORTS, P5; Zili L, 2008, PHYS ED SCI, V29, P9",19,0,0,1,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The focus of this paper is twofold; first, highlighting a specific project from a teaching perspective for the design and implementation of a multipurpose experimental test facility for plug-in electric vehicle, renewable energy and energy storage management in the smart grid context. Second, proposing the application of this project as an interactive tool to assist in demonstrating the system behaviour, when teaching the new emerging subjects in power engineering courses particularly, Smart Grid. Indeed, the scope of the test facility with the developed simulation tool is specially structured and oriented to education, training and research studies, where problem-based learning can be easily implemented. The electrical test hardware in this design can be operated independently as a multipurpose experimental setup for plug-in electric vehicle. In addition, it can also be interconnected with a small size wind or photovoltaic system to facilitate a complete hybrid integrated platform for testing and model verification. A variety of illustrative examples are presented to show the features of the test facility with its operation and how the components of this facility were selected. Additionally, several test scenarios are depicted using the developed simulation tool, which cover the assessment of grid integration with its components in the event of unforeseen circumstances. A recommendation that can be drawn from this paper is to motivate academics who are actively involved in conducting research on smart grid, to make use of their hardware or software designs in the process of teaching and learning so that undergraduate students can get the opportunity of observation and experimentation. In this sense, suggestions for future work are proposed.","[Haidar, Ahmed M. A.] Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Haidar, Ahmed M.

In this paper, an accurate fuzzy inference system scheme which provides fault location results for cross-country faults is presented. The fault information from single end of the parallel transmission line is used. A 400 kV, parallel transmission line is designed in MATLAB while fuzzy inference system scheme is modeled with Fuzzy Logic Toolbox. A MAMDANI type of fuzzy inference system with triangular member functions is modeled for attaining the fault distance. The fault information in voltages and currents is captured. Then, the impedances in each phase is computed and given as input to fuzzy inference system which aims to locate the faulty location. The simulation results attest that it is able to precisely locate faults in transmission lines without justifying the classification. The results are also compared with existing fault-location methods to describe salient features of fuzzy inference system scheme.","[Naresh Kumar, A.] Inst Aeronaut Engn, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Hyderabad, India; [Naresh Kumar, A.] GITAM Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Hyderabad, India; [Sanjay, Ch] GITAM Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Hyderabad, India; [Chakravarthy, M.] Vasavi Coll Engn, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Hyderabad, India","Kumar, AN (corresponding author), Inst Aeronaut Engn, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Hyderabad, India.",ankamnaresh29@gmail.com,"Muktevi, Chakravarthy/AGJ-3133-2022; Kumar, A Naresh/AAF-6887-2019","Kumar, A Naresh/0000-0001-6459-0562",,,"AsghariGovar S, 2016, IET GENER TRANSM DIS, V10, P2035, DOI 10.1049/iet-gtd.2015.084; Bi TS, 2012, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V27, P2185, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2012.221074; Chaiwan P, 2014, ELECTR POW SYST RES, V108, P68, DOI 10.1016/j.epsr.2013.11.00; Elkalashy NI, 2016, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V31, P1591, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2015.247263; Jain Anamika, 2010, International Journal of Power and Energy Conversion, V2, P109, DOI 10.1504/IJPEC.2010.03704; Kang N, 2013, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V28, P1040, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2013.224658; Koley E, 2015, INT T ELECTR ENERGY, V25, P1257, DOI 10.1002/etep.190; Kumar AN, 2018, INT J COMPUT INT SYS, V11, P757, DOI 10.2991/ijcis.11.1.5; Meyur R., 2016, IEEE INT C POW EL D; Naresh Kumar A., 2018, J ADV RES DYN CONTRO, V10, P34; Peter E., 2014, EFFECT HIGH FAULT C; Singh S, 2018, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V125, P427, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2017.12.05; Swetapadma A, 2016, INT J ELEC POWER, V81, P254, DOI 10.1016/j.ijepes.2016.02.03; Swetapadma A, 2016, ADV INTELL SYST, V434, P445, DOI 10.1007/978-81-322-2752-6_4; Swetapadma A, 2015, COMPUT INTEL NEUROSC, V2015, DOI 10.1155/2015/62036; Swetapadma A, 2015, ELECTR POW SYST RES, V123, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.epsr.2015.01.01; Wang A., 2008, T TIANJIN U, V14, P23; Wu RD, 2016, ASIA-PAC POWER ENERG, P1486, DOI 10.1109/APPEEC.2016.777973; Xu ZY, 2011, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V26, P2486, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2011.215845; Yadav A, 2015, IET GENER TRANSM DIS, V9, P580, DOI 10.1049/iet-gtd.2014.049; Yalcin MA., 1999, ABSTRACT RECORD; Zin AAM., 2012, 6 AS MOD S BAL IND ",22,37,38,11,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In this case, the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) based wind energy conversion systems are expected to be more beneficial. Provision of power quality improvement such as Harmonic Reduction is the basic key to obtain higher utilization of wind energy. This functionality for future systems leads to lower energy cost, and reliable power system. To incorporate the advanced features, a five level cascaded H - bridge inverter, with reduced number of power electronic switches is progressed in this study, that is configured within the renewable source systems such as solar and wind. The study is carried out on a 10 KW PMSG based wind energy conversion system interfaced to grid. The proposed concept is elucidated through modelling, simulating and analysing in MATLAB/Simulink environment.","[Saranya, K.; Devi Shree, J.] Coimbatore Inst Technol, Elect & Elect Engn Dept, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India","Saranya, K (corresponding author), Coimbatore Inst Technol, Elect & Elect Engn Dept, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.",sarakaran10@gmail.com,,,,,"Abdel Aleem SHE., 2013, EEENG, V6, P6; Agrawal R, 2017, IET RENEW POWER GEN, V11, P1822, DOI 10.1049/iet-rpg.2016.103; Anjali RD., 2015, INT J ENG RES TECHNO, V4, P0; Arif M., 2016, INT C FRONT INF TEC; Behara S, 2018, IET POWER ELECTRON, V11, P708, DOI 10.1049/iet-pel.2017.038; Das MK, 2018, IET RENEW POWER GEN, V12, P252, DOI 10.1049/iet-rpg.2016.089; Earnest J., 2015, WIND POWER TECHNOLO; Gandomi AA, 2015, IET POWER ELECTRON, V8, P1875, DOI 10.1049/iet-pel.2014.076; Hemakesavulu O., 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI [10.1177/0020720919848742, DOI 10.1177/0020720919848742; Jana K.C., 2016, IET RENEWABLE POWER, V10, P92; Lakshmi TVVS., 2013, INT C POW EN CONTR ; Milligan M, 2015, IEEE POWER ENERGY M, V13, P78, DOI 10.1109/MPE.2015.246231; Sakar S, 2016, 2016 IEEE 16 INT C E, P; Salomon CP, 2018, ADV ELECTR COMPUT EN, V18, P91, DOI 10.4316/AECE.2018.0401; Sandeep N, 2017, IEEE T POWER ELECTR, V32, P6677, DOI 10.1109/TPEL.2017.268173; Sathik MAJ, 2017, ELECTR POW COMPO SYS, V45, P1001, DOI 10.1080/15325008.2017.131943; Singaravel MMR, 2015, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V62, P4849, DOI 10.1109/TIE.2015.239927; Suresh Y, 2016, ENG SCI TECHNOL, V19, P894, DOI 10.1016/j.jestch.2015.11.00; Vijayalakshmi S., 2021, International Journal of Electrical Engineering Education, V58, P488, DOI 10.1177/002072091982901; Yuvaraja T, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V57, P164, DOI 10.1177/002072091881380",20,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

It was found that the core competencies of EECS students clearly defined the direction of the students' development especially mathematics ability, scientific and engineering knowledge, implementation, design and analysis, self-study, communication, social development and ethics with high degrees of overlap. This also means that, in addition to mathematical logic, EECS students should also have knowledge related to engineering science, implementation ability, communication and cooperation, and social networking ability. Finally, recommendations for cultivating the core competencies of EECS students were proposed in the hope that graduates will acquire the core competencies required by the industry.","[Chang, Jen-Chia; Shih, Hsiao-Fang] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Grad Inst Technol & Vocat Educ, Taipei, Taiwan","Shih, HF (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Grad Inst Technol & Vocat Educ, Taipei, Taiwan.",tch3214@goo.tyai.tyc.edu.tw,"; Chang, Jen-Chia/G-2103-2018","SHIH, HSIAO FANG/0000-0002-2259-452X; Chang, Jen-Chia/0000-0002-7082-6022",,,"Bloom B.S., 1956, TAXONOMY ED OBJECTI; Eaton SJ., 2003, CHEA MONOGRAPH SERI; Ewell PT., 2001, ACCREDITATION STUDE; Goel S, 2006, J INF TECHNOL EDUC-R, V5, P2; Holmes G, 2000, HIGH EDUC, V40, P247, DOI 10.1023/A:100400303219; Krathwohl D, 1964, TAXONOMY ED OBJECTI; Lin MC, 2013, J RES EDUC SCI, V58, P37, DOI 10.6209/JORIES.2013.58(4).0; Ministry of Education, 2019, MOE 2019 POLICY IMP; Olfson M, 2018, AM J PSYCHIAT, V175, P47, DOI [10.1176/appi.ajp.2017.17040413, 10.1176/appi.ajp.2017.17070808; Passow HJ, 2017, J ENG EDUC, V106, P475, DOI 10.1002/jee.2017; Richards E, 2013, MON LABOR RE; Simpson EJ., 1966, CLASSIFICATION ED O; Wang P-C., 2011, DISCUSSION CONTENT P, V32, P3; Wu C-L., 2011, TAIWAN J GEN ED, V7, P; Yang Y-H., 2013, PERFORM STRATEGY RES, V10, P; Yin T-C., 2010, PROJECT INVESTIGATI",16,0,0,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Thus, the power system can continue to operate regularly and sustainably without the need for a sudden interruption of some production units or an unforeseen load increase. For this, the optimum amount of reserves should be kept ready, which is one of the serious resources used by the power system to prevent fundamentally unpredictable failures. In this study, while the unit is being allocated, three parameters will be considered in determining the optimum reserve amount, which are the units with production costs, line losses, and reliability. In the system used as 22 Bus, each of these three impressive factors was analysed for the appropriate spinning reserve cost by adding an account and compared with eight different case studies. As a result of the calculations, the most reasonable cost of the result, in which line losses have a very low effect, evaluated in terms of production cost and reliability. As a result, when the reserve is allocated to the units in power systems, the right policy for the most appropriate planning is proposed to ensure sustainable and uninterrupted electricity.","[Tur, Mehmet Rida] Batman Univ, Dept Elect & Energy, Batman, Turkey","Tur, MR (corresponding author), Batman Univ TBMYO, Dept Elect & Energy, TR-72050 Batman, Turkey.",mrida.tur@batman.edu.tr,,,,,"Abdelkader SM, 2007, IET GENER TRANSM DIS, V1, P584, DOI 10.1049/iet-gtd:2006034; Ahmadi-Khatir A, 2011, ELECTR POW SYST RES, V81, P862, DOI 10.1016/j.epsr.2010.11.02; Amanulla B, 2012, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V27, P918, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2011.217995; Armando ML., 2017, IEEE T POWER SYST, V2, P161; Awad ASA, 2014, IEEE T SMART GRID, V5, P2339, DOI 10.1109/TSG.2014.231619; Billinton R, 2011, IEEE T POWER SYST, V26, P2101, DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2011.213817; Bruninx K, 2017, IEEE T POWER SYST, V32, P2593, DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2016.262126; Carcamo-Gallardo A, 2009, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V24, P328, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2008.92399; Chattopadbyay D, 2002, 2002 IEEE POWER ENGINEERING SOCIETY WINTER MEETING, VOLS 1 AND 2, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, P280, DOI 10.1109/PESW.2002.98499; Chen CS, 2006, IEEE T POWER SYST, V21, P1209, DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2006.87667; Chia-Mei Chen, 2014, 2014 International Conference on Trustworthy Systems and their Applications, P1, DOI 10.1109/TSA.2014.1; Chiradeja P, 2004, IEEE T ENERGY CONVER, V19, P764, DOI 10.1109/TEC.2004.82770; Das D, 2006, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V21, P202, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2005.85233; Deveikis T, 2013, ELEKTRON ELEKTROTECH, V19, P21, DOI 10.5755/j01.eee.19.10.272; Diaaeldin I, 2019, ENERGIES, V12, DOI 10.3390/en1221417; Falaghi H, 2009, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V24, P268, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2008.200565; Gopalakrishnan R, 2013, SADHANA-ACAD P ENG S, V38, P545, DOI 10.1007/s12046-013-0153-; Grigg C, 1999, IEEE T POWER SYST, V14, P1010, DOI 10.1109/59.78091; Hossain E, 2018, IEEE ACCESS, V6, P16816, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2018.281498; Hu B, 2015, J ELECTR ENG TECHNOL, V10, P1422, DOI 10.5370/JEET.2015.10.4.142; Jeon YJ, 2002, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V17, P1070, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2002.80382; Jeong YW, 2009, J ELECTR ENG TECHNOL, V4, P32; Jo KH, 2018, ENERGIES, V11, DOI 10.3390/en1104074; Lannoye E, 2015, IEEE T POWER SYST, V30, P57, DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2014.232179; Liu ZY, 2020, ENERGIES, V13, DOI 10.3390/en1302044; Longlong L., 2013, ENERGY POWER ENG, V5, P101; Madrigal M., 2000, IEEE Power Engineering Review, V20, P52, DOI 10.1109/39.86687; Moradi A, 2008, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V23, P271, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2007.90542; Mostafa MH, 2020, J ENERGY STORAGE, V29, DOI 10.1016/j.est.2020.10134; Padhy NP, 2004, IEEE T POWER SYST, V19, P1196, DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2003.82161; Prasad K, 2005, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V20, P1211, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2005.84424; RAGHAVENDRA CS, 1987, SADHANA-ACAD P ENG S, V11, P111, DOI 10.1007/BF0281131; Rizk-Allah R.M., 2017, INT J ENERGY CONVERS, V5, P180, DOI [10.15866/irecon.v5i6.14291, DOI 10.15866/IRECON.V5I6.14291; Salazar H, 2006, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V21, P1735, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2006.87585; Savier JS, 2007, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V22, P2473, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2007.90537; Shahidehpour M, 2002, MARKET OPERATIONS E; Shayesteh E, 2010, ENERGY, V35, P1908, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2010.01.00; Tur MR, 2020, IEEE ACCESS, V8, P77962, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.299034; Tur MR, 2019, J FAC ENG ARCHIT GAZ, V34, P1172, DOI 10.17341/gazimmfd.46051; Tur MR, 2017, INT J RENEW ENERGY R, V7, P94; Tur MR., 2020, IEEE ACCESS, V202; Wu H, 1999, IEEE POWER ENGINEERING SOCIETY - 1999 WINTER MEETING, VOLS 1 AND 2, P785, DOI 10.1109/PESW.1999.74726; Wu ZL, 2017, CSEE J POWER ENERGY, V3, P203, DOI 10.17775/CSEEJPES.2017.002; Zhao B, 2006, INT J ELEC POWER, V28, P482, DOI 10.1016/j.ijepes.2006.02.01",44,0,0,13,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Resultant wave-shapes may not be accurate and determined values of different parameters may not be exact. Due to inaccurate outcomes and time-consuming process in a conventional way, researchers despond to continue their approach. In this paper, a trainer kit has been developed which is just like a laboratory with necessary components and aims to implement multivibrators (Bistable, Monostable, and Astable) and RC phase shift oscillators in the laboratory. A variable power supply is constructed in the trainer kit that provides 9 V dc to the multivibrators and 15 V dc to the oscillator. Potentiometer, voltage regulator, different active and passive components such as resistors, capacitor, op-amp, transistor, and numerous jumper wires are introduced in this kit. The trainer kit ascertains an easy implementation by eliminating complexity and assures accurate wave-shapes at the oscilloscope within a short time. To validate the proposed system, a survey program has been introduced among many students and faculty members. The outcome of the survey is the demonstration of student and instructor views and opinions which acknowledges the trainer kit as an efficient and compatible working platform.","[Podder, Amit Kumer; Islam, Sayemul; Rahman, Asif Ur] Khulna Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Khulna 9203, Bangladesh","Podder, AK (corresponding author), Khulna Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Khulna 9203, Bangladesh.",amit@eee.kuet.ac.bd,"Podder, Amit Kumer/AAA-3885-2021","Podder, Amit Kumer/0000-0002-3053-7680; Islam, Sayemul/0000-0002-0559-5096",,,"Abidin AFZ, 2018, ARPN J ENG APPL SCI, V13, P407; Ajao, 2017, J ENG TECHNOLOGY, V8, P3; Alasdoon A, 2013, LECT NOTES ENG COMP, VI, P18; Ali, 2018, AM J EMBEDDED SYSTEM, V6, P1; [Anonymous], 2018, TELKOMNIK; Anugrah D., 2019, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, V1413, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1413/1/01200; Bamgboye OO, 2014, INT J INNOVATION SCI, V2, P4; Brylow D., 2007, P 2007 WORKSH COMP A, P44, DOI 10.1145/1275633.127564; Fuada S., 2016, INDONES J ELECT ENG, V1, DOI [10.11591/ijeecs.v1.i1.pp88-100, DOI 10.11591/IJEECS.V1.I1.PP88-100; Guruswamy G, 2003, INT C POWER ELECT DR, P104; Hacker C., 2009, P AAEE, P; Hamid M.

WBAN is a collection of pieces of tiny wireless body sensors with small computational capability and communicates short distance using ZigBee or Bluetooth. The main application of WBAN is in healthcare industry like remote patient monitoring. The small pieces of sensor monitor health factors like body temperature, pulse rate, ECG, heart rate etc., and communicate it to the base station or central coordinator for aggregation or for data computation. The final data is communicated to remote monitoring devices through internet or cloud service providers. The main challenge of this technology is dead nodes due to high energy consumption with all the wireless node working on battery. Minimization of the energy consumption extends life of the network. Security is another major challenge. There are possibilities of internal attacks being executed by malicious nodes, creating problems for the network. This paper proposes a model which provides solution for extending the life span of the network by minimizing energy consumption and also proposes model to provide solution for internal soft attacks created within the network through calculation or trust, computation among nodes to identify malicious nodes with the help of social-and QoS-based trust computation for secure clustering and communication. The proposed model is compared with LEACH and LEACH-MM protocol and performance is measured with various parameters.","[Ramaswamy, Sangeetha; Norman, Jasmine] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Informat Technol & Engn, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India","Ramaswamy, S (corresponding author), VIT Univ, Vellore Inst Technol, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India.",sangeemathi2012@gmail.com,,,,,"Alshehri MD, 2018, MOBILE NETW APPL, V23, P419, DOI 10.1007/s11036-018-1017-; Altaf A, 2019, J NETW COMPUT APPL, V137, P93, DOI 10.1016/j.jnca.2019.02.02; Anguraj DK, 2019, WIRELESS PERS COMMUN, V104, P1, DOI 10.1007/s11277-018-6005-; Asha G, 2019, SOFT COMPUT, V23, P2537, DOI 10.1007/s00500-018-03704-; Aslam M., 2013, ARXIV1309437; Babu S.

One such approach is the UPCT-Bloopbusters educational project, developed by a group of professors at the Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena (UPCT), Spain, wherein concepts from the fields of physics and technology are presented and exemplified in the classroom through scenes from different movies in conjunction with experiments. The project was conducted on three subjects, one from each of the three bachelor of electrical engineering degree programs offered at the UPCT, namely Physics I, Applied Physics, and Optical Communications. This paper describes the methodology of the educational project and then presents and discusses the academic results of the students involved in terms of success and performance rates both before and after the application of the new methodology. Moreover, the results of a survey carried out on the students are presented. Finally, some of the exercises used in this methodology for the teaching and learning of science based on different movie scenes are provided as examples. The results of the project show that the students were receptive of the methodology and further indicated that it may lead to increased academic performance due to their enhanced understanding of physics and technology concepts.","[Rodriguez, Jose-Victor] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Informat Technol & Commun, Plaza Hosp 1, Cartagena 30202, Spain; [Sanchez-Perez, Juan-Francisco; Castro-Rodriguez, Enrique] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Appl Phys, Cartagena, Colombia; [Serrano-Martinez, Jose-Luis] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Cartagena, Spain","Rodriguez, JV (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Informat Technol & Commun, Plaza Hosp 1, Cartagena 30202, Spain.",jvictor.rodriguez@upct.es,"Serrano Martínez, José Luis/K-3637-2014; Perez, Juan Francisco Sanchez/ABF-6333-2020","Serrano Martínez, José Luis/0000-0002-6545-9395; Castro, Enrique/0000-0001-7477-9414","Fundacion Espanola para la Ciencia y la Tecnologia (FECYT) [FCT-16-10854, FCT-17-12846, FCT-18-13460]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors would like to thank Fundacion Espanola para la Ciencia y la Tecnologia (FECYT) for partial funding through the projects FCT-16-10854, FCT-17-12846 and FCT-18-13460.","Asimov I., 1968, PHYS TEACH, V6, P41; Barnett M., 2006, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V15, P179, DOI DOI 10.1007/S10956-006-9001-; Berne Rosalyn W., 2005, B SCI TECHNOL SOC, V25, P45; Bixler A, 2007, AM BIOL TEACH, V69, P337, DOI 10.1662/0002-7685(2007)69[337:TEWTAO]2.0.CO;; Blasco P., 2011, CREATIVE ED, V02, P174, DOI DOI 10.4236/CE.2011.2302; Blasco Pablo G, 2010, Fam Med, V42, P2; Bybee RW., 2008, TEACHING 2 SCH SCI S, V9th e; Cavelos J., 1999, SCI STAR WAR; Chiappetta EL., 2006, SCI INSTRUCTION MIDD, V6th ed; Daley B., 2004, PHYS TEACH, V42, P4; Dark ML., 2005, PHYS TEACH, V43, P46; De Castella K, 2013, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V105, P861, DOI 10.1037/a003246; Dennis MC., 2002, PHYS TEACH, V40, P42; Everitt LR., 1999, PHYS TEACH, V37, P51; Fraknoi A, 2002, ASTRON ED REV, V1, P11; Frieden JA., 2007, TEACHER LIB, V34, P6; Henry KL, 2012, J YOUTH ADOLESCENCE, V41, P156, DOI 10.1007/s10964-011-9665-; Johnstone A.

This co-ordinated control strategy greatly maintains the autonomous hybrid power system voltage deviation by adjusting the reactive power imbalance caused due to the impulsive reactive power nature of DFIG coupled with the DSTS and load. Gain values of Integral Order Proportional Integral (IO-PI) controller in LSC and AVR are optimized to maintain the system voltage stability. Modern and simple Grey wolf optimization algorithm has been used to extract the superior PI gain values to maintain system stability with less reaction time. The proposed co-ordinated control strategy has been tested with various load disturbance and with dynamic input power feed from DSTS to validate the system robustness. Also, the optimized gain value based voltage deviation values are validated in real time with dSPACE.","[Mynavathi, M.; Devi Shree, J.; Saranya, K.] Coimbatore Inst Technol, Dept EEE, Coimbatore 641014, Tamil Nadu, India","Mynavathi, M (corresponding author), Coimbatore Inst Technol, Dept EEE, Coimbatore 641014, Tamil Nadu, India.",mynavathieee@gmail.com,,,,,"Aidoo IK, 2016, INT J ELEC POWER, V81, P387, DOI 10.1016/j.ijepes.2016.02.02; Anantwar H., 2019, OPTIMIZED CONTROL V; Anantwar H, 2017, ENRGY PROCED, V117, P409, DOI 10.1016/j.egypro.2017.05.16; [Anonymous], Annual Report 2017-201; [Anonymous], DSPACE DS1104 TECHN; Babu NR, 2019, IET RENEW POWER GEN, V13, P2221, DOI 10.1049/iet-rpg.2018.608; Bansal RC, 2006, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V53, P1116, DOI 10.1109/TIE.2006.87832; Bhatti TS, 2014, 2014 RECENT ADVANCES AND INNOVATIONS IN ENGINEERING (ICRAIE; Guha D, 2016, ENG SCI TECHNOL, V19, P1693, DOI 10.1016/j.jestch.2016.07.00; Hussain I, 2017, IET RENEW POWER GEN, V11, P750, DOI 10.1049/iet-rpg.2016.057; Ibrahim RA, 2018, EXPERT SYST APPL, V108, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2018.04.02; Kongtragool B, 2003, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V7, P131, DOI 10.1016/S1364-0321(02)00053-; Kundur P, 2004, IEEE T POWER SYST, V19, P1387, DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2004.82598; Mohanty A, 2016, J OCEAN ENG SCI, V1, P256, DOI 10.1016/j.joes.2016.06.00; Mohanty A, 2016, INT J ELEC POWER, V78, P524, DOI 10.1016/j.ijepes.2015.12.00; Ozdemir MT, 2017, ENERGIES, V10, DOI 10.3390/en1012213; Pradhan M, 2018, AIN SHAMS ENG J, V9, P2015, DOI 10.1016/j.asej.2016.08.02; PrasadBagarty D., 2019, INT J ELECT ENG ED, V2, P; Shakarami MR, 2016, ELECTR POW SYST RES, V133, P149, DOI 10.1016/j.epsr.2015.12.01; Sharma P., 2011, THESIS INDIAN I TEC; Sharma P, 2012, EUR T ELECTR POWER, V22, P351, DOI 10.1002/etep.56; Wu SY, 2010, APPL ENERG, V87, P452, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2009.08.04; Yadav DK, 2014, INT J ELEC POWER, V62, P507, DOI 10.1016/j.ijepes.2014.04.06",23,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This platform facilitates the students throughout teaching the course in learning the essential concepts of control systems such as modeling, stability analysis, and skill of designing controllers for the dynamic systems. The participants of the course identify the transfer function of the robot and compare it with the transfer function developed by using laws of physics. The students, then compare the identified model with the mathematical model by using stability analysis techniques, finding out that the stability range is much smaller for the experimental model than the mathematical model. After that, several types of controllers are designed and tested on the experimental model and EV3 robots, which demonstrates that there exists discrepancies between conceptual and practical designs. Finally, a comparison of students' apprehension of a set of capabilities before and after taking the course shows the value of using EV3 robots on improving students' learning experiences of control systems course.","[Zhang, Meirong] Gonzaga Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Spokane, WA 99258 USA; [Wan, Yan] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Elect Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA","Zhang, MR (corresponding author), Gonzaga Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Spokane, WA 99258 USA.",zhangm@gonzaga.edu,,,NSF [CAREER-1714519],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Wan would like to thank NSF CAREER-1714519 for the support of this work.","Barnes D.

Such courses are either completely free or cost nominally. Generally, the MOOCs face the challenge of not being recognized as 'regular' courses (i.e., the ones taken at the traditional learning institutions). One of the main reasons for this lack of acceptability is the assessment in an unsupervised environment, which is prone to the problems of test-taker's online lookups or interaction with others for finding the answers to the test questions. A few ways of alleviating this problem include: limiting the time for answering the questions, the avoidance of repetitive questions, and the creation of a large number of questions. This paper presents a tool named QAgen that enables the automatic creation of a large number of questions and answers related to different topics in computer/electrical engineering (ECE), computer science, physics, etc. Specifically, the tool is related to the courses on digital logic design, computer architecture, etc. The generated questions are in a format that is suitable both for learning management system (LMS) based and/or non-LMS-based assessment in conventional courses or MOOCs. The proposed tool is based on open-source software, thus eliminating the need for any commercial software packages. The underlying principles of QAgen are applicable to other engineering/science courses as well, if the assessment methods require the creation of some connected-object diagrams, tables and equations. For assessing the usefulness of QAgen, practice question sets were created for three different courses. The student surveys for these courses indicated that the questions helped students prepare for actual tests/examinations. Especially favored by the students was the availability of correct answers at the end of each practice test/examination.","[Beg, Azam; Alhemeiri, Mouza] United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Beg, Ajmal] Cortex Business Solut, Calgary, AB, Canada","Beg, A (corresponding author), United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.",abeg@uaeu.ac.ae,,,,,"Ahmed B, 2018, PR IEEE INT CONF TEA, P1142, DOI 10.1109/TALE.2018.861522; Al-Ashmoery Y, 2015, 2015 INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND COMPUTER VISION (ISCV; Aleman E.

Computer vision and machine learning based approaches have gained huge attraction in digital image processing field. Several visual computing based techniques have been presented in the past for early prediction of plant leaf diseases. However, detection accuracy is still considered as a challenging task. Hence, in order to overcome this issue, we introduce a novel hybrid approach carried out in three forms. During the first phase, image enhancement and image conversion scheme are incorporated, which helps to overcome the low-illumination and noise related issues. In the next phase, a combined feature extraction technique is developed by using GLCM, Complex Gabor filter, Curvelet and image moments. Finally, a Neuro-Fuzzy Logic classifier is trained with the extracted features. The proposed approach is implemented using MATLAB simulation tool where PlantVillage Database is considered for analysis. The average detection accuracy has been obtained as more than 90% for 2 test cases which shows that the proposed combination of feature extraction and image pre-processing process is able to obtain improved classification accuracy.

As the sensor nodes have the limited processing power, designing energy efficient image transmission is another challenge in this research. This paper proposed a novel method of cooperative image transformation from the transmitter to the receiver for wireless sensor networks. We designed the methods for multi-hop one-way relayed cooperative communication model for wireless sensor networks. We believe that the cooperative communication helps to improve the efficiency of image transmission. The proposed approach focused on efficient relayed image transmission through wireless channels with optimum image quality and bit error rate performances. First, lightweight image quality improvement method was proposed at both transmitter and receiver end as images captured under various illumination conditions. Second, the proposed compressive sensing was performed using the approximation coefficient of 2D discrete wavelet transform. We utilized the wavelet denoising advantage by presenting the hybrid thresholding function. And third, use of decode-forward method at relay nodes to perform the task of decode and forward received image data block. The compressed approximation component of 2D discrete wavelet Transform is further used to apply inverse fast Fourier transform and then in modulation using quadrature phase shift keying to transmit over additive white Gaussian noise channel to relay nodes as per the standard orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing model. The simulation results claim the performance efficiency against the state-of-art methods based on mean square error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and bit error rate.","[Al-Hayani, Bilal; Ilhan, Haci] Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, TR-34217 Istanbul, Turkey","Al-Hayani, B (corresponding author), Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, TR-34217 Istanbul, Turkey.",bilalalhayanil@gmail.com,"Ilhan, Haci/ABA-1968-2020; Alhayani, Bilal/AAM-1142-2020","Alhayani, Bilal/0000-0001-9309-3573",,,"Aghdasi Hadi S, 2008, 2008 4th International Conference on Circuits and Systems for Communications, P838, DOI 10.1109/ICCSC.2008.18; Aravind BN, 2015, INT C TRENDS AUT COM, P19; Aziz SM, 2016, IEEE COMMUN LETT, V17, P84; Baldoni J, 2016, J STRAIN ANAL ENG, V51, P416, DOI 10.1177/030932471664669; Boluk PS, 2011, MOBILE NETW APPL, V16, P149, DOI 10.1007/s11036-010-0282-; Chan SH, 2011, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V20, P3097, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2011.215822; Goyal VK, 2001, IEEE SIGNAL PROC MAG, V18, P74, DOI 10.1109/79.95280; Grgic M, 2001, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V38, P187, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.38.3.; Gupta V., 2013, P IEEE INT C WIR OPT, P1, DOI 10.1109/WOCN.2013.661623; Kudeshia A, 2014, IEEE SIGNAL PROC LET, V21, P722, DOI 10.1109/LSP.2014.231388; Laneman JN, 2005, IEEE T INFORM THEORY, V51, P3518, DOI 10.1109/TIT.2005.85557; Lecuire Vincent, 2008, International Journal of Sensor Networks, V4, P37, DOI 10.1504/IJSNET.2008.01925; Lecuire V, 2007, EURASIP J IMAGE VIDE, DOI 10.1155/2007/4734; LEUNG CK, 1978, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V15, P203, DOI 10.1177/00207209780150030; Ma T, 2010, C LOCAL COMPUT NETW, P240, DOI 10.1109/LCN.2010.573571; Manhas E.

RLNS in the pitch of large scale integrated circuits, digital signal processing, multimedia, scientific computing and artificial neural network applications have Fixed Width property which has equal number of in and out bit width; hence, these applications need a Fixed Width multiplier. In this paper, a Fixed Width-Floating-Point multiplier based on RLNS was proposed to increase the processing speed. The truncation errors were reduced by using Taylor series. RLNS is the combination of both the residue number system and the logarithmic number system, and uses a table lookup including all bits for expansion. The proposed scheme is effective with regard to speed, area and power utilization in contrast to the design of conservative Floating-Point mathematics designs. Synthesis results were obtained using a Xilinx 14.7 ISE simulator. The area is 16,668 mu m(2), power is 37 mW, delay is 6.160 ns and truncation error can be lessened by 89% as compared with the direct-truncated multiplier. The proposed Fixed Width RLNS multiplier performs with lesser compensation error and with minimal hardware complexity, particularly as multiplier input bits increment.","[Rubia, J. Jency; Kumar, G.

The method proposed in this study reduces this damage. The power state of the generator stage is made equal to the state of the power of the grid in order to prevent the occurrence of a sudden arc. Even if the generator power state is the same with the power state of the generator, an arc can be generated due to a sudden current flow during the transfer. Therefore, the current in the generator stage is controlled to 0 (zero) when transferring, so that the generation of an electrical arc is minimized. In general, when the CTTS system is used for transferring power sources with an emergency generator, the impact from the electrical arc will be momentarily proportional to the amount of the power supplied from the generator to the load. The damage by the arc will make the life of the CTTS system shorter. In order to prevent such damage, a blocking technique using parallel capacitor is constituted. However, this causes arc generation at the time of input. Thus, in this paper, it is proposed to control the effective or ineffective power of the system to zero. To verify the validity of the proposed method, firstly the Powersim simulation was conducted, and after confirming the feasibility based on this, the actual prototype was created and implemented. Zero power control is proposed as a way to improve the stability of CTTS by significantly reducing the generation of an electrical arc. And this technique can help people working on the distributed power or the grid management.","[Seon, Ho-Yun; Yang, Ji-Hoon; Park, Sung-Jun] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Gwang Ju, South Korea; [Lee, Sang-Hun] Dong Eui Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Busan, South Korea; [Park, Seong-Mi] Korea Lift Coll, Dept Lift Engn, Geochang, South Korea","Park, SJ (corresponding author), Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Gwang Ju, South Korea.",sjpark1@jnu.ac.kr,,"Seon, Hoyun/0000-0002-5373-0109",,,"Akhunov FI, 2016, 2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SCIENCE AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES (ICISCT; An QT, 2015, IEEE T POWER ELECTR, V30, P2814, DOI 10.1109/TPEL.2014.236083; Attia HA, 2013, IEEE CONF CLEAN ENER, P265, DOI 10.1109/CEAT.2013.677563; Feng L, 2017, APPL POWER ELECT CO, P384, DOI 10.1109/APEC.2017.793072; Griva G, 2009, 2009 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CLEAN ELECTRICAL POWER (ICCEP 2009), VOLS 1 AND 2, P41; Heo S, 2017, 2017 IEEE 21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PULSED POWER (PPC; Heo S, 2016, IEEE INT POWER MODUL, P417, DOI 10.1109/IPMHVC.2016.801283; Hotchkiss R.

The method combines mathematical and theoretical studies with antenna design and laboratory measurements to reinforce the subject's theoretical and practical aspects together. Topics discussed in lectures include performing antenna radiation calculations, learning how to make antenna radiation pattern measurements, and designing of antennas such as microstrip patch antenna. The education is based on teaching these principles and enabling students to make some antenna measurements. At the end of the semester, an analysis on learning outcomes of the course was performed and feedback from students was taken. The feedback from students showed that there was a huge satisfaction in terms of achieving the goals in learning outcomes. The course structure proposed can be a good example for instructors who teach antennas and propagation courses.","[Ulker, Sadik] European Univ Lefke, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Via Mersin 10, Lefke, North Cyprus, Turkey","Ulker, S (corresponding author), European Univ Lefke, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Via Mersin 10, Lefke, North Cyprus, Turkey.",sulker@eul.edu.tr,,,,,"Anguera J, 2007, 37 ANN FRONT ED C GL, pS2; Aydn E, 2015, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V53, P8; Bachiller C, 2003, IEEE ANTENN PROPAG M, V45, P140, DOI 10.1109/MAP.2003.118966; Balanis CA., 2005, ANTENNA THEORY ANAL, P81; Crilly P., 2014, C AM SOC ENG ED ASE; Dokuz Eylul University, 2016, COURS CAT INF PACK ; EXCELL PS, 1993, IEEE T EDUC, V36, P227, DOI 10.1109/13.21470; Hacettepe University Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, 2016, ELE444 HAC U DEP E; Hammerstad E., 1975, 5th European Microwave Conference, P26; KTH, 2016, EL1210 WAV PROP AN; Mazarakis MG., 2005, P 21 IEEE NPS S FUS, P1, DOI [10.1109/FUSION.2005.252868, DOI 10.1109/FUSION.2005.252868; Mosig J, 2004, MICROELECTRONICS ED, P25; Nagy L., 1993, 23rd European Microwave Conference Proceedings, P1012, DOI 10.1109/EUMA.1993.33681; Oregon State University, 2016, ECE 484 ANT PRO; Posadas VG, 1998, IEEE AP-S, P2280, DOI 10.1109/APS.1998.70176; Pozaw D.

It helps students obtain an overview of the power system, and systematically learn about fundamental theories. However, the traditional teaching of PSA course excessively focuses on the class lecture, and is combined with hardware-based experiments that are restricted due to concerns of security and cost. Enhancing the PSA course has been attempted at Shandong University, China, since 2016, which combines class lecture, laboratory exercises, and practical activities into the daily teaching. In laboratory exercises, project-based learning (PBL) is carried out by using the hardware experimental equipment and self-developed teaching software, VTPCE, hence to enhance students' understandings of knowledge, hands-on abilities, and researching skills. Practical activities are organized by visiting the topic-related institutes to establish the relationships between theories and practices. This paper introduces the architecture, the intended learning objects (ILOs), and the detailed arrangement of the reformed PSA course. The assessment procedures for students are also presented, as well as the satisfaction surveys.","[Wei, Mingjie; Zhang, Hengxu; Fang, Tianyu] Shandong Univ, Key Lab Power Syst Intelligent Dispatch & Control, Minist Educ, 17923 Jingshi Rd, Jinan 250061, Shandong, Peoples R China","Zhang, HX (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Key Lab Power Syst Intelligent Dispatch & Control, Minist Educ, 17923 Jingshi Rd, Jinan 250061, Shandong, Peoples R China.",zhanghx@sdu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Hengxu/A-9055-2008","Zhang, Hengxu/0000-0001-5315-0887",,,"Abdel-Khalik AS, 2016, IEEE T EDUC, V59, P307, DOI 10.1109/TE.2016.255528; Barata PNA, 2015, IEEE T EDUC, V58, P255, DOI 10.1109/TE.2015.239384; Anwar  N., 2013, TECHNOLOGY, V35, P3; Bergen AR., 2009, POWER SYSTEM ANA; Deese AS, 2015, IEEE T POWER SYST, V30, P1279, DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2014.234352; Hosseinzadeh N, 2012, IEEE T EDUC, V55, P495, DOI 10.1109/TE.2012.219158; Hu QR, 2015, IEEE T EDUC, V58, P32, DOI 10.1109/TE.2014.232152; Jin ZS, 2015, 2015 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRIC UTILITY DEREGULATION AND RESTRUCTURING AND POWER TECHNOLOGIES (DRPT 2015), P1373, DOI 10.1109/DRPT.2015.743244; Karmakar S, 2017, IEEE T EDUC, V60, P29, DOI 10.1109/TE.2016.258675; Kotsampopoulos PC, 2017, IEEE T POWER SYST, V32, P3992, DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2016.263320; Meegahapola LG, 2019, IEEE T EDUC, V62, P149, DOI 10.1109/TE.2018.288962; Milano F, 2008, IEEE T EDUC, V51, P17, DOI 10.1109/TE.2007.89335; Niu Z, 2012, EXP SCI TECH, V10, P1; Strasser T, 2014, IEEE T POWER SYST, V29, P1989, DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2014.230574; TAMURA Y, 1990, IEEE T POWER SYST, V5, P492, DOI 10.1109/59.5455; Vanfretti L, 2012, IEEE T EDUC, V55, P309, DOI 10.1109/TE.2011.217221; Wang Q, 2012, ADV MATER RES-KR, V1, P93, DOI 10.12989/amr.2012.1.1.09; Zhang Z, 2016, IEEE T EDUC, V59, P32, DOI 10.1109/TE.2015.242667",18,1,1,3,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

They have a graphical programming language interface resambling the relay panels which they are intended to replace so that the transition from relay panels might be swift and smooth. Although learning this programming language is easy, real life experiments are essential for students to gain greater understanding of the logic behind the language. However, it is generally too expensive to provide an experimental set-up for students to test their theoretical knowledge. For this reason, a conveyor and feeder system was developed as a low cost 3D printable design using a CAD program and implemented for use in a control laboratory. Using this conveyor set-up, students can experience how to program a practical example of a PLC devices used in industry together with an introduction to actuators and sensors. Reading actual sensors and using actuators via the inputs and outputs of a PLC to control a real life system will be far more effective than simulator alternatives.","[Tepe, Cengiz; Eminoglu, Ilyas] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Samsun, Turkey; [Aslan, Abidin Sefa] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Samsun, Turkey","Tepe, C (corresponding author), Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Samsun, Turkey.",cengiztepe1@gmail.com,,"tepe, cengiz/0000-0003-4065-5207",,,"Babchuk WA, 2017, ADULT EDUC QUART, V67, P71, DOI 10.1177/074171361667193; Hossain A, 1997, IEEE IND APPLIC SOC, P906, DOI 10.1109/IAS.1997.62896; Kabadurmus O, 2007, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 1ST RFID EURASIA CONFERENCE, P30; Kataria D, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072092092846; Komol MMR, 2017, 2017 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (EICT 2017; LEVINE PS, 1995, INTECH, V42, P5; Luo Y, 2020, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072092091815; Manesis S, 2003, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V40, P255, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.40.4.; Oladapo BI, 2016, ENG SCI TECHNOL, V19, P1452, DOI 10.1016/j.jestch.2016.04.00; Rullan A, 1997, COMPUT IND ENG, V33, P421, DOI 10.1016/S0360-8352(97)00127-; Sahu R, 2017, 2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SMART TECHNOLOGIES AND MANAGEMENT FOR COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION, CONTROLS, ENERGY AND MATERIALS (ICSTM), P290, DOI 10.1109/ICSTM.2017.808917; Singh AK, 2017, PROCEEDINGS OF 2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CIRCUIT ,POWER AND COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES (ICCPCT; Smeu GA, 2013, 2013 8TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ADVANCED TOPICS IN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING (ATEE), DOI 10.1109/ATEE.2013.656340; Tepe C., 2020, CONVEYOR BELT EXPT ; Xu J, 2018, IEEE INT CONF RFI",15,1,1,6,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Failing and low performed student learning outcomes (SOs) and course learning outcomes (COs) in range of core EE courses were observed to be linked with weak Mathematics basis of students. This feedback was achieved through an automated CQI system in EvalTools under Faculty Class Assessment Report(FCAR) tab, where each instructor is required to make reflections about failing as well as low performed SOs and COs. Feedback was reviewed comprehensively, and mathematical concepts which significantly affect the performance of students in the core EE courses were derived. Moreover, a high level of Mathematics pre-requisite covering required mathematical concepts is identified for the range of core EE courses. Consequently, well-defined tasks were assigned to continuously evaluate and monitor improvement in required Mathematics concepts to ensure SOs and COs achieved in core EE courses. Results are given to exhibit the effectiveness of continuous improvement management system (CIMS).","[Wajid, H.

However, because their own characteristics, the strategic plans in colleges and universities are mostly developed at an institutional level. As these provide an overview of the organization, they cannot be very detailed and may contain a certain amount of ambiguities in order to satisfy its multiple constituencies. At the institutional level there are limited opportunities to include specific strategies that may affect individual academic programs. To solve these limitations, this paper proposes strategic plans being developed and incorporated at the program level, specifically for electrical engineering or electrical engineering technology programs. The appropriate strategic planning results in strengthen these programs and generate useful and significant dialog among their constituencies. The paper finishes by showing a generic strategic plan for an electrical engineering technology program that can nevertheless, be adopted and modified as needed by faculty and academic staff involved in this process of creating a similar plan for their own electrical engineering programs.","[Lozano-Nieto, Albert] Penn State Univ, Wilkes Barre Campus, Lehman, PA 18612 USA","Lozano-Nieto, A (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Wilkes Barre Campus, Lehman, PA 18612 USA.",AXL17@psu.edu,,"Lozano, Albert/0000-0003-3241-012X",,,"Abdallah C, 2014, J MANAGE STUD, V51, P235, DOI 10.1111/joms.1200; ABET, CRIT ACCR ENG TECH; Allison M., 2015, STRATEGIC PLANNING ; Anderson, 1997, MANAGING STRATEGIC ; Arend RJ, 2017, STRATEGIC MANAGE J, V38, P1741, DOI 10.1002/smj.242; Bryson J.M., 2011, STRATEGIC PLANNING ; Bryson JM, 2018, PUBLIC MANAG REV, V20, P317, DOI 10.1080/14719037.2017.128511; Cardinal LB, 2001, ORGAN SCI, V12, P19, DOI 10.1287/orsc.12.1.19.1011; Crisp P., 1981, STRATEGIC PLANNING ; DeJong BP, 2014, J ENG TECHNOL, V31, P; Dooris M., 2003, PLANNING HIGHER ED, V31, P2; EADIE DC, 1983, PUBLIC ADMIN REV, V43, P447, DOI 10.2307/97585; Freedman Lawrence, 2013, STRATEGY A HIS; HOLMES J, 1985, POLITICS, V20, P2; Jennings D, 1998, DECISION MAKING INT; Keller G., 1995, MANAGEMENT REVOLUTI; KOTLER P, 1981, J HIGH EDUC, V52, P470, DOI 10.2307/198183; LANGLEY A, 1988, LONG RANGE PLANN, V21, P40, DOI 10.1016/0024-6301(88)90032-; Larsen IM, 2005, REFORM CHANGE HIGHER, P34; Namus B., 1995, VISIONARY LEADERSHI; Ruben BD, 2010, STRATEGIC PLANNING ; Salem H., 2015, GETTING MOST OUT U ; Spee AP, 2011, ORGAN STUD, V32, P1217, DOI 10.1177/017084061141138; Steiner G.A., 1979, STRATEGIC PLANNING ; Stone MM, 1996, STRATEGIC MANAGE J, V17, P633, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199610)17:8<633::AID-SMJ837>3.0.CO;2-; Taylor JS, 2008, EUR J EDUC, V43, P369, DOI 10.1111/j.1465-3435.2008.00363.",26,1,1,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The growth of service industry is still driven mainly by factor input. The resource reconfiguration effect has not yet become the main force driving the growth of TFP of the service industry. However, the structural dividend has become more and more obvious after 2008. The marginal production of capital in most service industries has reached a stage of total reduction and rapid convergence, and there is a convergence of marginal returns of capital within the service industry. The marginal production of labor in most service industries is on the stage of decrease in growth rate and increase in the total amount. Although the marginal production of labor still exhibits divergent characteristics, it has begun to show signs of convergence at the end of the study period. There are phenomena of mismatching resources, and the state control or monopoly industry is more serious. The government should improve the property rights system, expand openness, and formulate supporting policies to different industries to promote the optimal allocation of resources.","[Hu, Yanhui] Yanshan Univ, Res Ctr Reg Econ Dev, Qinhuangdao, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Mengmeng] Yanshan Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Qinhuangdao, Hebei, Peoples R China","Hu, YH (corresponding author), Yanshan Univ, Res Ctr Reg Econ Dev, Qinhuangdao, Hebei, Peoples R China.",hyhui@ysu.edu.cn,,,Key Research Base of Humanities and Social Sciences of Universities in Hebei Province [JJ1912],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This article is funded by the Key Research Base of Humanities and Social Sciences of Universities in Hebei Province (JJ1912).","Baumol WJ, 1967, AM ECON REV, V57, P41; Cai F, 2015, CHIN INSIGHT, P21, DOI 10.1007/978-3-662-46103-7_; Gu NH, 2010, FINANCE TRADE EC, P10; Han GZ, 2015, THESI; [李玉梅 Li Yumei], 2017, [数量经济技术经济研究, Quantitative & Technical Economics], V34, P9; Long N., 2013, THESI; Mallick J., 2017, ADBI WORKING PAPER; Ozyurt S, 2009, OXF DEV STUD, V37, P1, DOI 10.1080/1360081080266083; Padilla-Perez R, 2017, STRUCT CHANGE ECON D, V41, P53, DOI 10.1016/j.strueco.2017.02.00; Peneder M., 2003, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, V14, P427, DOI 10.1016/S0954-349X(02)00052-; Serquin M., 1989, COMP STUDY IND EC GR, P30; Singh L., 2004, World Review of Science, Technology and Sustainable Development, V1, P37, DOI 10.1504/WRSTSD.2004.00485; Wang JJ, 2018, LANGMUIR, V34, P58, DOI 10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b0261; Wang Sheng, 2012, Chinese Journal of Zoology, V47, P; Zeng XF, 2011, QUANT TECH EC, V28, P; Zhang BC, 2019, J NANJING U FINANCE, V1, P",16,1,1,3,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

At present, to identify a person biometric technique such as face recognition is introduced. Since,a person with abnormal behaviour recognition system has reached certain level, their accomplishments in real time applications are restricted by challenges, such as illumination variations. The present visual recognition system is good at controlled illumination conditions and thermal face recognition system is better for detecting disguised persons or when there is no illumination control. Hence, a hybrid system which uses both visual and thermal images for recognising a person is better. The objective of this research is to implement a method which improves the quality of the image by fusing visual and thermal imaging images. Our research methodology has introduced to enhance servo line camera images. Nonlinear image transfer functions were introduced,and the parameters associated with those functions are determined by image statistics for making adaptive algorithms. Next methodswereintroduced for registering the visual images to their consequent thermal images. To get a transformation matrix for the registration, the landmarks in the images are first detected and a subset of those landmarks were selected to obtain the matrix, we propose a hybrid algorithm for detection, tracking and classification using OFSA algorithm to fuse the registered thermal and visual images. In this research, we focus on object detection using OFSA algorithm for more accuracy.","[Teju, V; Bhavana, D.] Koneru Lakshmaiah Educ Fdn, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India","Teju, V (corresponding author), Koneru Lakshmaiah Educ Fdn, Guntur 522502, Andhra Pradesh, India.",teju@kluniversity.in,"Ventrapragada, Teju/U-4899-2018; D, Bhavana/AAW-1660-2021","Ventrapragada, Teju/0000-0003-2119-8792; ",,,"Alsulami F, 2016, INT CONF ELECTRO INF, P357, DOI 10.1109/EIT.2016.753526; Benenson R, 2015, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V8926, P613, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-16181-5_4; CARRON T, 1994, IEEE IMAGE PROC, P977, DOI 10.1109/ICIP.1994.41369; Chang S-L, 2011 INT C SYST SC; Choi Y, 2016, 2016 IEEE/RSJ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS (IROS 2016), P223, DOI 10.1109/IROS.2016.775905; Dony, 1999, P CCECE EDM ALB CA; FU KS, 1981, PATTERN RECOGN, V13, P3, DOI 10.1016/0031-3203(81)90028-; HARALICK RM, 1985, COMPUT VISION GRAPH, V29, P100, DOI 10.1016/S0734-189X(85)90153-; HEALEY G, 1992, IEEE T SYST MAN CYB, V22, P64, DOI 10.1109/21.14131; Hedley, 1992, J ELECTRON IMAGING, V1, P37; Leykin A, 2007, COMPUTER VISION PAT; LIU JQ, 1994, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V16, P689, DOI 10.1109/34.29794; Mangale S, 2015, 2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL INSTRUMENTATION AND CONTROL (ICIC), P590, DOI 10.1109/IIC.2015.715081; Mathur G., 2016, 2016 INT C REC ADV I, P; Mouats T, 2014, 2014 SENSOR SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR DEFENCE (SSPD; PAL NR, 1993, PATTERN RECOGN, V26, P1277, DOI 10.1016/0031-3203(93)90135-; SAHOO PK, 1988, COMPUT VISION GRAPH, V41, P233, DOI 10.1016/0734-189X(88)90022-; Seal A, 2017, INT J PATTERN RECOGN, V31, DOI 10.1142/S021800141756005; Wang SF, 2014, FRONT COMPUT SCI-CHI, V8, P232, DOI 10.1007/s11704-014-2345-; Yang DW, 2019, IET IMAGE PROCESS, V13, P216, DOI 10.1049/iet-ipr.2018.534; Yining Deng, 1999, Proceedings. 1999 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (Cat.

But its final closing time has been controversial. Based on the magmatic age of the surrounding orogenic belt, the source of this set of clastic sediments is determined, which provides new important evidence for the evolution of the South Tianshan orogenic belt. The results show that the Jurassic detrital zircons from the study area were mainly derived from magmatic zircons and are deposited in a proximal source. The detrital zircon age of the Lower Jurassic Badaowan and Sangonghe Formation are concentrated in 290-260 Ma, and in 350-290 Ma and 460-390 Ma, respectively. The detrital zircon age of the Middle Jurassic Xishanyao Formation concentrates in 370-320 Ma and 450-390 Ma. There are very few zircons from the Precambrian period. These ages are consistent with the timing, indicating these clastic sediments were mainly originated from the southern margin of the Yili - Middle Tianshan Block. The Late Permian - Middle Triassic detrital zircons almost do not exist, implying that there were no contemporary magmatism related to collision or post-collision in the South Tianshan district, its complex evolution and orogenic stage are still a challenging topic. In the ancient active plate margin, the sedimentary records in the pre-arc basin can provide more information about the magmatic arc and basin-orogen coupling than the present exposed arc itself. The rhyolite, trachyte, and trachyandesite of the Dahalajunshan Formation were widely developed in the Yili - Middle Tianshan Block during the Early Carboniferous. During the formation of Wulang Formation in the Early Permian, a large number of rhyolite were developed. The age data of 75 detrital zircons were obtained from the sandstone (J1s-5) of the Sangonghe Formation, of which 74 zircons have a concordance degree of over 90%, and their age data also fall on the harmonic curv. In addition, the age of the youngest zircons increased gradually from Early to Middle Jurassic, indicating that the sediments in this period had the feature of uncovering. Our study provides a good reference for the analysis of provenance and regional tectonic evolution.","[Wang, Chao; Shi, Xin] Chengdu Univ Technol, Inst Sedimentary Geol, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chao; Shi, Xin] Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservior Geol & Exploita, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chao] Sinopec Hua Bei Oilfield Serv Corp, Nanyang, Henan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Wenjian; Zhang, Huaisheng] East China Univ Technol, State Key Lab Nucl Resources & Environm, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","Jiang, WJ (corresponding author), East China Univ Technol, State Key Lab Nucl Resources & Environm, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",jiang2017@ecit.cn,,,State Key Laboratory of Nuclear Resources and Environment (East China University of Technology) [NRE 1804],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the Open Fund(NRE 1804) of State Key Laboratory of Nuclear Resources and Environment (East China University of Technology).","An F, 2017, GONDWANA RES, V43, P41, DOI 10.1016/j.gr.2015.11.01; [白建科 Bai Jianke], 2015, [地质论评, Geological Review], V61, P19; Bhattacharya JP, 2016, EARTH-SCI REV, V153, P77, DOI 10.1016/j.earscirev.2015.10.01; Charvet J, 2011, SCI CHINA EARTH SCI, V54, P166, DOI 10.1007/s11430-010-4138-; Dickinson WR, 2000, GEOL S AM S, P15; Forcan M, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P14, DOI 10.1177/002072091775095; Gao J, 2009, INT J EARTH SCI, V98, P1221, DOI 10.1007/s00531-008-0370-; Ge RF, 2014, TECTONICS, V33, P302, DOI 10.1002/2013TC00350; Ge RF, 2012, LITHOS, V142, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.lithos.2012.02.01; Gluskin E, 1996, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V33, P195, DOI 10.1177/00207209960330030; Gou LL, 2016, J ASIAN EARTH SCI, V115, P40, DOI 10.1016/j.jseaes.2015.09.02; Gu CC, 2018, GONDWANA RES, V60, P194, DOI 10.1016/j.gr.2018.04.01; Han BF, 2011, EARTH-SCI REV, V109, P74, DOI 10.1016/j.earscirev.2011.09.00; Han BF, 2010, GEOL SOC AM BULL, V122, P627, DOI 10.1130/B26491.; Han XZ, 2008, ACTA PETROL SIN, V24, P244; Han YG, 2018, EARTH-SCI REV, V186, P129, DOI 10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.09.01; Han YG, 2016, LITHOS, V246, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.lithos.2015.12.01; He ZY, 2018, EARTH-SCI REV, V185, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.05.01; [侯明才 Hou Mingcai], 2016, [地质学报, Acta Geologica Sinica], V90, P333; Huang H, 2015, LITHOS, V228, P23, DOI 10.1016/j.lithos.2015.04.01; Huang H, 2018, GEOL SOC AM BULL, V130, P952, DOI 10.1130/B31588.; IPSON SS, 1991, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V28, P322, DOI 10.1177/00207209910280040; Jiang CY, 1993, ACTA PETROLOGICA MIN, V12, P22; Jiang T, 2014, TECTONOPHYSICS, V612, P106, DOI 10.1016/j.tecto.2013.11.03; Jiang W., 2018, J E CHINA U SCI TECH, V41, P30; Kroner A, 2013, GONDWANA RES, V23, P272, DOI 10.1016/j.gr.2012.05.00; Li D, 2015, J ASIAN EARTH SCI, V113, P728, DOI 10.1016/j.jseaes.2015.09.00; [李鸿 Li Hong], 2011, [新疆地质, Xinjiang Geology], V29, P38; [李继磊 LI Ji-lei], 2009, [地质通报, Geological Bulletin of China], V28, P185; Liu DD, 2014, INT J EARTH SCI, V103, P737, DOI 10.1007/s00531-013-0994-; Liu YS, 2010, J PETROL, V51, P537, DOI 10.1093/petrology/egp08; Long LL, 2006, ACTA PETROL SIN, V22, P6; [马中平 MA Zhongping], 2007, [西北大学学报. 自然科学版, Journal of Northwest University.

This algorithm eliminats the limitation that the initial state should be reset to the expected one or fixed value at the start of iteration in the learning process of conventional algorithms. The error and the differences between two adjacent error is adopted to correct the controller avoiding the unstable influence of the derivative for PD type algorithm and the available information is fully used to increase convergence rate. Furthermore variable forgetting factor introduced guaranteed a fast convergence of trajectory tracking error Then, with applying the rapid algorithm to the trajectory tracking control of manipulator, the learning speed and tracking performance are both greatly improved. Meanwhile, the control strategy is proposed for the limitation of each joint rotation. The convergence of the method is also proved theoretically. Finally, simulation results illustrates the effectiveness and the real-time ability of the proposed way.","[Cheng, Xiaoyan; Wang, Hongbin; Feng, Shaochan] Yanshan Univ, Key Lab Ind Comp Control Engn Hebei Prov, Qinhuangdao 066004, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Xiaoyan; Wang, Qinzhao] Army Acad Armored Forces, Weap & Control Dept, Beijing, Peoples R China","Wang, HB (corresponding author), Yanshan Univ, Key Lab Ind Comp Control Engn Hebei Prov, Qinhuangdao 066004, Hebei, Peoples R China.",94180102@qq.com,,,,,"Bozorgi F, 2011, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V48, P146, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.48.2.; Fan Y, 2009, IEEE NUCL SCI CONF R, P350; Fang Z., 2001, CONTROL DECISION, V16, P86; Li HJ, 2007, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 26TH CHINESE CONTROL CONFERENCE, VOL 2, P2; Li Junmin, 2000, Control Theory & Applications, V17, P57; MALIK OP, 1974, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V11, P313, DOI 10.1177/00207209740110040; Meng D, 2010, IET CONTROL THEORY A, V4, P759, DOI 10.1049/iet-cta.2008.051; PARK DJ, 1991, ELECTRON LETT, V27, P2150, DOI 10.1049/el:1991133; Park KH, 1998, IEE P-CONTR THEOR AP, V145, P507, DOI 10.1049/ip-cta:1998240; Ruan XE, 2001, AUTOMATICA, V27, P21; Sun M.X., 1999, ITERATIVE LEARNING ; Sun Ming-xuan, 2007, Control and Decision, V22, P84; [王洪斌 Wang Hongbin], 2011, [系统工程理论与实践, Systems Engineering-Theory & Practice], V31, P16; Xie SL, 2001, ACTA AUTOMATICA SINI, V27, P1; Xu JM, 1993, IEEE C COMP COMM AUT, P9; Yan F., 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V10, P12; Yao Zhong-shu, 2003, Control Theory & Applications, V20, P45",17,1,1,1,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This paper selects two kinds of large-scale sports events of different types and scales as research objects, uses Excel data statistics method, Newtonian mechanics analysis, chaotic dynamics etc. to define and classify sports media events, and conducts research on visualization report of the evolution rules. The influence of sports media events is positively correlated with the scale of sports events. The evolution process includes three periods as initial period, high-tide period and decay period, has a similar process periodicity, and shows obvious chaotic characteristics such as initial value sensitivity, intrinsic randomness, fractal similarity, etc. The visualization of sports news data based on the Neutrosophy theory is the application of visualization in the news industry. The basic principle is universal. The difference lies in the fact that the news generalizes and arranges complex data with news value, and plays the role of disseminating news and satisfies the audiences' needs for obtaining information.","[Li, Junhong] Changzhou Coll Informat Technol, Sports Dept, Changzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, ShuBin] Changzhou Univ, Huaide Coll, Jingjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhijun] Nanjing Inst Phys Educ & Sports, Sports Training Inst, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Guo, Jianqiang] Changzhou Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Changzhou, Peoples R China","Wang, ZJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Inst Phys Educ & Sports, Sports Training Inst, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;Guo, JQ (corresponding author), Changzhou Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Changzhou, Peoples R China.",zj116@sohu.com; gjq@cczu.edu.cn,,,,,"Ben Yahia S, 2004, IEEE INT CONF FUZZY, P22; Buono P, 2005, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3379, P22; Cao GL, 2016, ELECT TECHNOL SOFTW, V19, P20; Cheng B., 2013, E COMMERCE, V09, P6; Ertek G, 2006, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V4263, P59; Geng XH, 2006, COMPUT APPL SOFTW, V02, P8; Hahsler M., 2017, J BUSINESS EC, V87, P317, DOI [10.1007/s11573-016-0822-8, DOI 10.1007/S11573-016-0822-8; Keim DA, 2002, IEEE T VIS COMPUT GR, V8, P1, DOI 10.1109/2945.98184; Maniyar DM, 2006, ACM SIGKDD INT C KNO, P64; Oncel AF, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P208, DOI 10.1177/002072091878871; Perotoni MB, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P193, DOI 10.1177/002072091879009; Sun JL, 2008, MODERN INFORM, V03, P10; Wang L., 2015, SCI TECHNOL COMMUN, V0; Yan W., 2016, VOCATIONAL EDU MIDMO, V12, P6; Yang LB, 2015, LIB INFORM SERV, VS2, P14; Zhang J., 2013, J CHONGQING TECHNOL, V0; Zhang JL, 2013, MODERN DISTANCE ED R, V0; Zhang ZH, 2013, COMMUN WORLD, V21, P2",18,1,1,2,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Therefore the engineering concepts of comfort and ease of working for long durations have become the mainstay of industries the world over. These concepts are complemented by the inputs of safety, hygiene and worker friendliness especially inthe global garment manufacturing industry. They need to be evaluated scientifically. One of these means is the evaluation by using OCRA. The basic concept of OCRA, therefore, is to determine and measure a defined technical action. It examines the series of complex movements necessary to complete a work task, involving the upper limb joints at the shoulder, elbow, wrist and finger level. Various scholars have documented the root causes of musculoskeletal discomfort among the seated workers and have delineatedthemas the constrained work posture and repetitive tasks. Currently, the researcher is working on three work aid prototypes by incorporating workstation design principles for modifications to improve working posture.","[Rana, Kamaljit Singh; Randhawa, Jagjit Singh; Kalra, Parveen] Deemed Univ, Dept Prod & Ind Engn, PEC Univ Technol, Chandigarh, UT, India","Rana, KS (corresponding author), Deemed Univ, Dept Prod & Ind Engn, PEC Univ Technol, Chandigarh, UT, India.",Kamaljitsinghrana@yahoo.co.in,,"Randhawa, Jagjit Singh/0000-0002-0172-775X",,,"Bernaards CM, 2007, PAIN, V132, P142, DOI 10.1016/j.pain.2007.06.00; BRISSON C, 1989, SCAND J WORK ENV HEA, V15, P329, DOI 10.5271/sjweh.184; BURDORF A, 1991, SCAND J WORK ENV HEA, V17, P425, DOI 10.5271/sjweh.167; Chaffin D B, 1973, J Occup Med, V15, P34; COLLIGAN MJ, 1979, J OCCUP PSYCHOL, V52, P77, DOI 10.1111/j.2044-8325.1979.tb00444.; Colovic G., 2014, ERGONOMICS GARMENT I, P17; Das B, 1996, APPL ERGON, V27, P157, DOI 10.1016/0003-6870(96)00008-; Delleman NJ, 2002, INT J IND ERGONOM, V30, P341, DOI 10.1016/S0169-8141(02)00100-; Gillian H., 1993, INT J IND ERGONOM, V12, P3, DOI DOI 10.1016/0169-8141(93)90033-; Greenleaf J E, 1982, Exerc Sport Sci Rev, V10, P8; GREENLEAF JE, 1984, J APPL PHYSIOL, V57, P619, DOI 10.1152/jappl.1984.57.3.61; HAGBERG C, 1987, J ORAL REHABIL, V14, P531, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2842.1987.tb00749.; HAGBERG M, 1987, BRIT J IND MED, V44, P60; Handler W.

Accordingly, their remedies call for residents to transform their Pro-environmental behavior (PEB) from individual level to collective level. Based on the perspective of self-identity process and social identity process, this research proposes a comprehensive model by integrating elements from theory of planned behavior (TPB), self-identity theory and social identity theory. To assess the model, we have designed questionnaire and collected the survey data using Questionnaire Star (a professional data platform in China). The data were analyzed using both structural equation model (AMOS) and regression analysis (SPSS). It is found that there exist interactions between individual and collective factors, and their positive influence on PEB of the individuals with varying strengths. The broader view of the model can enhance our understanding regarding the intricate internal structure of ecological behavior, and it can also offer valuable reference when formulating environmental policies and education strategies.","[Huang, Liping] Shanghai Normal Univ, Dept Exhibit Management, Coll Tourism, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Ou, Jing; Gao, Jun] Hunan Univ, Sch Design, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Gao, Jun] Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Environm & Geog Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Gao, J (corresponding author), Shanghai Normal Univ, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China.",gaojun@shnu.edu.cn,,"Huang, Liping/0000-0002-1372-1830",,,"Ajzen I., 1985, ACTION CONTROL, P11, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-69746-3_; [Anonymous], [No title captured; Band R, 2019, PATIENT EDUC COUNS, V102, P1389, DOI 10.1016/j.pec.2019.02.02; Bandura A, 2000, CURR DIR PSYCHOL SCI, V9, P75, DOI 10.1111/1467-8721.0006; BRYCE P, 1982, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V19, P17, DOI 10.1177/00207209820190010; Carfora V, 2017, J ENVIRON PSYCHOL, V53, P92, DOI 10.1016/j.jenvp.2017.07.00; Chen MF, 2015, J ENVIRON PSYCHOL, V42, P66, DOI 10.1016/j.jenvp.2015.02.00; Cho YN, 2013, J BUS RES, V66, P1052, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2012.08.02; Crow G, 1994, COMMUNITY LIFE INTR; Gkargkavouzi A, 2019, RESOUR CONSERV RECY, V148, P145, DOI 10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.01.03; Gneezy A, 2012, MANAGE SCI, V58, P179, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.1110.143; Greenaway KH, 2015, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V109, P53, DOI 10.1037/pspi000001; Harring N, 2019, RESOUR CONSERV RECY, V140, P85, DOI 10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.09.00; Haslam C, 2015, J AGING HEALTH, V28, P197040225; Jugert P, 2016, J ENVIRON PSYCHOL, V48, P12, DOI 10.1016/j.jenvp.2016.08.00; Lalot F, 2019, J ENVIRON PSYCHOL, V61, P79, DOI 10.1016/j.jenvp.2019.01.00; Mancha RM, 2015, J ENVIRON PSYCHOL, V43, P145, DOI 10.1016/j.jenvp.2015.06.00; Pelenc J, 2015, ECOL ECON, V118, P226, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.07.00; Tabernero C, 2015, J ENVIRON MANAGE, V159, P192, DOI 10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.05.02; Tabernero C, 2012, SPAN J PSYCHOL, V15, P648, DOI 10.5209/rev_SJOP.2012.v15.n2.3887; Tajfel H., 1979, SOCIAL PSYCHOL INTER, P9; van Zomeren M, 2008, PSYCHOL BULL, V134, P504, DOI 10.1037/0033-2909.134.4.50; Wang F, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V57, P7; Whitmarsh L, 2010, J ENVIRON PSYCHOL, V30, P305, DOI 10.1016/j.jenvp.2010.01.00; Wicklund R.

This approach is capable of solving for the basic flow character over a rough wall at high Reynolds numbers without resolving the details of the roughness elements. The wall-modelled LES approach on a smooth wall is proven to be sufficiently precise to predict the velocity profile and wall shear stress. The average roughness shear stress can be combined with the smooth-wall shear stress in the inner-layer wall model by defining a roughness shear stress ratio alpha. The instantaneous shear stresses caused by the roughness elements are calculated by the pressure projection and elevation fields. The total shear stress is fed back to the outer-layer LES mesh as a new boundary condition. The results of the wall-modelled LES correspond well with the experimental data. The comparison between the simulation and experiment reveals that the wall-modelled LES approach presented in this research is capable of predicting the flow in a rough-wall boundary layer without resolving the detailed roughness element geometries.,"[Chen, Binqi] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Aeronaut & Astronaut, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yiding] Sichuan Tengden Technol Co Ltd, Chengdu 610015, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yu] China Aerosp Sci & Technol Corp, Inst Manned Space Syst Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China","Wang, YD (corresponding author), Sichuan Tengden Technol Co Ltd, Chengdu 610015, Peoples R China.",wyding127@163.com,,"Wang, Yiding/0000-0001-7393-980X",,,"Balaras E, 1996, AIAA J, V34, P1111, DOI 10.2514/3.1320; Bayrak A, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P265, DOI 10.1177/002072091880044; Blake W.

To obtain the types of failure, a novel fault diagnosis method based on back propagation (BP) neural network with Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) algorithm for PV modules is proposed. Through the in-depth analysis the output of PV modules under normal and fault conditions, the input variables of the diagnosis model are acquired. The high-speed and real-time fault diagnosis model for PV modules is first designed based on TMS320VC5402 DSP and long-distance wireless fault diagnosis is realized by Zigbee technology. The simulation and experimental results show that the fault diagnosis method for PV modules based on BP network with L-M algorithm can effectively detect four types of fault for PV modules such as open circuit, short circuit, partial shading and abnormal degradation. The numerical results verify the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method, which can provide a great educational benefit of PV operation technology.","[Chen, Ling; Cao, Xiang] Huaiyin Normal Univ, Sch Phys & Elect Elect Engn, Huaian, Peoples R China; [Han, Wei; Li, Hai-Tao; Xu, Zi-Kun] State Grid Jiangsu Elect Power Co Ltd, Huaian 223001, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jing-Wei] Hohai Univ, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Changzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Han, W (corresponding author), State Grid Jiangsu Elect Power Co Ltd, Huaian 223001, Peoples R China.",carolcl1987@126.com,,,Natural Science Research Program of Huai'an City [HAB201831],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors acknowledge the Natural Science Research Program of Huai'an City (Grant: HAB201831).","Appiah AY, 2019, IEEE ACCESS, V7, P30089, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.290294; Belaout A, 2018, RENEW ENERG, V127, P548, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2018.05.00; Blaifi S, 2018, ELECTR ENG, V100, P1021, DOI 10.1007/s00202-017-0567-; Chen LA, 2018, IEEE T SMART GRID, V9, P1835, DOI 10.1109/TSG.2016.260108; Dhimish M, 2017, ENERGY, V140, P276, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2017.08.10; Dhimish M, 2017, HIGH VOLT, V2, P244, DOI 10.1049/hve.2017.004; Harrou F, 2018, RENEW ENERG, V116, P22, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2017.09.04; Huang JM, 2019, IEEE ACCESS, V7, P70919, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.291933; Kamath HG, 2019, IEEE J PHOTOVOLT, V9, P424, DOI 10.1109/JPHOTOV.2018.288362; Kumar BP, 2018, IEEE J PHOTOVOLT, V8, P257, DOI 10.1109/JPHOTOV.2017.277015; Madeti SR, 2017, SOL ENERGY, V158, P161, DOI 10.1016/j.solener.2017.08.06; Mansouri M, 2018, ENERGY, V159, P842, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2018.06.19; Martin C, 2020, ENERG CONVERS MANAGE, V210, P11271; Mellit A, 2018, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V91, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2018.03.06; Triki-Lahiani A, 2018, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V82, P2680, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2017.09.10; Zarkovic MD, 2015, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V52, P81, DOI 10.1177/002072091557054; Zhang C, 2008, NEUROCOMPUTING, V72, P513, DOI 10.1016/j.neucom.2007.12.00; Zhang KF, 2016, ARAB J SCI ENG, V41, P3451, DOI 10.1007/s13369-015-2001-; Zhang WB, 2019, IEEE ACCESS, V7, P11736, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.289272; Zhao ZZ, 2016, NEURAL COMPUT APPL, V27, P375, DOI 10.1007/s00521-015-1850-; Zhu HL, 2018, SOL ENERGY, V176, P395, DOI 10.1016/j.solener.2018.10.05; Zimny J, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P142, DOI 10.1177/002072091775095",22,2,2,1,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology has been widely used in the development of the construction industry in recent years. It can effectively realize the integration of building information, so that all parties involved in the project can work together based on the same platform, which can more effectively improve work efficiency and save resource input, lower construction costs, and ultimately achieve the goal of sustainable development.

It aims at training skilled talents, which has made great contribution to the economy and industry. Generally, designing courses in high vocational education includes teaching analysis, teaching strategy, teaching practice and teaching assessment. Among the teaching steps, teaching assessment is one of the most important method to improve the quality of course teaching. However, in most high vocational education courses, traditional written exam is still the primary tools of assessments, which can not fulfill the development of high vocational education. In order to improve the quality of high vocational education, it is very urgent to design a practical and efficient system with multiple assessments. We exploit machine learning techniques to design assessment system for high vocation education. Machine learning is a very powerful tool for data analysis and it has been used for education tools in recent years. First, we improve the teaching organization for training skilled talents. Second, we propose a feature selection model based on the improved teaching organization. Third, we propose a machine learning model for teaching assessment. With the main contributions and other improvements, we design a multi-assessment system for vocational teaching based on machine learning. We implement the multi-assessment system by using Python and TensorFlow, which shows that the system can provide practical and efficient multiple assessments for vocational teaching based on training machine learning model.

This paper studies the prediction model of sports lottery income, and provides data support and theoretical basis for relevant government policies Methods: Using the time series data of sports lottery revenue over the years, this paper studies the prediction model, compares the evaluation and selects the appropriate model, and uses the model to predict the future development of sports lottery revenue in China. Results: Through comparison, it is found that the cubic curve model has the best fitting effect on sports lottery income (R2 = 0.994, MAPE = 5.10). Using this model to predict sports lottery, it will exceed 500 billion yuan in 2025. Conclusion: the prediction model of sports lottery revenue in China is suitable to adopt the cubic curve model, which indicates that the sports lottery revenue in China will keep increasing.","[Xu, Haihong; Zhou, Caiyou] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Coll Phys Educ, Nanchang 330027, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Lin, Yanmin] Lvliang Univ, Inst Fitness & Rehabil, Dept Phys Educ, Lvliang, Peoples R China","Zhou, CY (corresponding author), Jiangxi Normal Univ, Coll Phys Educ, Nanchang 330027, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",382374469@qq.com,,,,,"[Anonymous], 2015, THESI; [Anonymous], 2014, THESI; Beiza J, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P124, DOI 10.1177/002072091878873; Chen CJ., 2011, SPORTS CULTURE GUIDE, V29, P9; Chen PO, 2015, J WUHAN I PHYS ED, V5; Chen YY., 2013, STAT DECISION MAKING, V29, P13; Dong YY, 2008, J HANGZHOU U ELECT S, V28, P6; Gang L., 2008, SPORTS SCI, V28, P3; He GM., 2012, J BEIJING SPORT U, V35, P2; He JD, 2011, SPORTS CULTURE GUIDE, V29, P1; Lin Y.P., 2007, J NANJING I PHYS ED, V6, P3; Liu Y, 2014, THESIS TU MUNCHEN M; Luo JM., 2012, MODERN EC INFORM, V27, P; Naqvi SR, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P140, DOI 10.1177/002072091879010; Pin Y., 2009, MATH STAT MANAG, V28, P92; Piskin G., 2011, SPATIAL ANAL ARCHAE; Sun QX, 2010, PRACT UNDERSTAND MAT, V40, P2; Zhang X, 2006, J BEIJING SPORT U, V4; Zhao JC., 2012, J WUHAN I PHYS ED, V54, P4; Zhao JC, 2012, J WUHAN I PHYS ED, V54, P7; Zhao RY, 2011, SCI TECHNOL INFORM, V29, P19; ZHONG Jiang, 2015, CONT SPORTS TECHNOLO, V5, P14; Zhu DG, 2015, MODERN EC INFORM, V30, P33; Zhu XL, 2013, JIANGSU SOC SCI, V34, P13",24,0,0,6,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In view of the shortcomings of the above method, we put forward a new technique of rolling bearings for fault detection, which combines wavelet packet dispersion entropy (WPDE) and artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) optimize support vector machines (AFSA-SVM). First of all, wavelet packet is devoted to decompose the original vibration signal into components of different frequency bands. Secondly, the dispersion entropy (DE) are calculated for each of the obtained frequency band components to acquire more comprehensive and complete fault information. Afterward, Input feature samples into the SVM model for training, and AFSA is used to optimize the parameters of SVM to obtain the optimal value so as to establish the best classification model. Finally, the prepared test set is input into AFSA-SVM for fault classification. The achievement of bearing detection experiments show that this approach can accurately and quickly identify fault types.","[Liu, Wuqiang; Shen, Jinxing; Yang, Xiaoqiang] Army Engn Univ PLA, Field Engn Coll, Nanjing 210007, Peoples R China","Shen, JX (corresponding author), Army Engn Univ PLA, Field Engn Coll, Nanjing 210007, Peoples R China.",565423803@qq.com,,,,,"Ai Yan-ting, 2013, Journal of Aerospace Power, V28, P216; Costa M, 2005, PHYS REV E, V71, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevE.71.02190; [郭惠勇 Guo Huiyong], 2017, [振动与冲击, Journal of Vibration and Shock], V36, P5; Lee HY, 2019, INT J ELECT ENG ED, DOI 10.1177/002072091983305; [李梅红 Li Meihong], 2019, [机械强度, Journal of Mechanical Strength], V41, P58; [李学军 Li Xuejun], 2015, [振动、测试与诊断, Journal of Vibration, Measurement and Diagnosis], V35, P103; Rostaghi M, 2019, J SOUND VIB, V438, P291, DOI 10.1016/j.jsv.2018.08.02; Rostaghi M, 2016, IEEE SIGNAL PROC LET, V23, P610, DOI 10.1109/LSP.2016.254288; Xu Yong-gang, 2002, Information and Control, V21, P54; Yang Y, 2019, COMPUT ENG APPL, V21, P; Zhang SM, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091989106; Zheng Hong, 2015, Journal of Aerospace Power, V30, P3035, DOI 10.13224/j.cnki.jasp.2015.12.02; Zheng JD, 2012, J HUNAN U NATURAL SC, V39, P384; Zheng JD, 2017, ENTROPY-SWITZ, V19, DOI 10.3390/e1911058; [郑近德 Zheng Jinde], 2013, [振动、测试与诊断, Journal of Vibration, Measurement and Diagnosis], V33, P29",15,3,3,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Many methods have been proposed in image enhancement field. However, in these methods the noise is usually considered as harmful and should be removed as much as possible. Stochastic resonance is a very different method, in which the noise is regarded as a driver to push the stochastic resonance system to output enhanced image. In this paper, the cumulative gain is introduced and the sequence average is used to enhance the original image information which hidden in a noised image sequence produced by bistable stochastic resonance. We present the one-dimensional and two-dimensional stochastic resonance methods and discuss their performance in this paper. Experiments illustrate that the one-dimensional average stochastic resonance has the best performance considering the indicator PSNR and SSIM. Compared with traditional filters such as median and Wiener filters, the proposed methods have significant advantages.","[Ma, Chunbo; Ao, Jun] Guilin Univ Elect Technol, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China","Ao, J (corresponding author), Guilin Univ Elect Technol, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China.",653515460@qq.com,,,Guangxi National Science Foundation [2018GXNSFAA294056],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Guangxi National Science Foundation: 2018GXNSFAA294056.","ASDI AS, 1995, INT CONF ACOUST SPEE, P1332, DOI 10.1109/ICASSP.1995.48048; BENZI R, 1981, J PHYS A-MATH GEN, V14, pL453, DOI 10.1088/0305-4470/14/11/00; Chan RH, 2005, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V14, P1479, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2005.85219; FAUVE S, 1983, PHYS LETT A, V97, P5, DOI 10.1016/0375-9601(83)90086-; Gonzalez R.C., 2008, DIGITAL IMAGE PROCES, V3rd, P34; HUANG TS, 1979, IEEE T ACOUST SPEECH, V27, P13, DOI 10.1109/TASSP.1979.116318; Inchiosa ME, 1996, PHYS REV E, V53, pR2021, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevE.53.R202; Jayaraj V, 2010, EURASIP J ADV SIG PR, DOI 10.1155/2010/69021; Jiang Y, 2016, INT CONF INSTR MEAS, P416, DOI 10.1109/IMCCC.2016.13; KARTHIK B, 2014, MIDDLE EAST J SCI RE, V20, P1222, DOI DOI 10.5829/idosi.mejsr.2014.20.10.11406; Leng Y-G, 2008, 2008 ASME INT MECH E, P87; Liu J, 2015, IET IMAGE PROCESS, V9, P1033, DOI 10.1049/iet-ipr.2014.070; Loreto-Gomez G, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P163, DOI 10.1177/002072091879011; Ma CB, 2019, MULTIMED TOOLS APPL, V78, P1131, DOI 10.1007/s11042-018-6442-; Naqvi SR, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P140, DOI 10.1177/002072091879010; Wang N, 2018, NONLINEAR DYNAM, V94, P295, DOI 10.1007/s11071-018-4359-; Xu BH, 2007, INT CONF ACOUST SPEE, P71; Yang YB, 2009, J PHYS A-MATH THEOR, V42, DOI 10.1088/1751-8113/42/14/14520",18,2,2,4,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Therefore, it is particularly important to meet the needs of special children's campus construction. However, China is relatively backward, and special education schools lack complete landscape design for special groups. Campus landscape carries many contents including education, leisure, communication and rehabilitation. At present, the landscape design of special education schools lacks the recognition of the particularity of special children, and ignores their demands for normal communication and interaction. Starting from the characteristics of special children, this paper analyses and studies the perceptual characteristics of hearing impaired students and visual impaired students respectively, and applies the concept of interactive design to the landscape design of special schools. Interaction design pays attention to the process of human experience, which coincides with the design idea of people-oriented emphasized in landscape design.

Specifically, it relies on spark cloud technology and data mining technology of cash to build an English education information management system. Secondly, in the educational information management platform, convolution neural network classification algorithm is used to mine useful information. Convolution network mainly combines the emotional words, parts of speech, degree adverbs, negatives, punctuation and other word features that affect the emotional tendency of the text to form an extended text feature. Then, the word vector feature and the extended text feature are used as two input channels of convolution neural network, and the dynamic K-max pooling strategy is adopted to improve the ability of feature extraction of the model. The experiment in the English education information management system shows that the classification performance of the algorithm in this paper is not only higher than that of the single channel convolution neural network algorithm, but also has some advantages compared with some representative algorithms. In addition, experiments verify the effectiveness of the educational information management system.","[Zhao, Shubo; Miao, Guoxin] Jilin Univ Finance & Econ, Coll Foreign Language Teaching & Res Inst, Changchun, Peoples R China;

The results show that in the tripartite game, the more the expected revenue of government departments, enterprises, and the public increases, the more likely it is that the government departments will adopt a strict supervision strategy and the company will choose to assume social responsibility. The higher the cost of government supervision, the higher the cost of corporate social responsibility, and the more the loss of social welfare. Then the government department adopts a general regulatory strategy, and the company chooses not to assume social responsibility, the more likely the public will give negative evaluation of the company. The conclusion is that the strict supervision of the government supervision department has greatly increased the penalty 'cost of enterprises' failure to perform social responsibility. This helps enterprises to consciously perform social responsibility, and thus get positive comments from the public.","[Zhao, Xin; Zhao, Hong] Tianjin Polytech Univ, Tianjin 300160, Peoples R China","Zhao, H (corresponding author), Tianjin Polytech Univ, Tianjin 300160, Peoples R China.",289242785@qq.com,,,Tianjin Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project An Empirical Study on the Evaluation of Corporate Social Responsibility and Relative Performance in the Context of `New Age' [TJGLQN18-010],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by Tianjin Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project An Empirical Study on the Evaluation of Corporate Social Responsibility and Relative Performance in the Context of `New Age' (Grant no.

However, there are still some problems in the technological innovation network of major engineering projects, such as unclear responsibilities and rights among innovation subjects, and poor information communication, which make the technological innovation network of major engineering projects present low safety. The technological innovation network of major engineering projects is an alliance, and the dual governance consisting of formal contract governance and relational contract governance is an effective way to solve the alliance problem. Due to the transaction cost theory and relationship contract theory, identify the influencing factors of dual governance on the vulnerability of technological innovation network of major engineering projects through literature analysis. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the fragility of dual governance to the technological innovation network of major engineering projects. First, according to the transaction cost theory and relationship contract theory, the paper identifies the influencing factors of dual governance on the vulnerability of technological innovation network of major engineering projects. Then, using the complex network theory, a network model of influencing factors of technological innovation network vulnerability for major engineering projects is constructed, and MATLAB is used to simulate and analyze its vulnerability. The results are compared with the relevant network topology parameters, and finally the recommendations for reducing vulnerability are proposed. The findings provide a certain reference value for management and decision-making in the process of technological innovation of major engineering projects.","[Guo, Bin] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Publ Adm, Xian, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Zijing; Feng, Tao] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Management, Xian, Peoples R China","Cheng, ZJ (corresponding author), Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Xian 710055, Peoples R China.",chengzijing0729@126.com,,,,,"Beiza J, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P124, DOI 10.1177/002072091878873; Bossink BAG, 2004, J CONSTR ENG M, V130, P337, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2004)130:3(337; Cao Z, 2015, J OPER MANAG, V33-34, P15, DOI 10.1016/j.jom.2014.09.00; Chan APC, 2004, J CONSTR ENG M, V130, P188, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2004)130:2(188; Cheng EWL, 2000, J MANAGE ENG, V16, P84, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2000)16:2(84; Foss NJ, 2007, ORGANIZATION, V14, P29, DOI 10.1177/135050840707185; Guibing G, 2018, COMPUT INTEGR MANUF, V24, P228; Hongtao X., 2013, TECHNOL EC, V32, P2; Hongtao X, 2010, FORUM SCI TECHNOL CH, V6, P2; Jianchang L, 2015, SCI TECHNOL PROG POL, V32, P11; Jiasen R, 2015, CHIN J MANAG, V12, P45; Lei Z, 2016, SCI TECHNOL PROG POL, V33, P; Liu H, 2014, FRONT ENG MANAG, V1, P202, DOI 10.15302/J-FEM-201402; Liu H, 2016, J CIV ENG MANAG, V22, P401, DOI 10.3846/13923730.2014.97573; Manley K, 2017, J MANAGE ENG, V33, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.000054; Mengjun W, 2011, STRATEGIC STUDY CAE, V13, P6; Mengjun W, 2012, STRATEGIC STUDY CAE, V14, P10; Mengjun W, 2016, J CHINA RAILWAY SOC, V38, P14; Naqvi SR, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P140, DOI 10.1177/002072091879010; Ozorhon B, 2013, J MANAGE ENG, V29, P455, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.000015; Papadonikolaki E, 2018, J MANAGE ENG, V34, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.000064; Skibniewski MJ, 2013, J CIV ENG MANAG, V19, P136, DOI 10.3846/13923730.2012.75606; Wan D, 2005, TECHNOVATION, V25, P261, DOI 10.1016/S0166-4972(03)00096-; Wei Tong Chen, 2007, International Journal of Project Management, V25, P475, DOI 10.1016/j.ijproman.2006.12.00; Xue XL, 2018, J CLEAN PROD, V173, P265, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.01.00; Yang Y., 2014, SCI TECHNOLOGY PROGR, V31, P1; Yongfu S, 2012, J CHINA RAILWAY SOC, V34, P7; Zhen Z., 2016, SCI TECHNOL PROG POL, V33, P10; Zhensen Z, 2012, SCI TECHNOL PROG POL, V29, P3; Zhensen Z, 2013, MODERNIZATION MANAG, V2, P2; Zhensen Z, 2012, J ADV INFORM SCI SER, V22, P39",31,0,0,13,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

During emergency evacuation, the pace of the crowd and the effective width of the roads are closely relevant. At present, there are differences in the setting of effective width of road in the central business district at home and abroad, and they pay more attention to the general traffic value of road, without too much research and exploration on the setting of effective width of road in emergency evacuation. In the case of limited space resources, it is increasingly important to study the effect of effective width of road on pedestrian evacuation in the central business district. Based on this, this paper conducts Research measure on the effective width of road, business center of the Three Gorges Square in Chongqing. After research measuring, it is modally analyzed according to relevant regulation. The result of the research shows that the main pedestrian road of Three Gorges Square can't meet the demands of the urgent evacuation. And when the effective width of the roads w >= 7.6 m, it can meet the demands of high-density pedestrian evacuation in commercial center.","[Wang, Zhigang; Zhou, Tiejun; Yang, Gen] Chongqing Univ, Fac Architecture & Urban Planning, Chongqing 400030, Peoples R China","Wang, ZG (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Fac Architecture & Urban Planning, Chongqing 400030, Peoples R China.",201715021015@cqu.edu.cn,,,National Science Foundation: Urban Central Business District Open Space Design for Pedestrian Evacuation Respond [51678084],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funding Project of National Science Foundation: Urban Central Business District Open Space Design for Pedestrian Evacuation Respond to Emergency Events (Grant no. 51678084).","Chu J., 2014, PLANNING METHOD APP; GALEA ER, 1994, FIRE SAFETY J, V22, P341, DOI 10.1016/0379-7112(94)90040-; Gwynne S, 1999, BUILD ENVIRON, V34, P741, DOI 10.1016/S0360-1323(98)00057-; Loreto-Gomez G, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P163, DOI 10.1177/002072091879011; Naqvi SR, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P140, DOI 10.1177/002072091879010; Nelson H.

Unlike the previous studies presented in the literature, the proposed method takes into account the excitation voltage limit and therefore formulates a new objective function for optimal PID parameters design. The practical aspect of the proposed constraint is significant since the generator field winding can be seriously damaged in case of the large excitation voltage. The performance of the proposed controller using the solution methodology proposed in this study and its contribution to the robustness of the control system are investigated. Further, the obtained PID parameters are used to simulate the AVR dynamics for a large step change in the generator's voltage set-point. Besides, the obtained step responses have been compared with the corresponding responses of the AVR system whose PID parameters are determined by using well-known methods presented in the literature. Also, the proposed AEO-PID controller shows superior performances in the case of uncertainties in the AVR system's parameters, as well as in the presence of the different disturbances in the system. The results obtained show that the obtained parameters provided a more secure and stable machine operation even with changes of the reference, generator, or excitation voltage signals compared with the performance of the controllers obtained by the previous works presented in the literature. Furthermore, AEO has proven its ability to get optimal solutions in a fast and efficient manner in terms of accuracy and time spent per iteration.","[Calasan, Martin; Micev, Mihailo] Univ Montenegro, Fac Elect Engn, Podgorica 81000, Montenegro; [Djurovic, Zeljko] Univ Belgrade, Sch Elect Engn, Belgrade, Serbia; [Mageed, Hala M.

However, with the rapid development of financial industry, the income of urban and rural residents is increasingly unbalanced. The increasing income gap between urban and rural areas has caused a large number of adverse phenomena in the process of economic development, seriously affecting the income distribution of the people and even causing social instability. Therefore, in today's big data era, it is necessary to systematically study and analyze the impact of financial industry development on the national income gap between urban and rural areas. At the same time, it is of great significance to improve the problem of excessive income gap between urban and rural areas. This paper mainly analyses the relationship between the three effects of the development of financial industry and the income gap between urban and rural residents. In the empirical aspect, the paper creatively uses the fuzzy Kmeans clustering algorithm to regression analysis the panel data of a certain area from 2010 to 2018. At the same time, in the empirical data analysis, this paper creatively replaces the European norm measure of the Kmeans clustering algorithm with the AE measure, and puts forward a proposal.

Several disastrous earthquakes have proved that seismic safety evaluation may underestimate seismic risks, which would result in serious damage of bridge structures. Therefore, a new higher level of seismic hazard named Very Rare Ground Motion (VRGM for short) is proposed innovatively to be considered in this paper for very important bridges. A novel seismic design method of simply supported girder bridges in the transverse direction for VRGMs is proposed at first. In the proposed method, seismic isolation bearings, tension-only braces and ductile piers are combined to improve the seismic performance and meet seismic requirements of VRGMs. Taking a simply supported girder bridge as a numerical analysis example, the proposed method is compared with two bridge seismic design methods adopted in current seismic codes and its parametric analysis is conducted. It's shown that the proposed seismic design method can combine the ductility capacities of piers and the functions of seismic isolation bearings and reduce all the concerned structural seismic responses in VRGMs effectively. This work provides an educational demonstration for engineers dealing with similar problems.","[Peng, Tianbo; Zou, Haoyu] Tongji Univ, State Key Lab Disaster Reduct Civil Engn, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Peng, Tianbo; Zou, Haoyu] Tongji Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lizhi] Hengshui Rubber Gen Factory Co Ltd, Hengshui, Peoples R China","Peng, TB (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, State Key Lab Disaster Reduct Civil Engn, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",ptb@tongji.edu.cn,,"Zou, Haoyu/0000-0002-2002-9033","Ministry of Science and Technology of China [SLDRCE19-B-21]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51278372, 51878489]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported partly by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, Grant No. SLDRCE19-B-21 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51278372 and No. 51878489).","AASHTO, 2008, GUID SPEC LRFD SEIS; Carden LP, 2006, J STRUCT ENG, V132, P338, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2006)132:3(338; China Earthquake Administration, 1998, 5026797 GB CHIN EAR; Chyne P, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091989107; COnnor JJ, 1997, J STRUCT ENG-ASCE, V123, P423, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(1997)123:4(423; Dicleli M., 2002, J BRIDGE ENG, V7, P94, DOI DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0702(2002)7:2(94; El-Bahey S, 2011, ENG STRUCT, V33, P1052, DOI 10.1016/j.engstruct.2010.12.02; Gao EX, 2013, APPL MECH MATER, V353-356, P2101, DOI 10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.353-356.210; Guo JWW, 2013, EARTHQ ENG STRUCT D, V42, P935, DOI 10.1002/eqe.226; Hajirasouliha I, 2012, EARTHQ ENG STRUCT D, V41, P663, DOI 10.1002/eqe.115; Kelly T.E., 2001, BASE ISOLATION STRU; Kim SH, 2006, ENG STRUCT, V28, P1071, DOI 10.1016/j.engstruct.2005.11.01; Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China, 2008, GUIDELINES SEISMIC ; Priestley MJN, 1996, BRIDGES, DOI [10.1002/9780470172858, DOI 10.1002/9780470172858; Sabelli R, 2003, ENG STRUCT, V25, P655, DOI 10.1016/S0141-0296(02)00175-; Savage I, 1999, COMPUT STRUCT, V72, P317, DOI 10.1016/S0045-7949(99)00027-; Sheng X, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091988423; Sullivan TJ, 2011, J EARTHQ ENG, V15, P1083, DOI 10.1080/13632469.2011.55460; Takeuchi T, 2008, J STRUCT ENG, V134, P822, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2008)134:5(822; Tsai KC, 2008, EARTHQ ENG STRUCT D, V37, P1099, DOI 10.1002/eqe.80; Tubaldi E, 2011, ENG STRUCT, V33, P786, DOI 10.1016/j.engstruct.2010.12.00; Usami T, 2005, EARTHQ ENG STRUCT D, V34, P471, DOI 10.1002/eqe.44; Vargas R, 2009, J STRUCT ENG, V135, P394, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2009)135:4(394; Vargas R, 2009, J STRUCT ENG, V135, P386, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2009)135:4(386",24,0,0,6,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This topic involves many physical and mathematical concepts like curl, divergence, gradient for field determination and representation. These concepts are not only difficult to understand but also often lead to poor learning because of the imaginations and non-visualization of electric and magnetic fields. A correct understanding of fields and its distribution is necessary to understand the working, design and optimization of electrical machines. This paper presents a finite element method (FEM) based educational tool that allows the technical students to visualize electromagnetic (EM) fields inside the EM systems. This tool therefore provides a better understanding of the design and optimization of various electrical devices. This paper shows an example of a 2-pole linear machine to visualize the distribution of the magnetic field in a non-linear circuit. This machine extends to form a linear switched reluctance motor (LSRM) using step-by-step design and optimization procedure along with the user guide interface programmed in FEM based ANSYS Maxwell software.

The Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is one of the deep learning architecture that has been applied in the field of image analysis and image classification. In this paper, we proposed a novel emotion learning model with a deep learning network. The aim of the learning model is to reduce the affective gap, that extracts the objects and background features of an image semantically, such as high-level and low-level features. These extracted features accompanied with few others and it is more effective in emotion prediction model based on visual concepts of image, that leads to better emotion recognition performance. For training and testing, the experiment is conducted on IAPS (International Affective Picture System) dataset, the Artistic Photos, and the Emotion-Image dataset. An experimental result shows that the proposed model combines visual-content and low-level features of the image that provides promising results for Affective Emotion Classification task.","[Priya, D.

As the harmonic content increases, higher core loss and eddy current loss in the windings results in higher operating temperatures. It causes magnetic flux density in the core to increase and shifts the operating point through the saturated region. This phenomenon is mostly taught in undergraduate education as theoretical information. However, as a difficult concept to understand, harmonics phenomenon might be taught by using experiments for active learning, visualizing the effects in a laboratory setting, and making the connection between theoretical and practical applications for deeper and meaningful learning. In this study, a teaching method for effects of harmonics is proposed and phase shift between the fundamental and harmonic component of the supply voltage on the transformer B-H characteristic in a laboratory application is introduced by an experimental work performed on toroidal transformers. Feedback from students shows that the proposed method is very efficient and useful for students to better understand the effects of harmonics on the transformer cores.","[Donuk, Atilla] Adnan Menderes Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Aydin, Turkey","Donuk, A (corresponding author), Adnan Menderes Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Aydin, Turkey.",adonuk@adu.edu.tr,,,,,"Al-Haj AH, 2000, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V15, P163, DOI 10.1109/61.84724; Amoiralis EI, 2009, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V24, P1999, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2009.202876; [Anonymous], 2008, C57110 IEEE, VC57, P11; [Anonymous], 2002, C571280 IEEE, VC57, P8; Ayasun S, 2006, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC, V14, P142, DOI 10.1002/cae.2007; BAGHZOUZ Y, 1993, IEEE T POWER SYST, V8, P746, DOI 10.1109/59.26080; Chowdhury AH, 1999, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V14, P450, DOI 10.1109/61.75408; Corona-Sanchez MA, 2017, IEEE T MAGN, V53, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2017.265682; Dayi L, 2009, INT C EL MACH SYST ; Digalovski M, 2013, EUROCO; Gorji Ghalamestani S, 2016, IEEE T MAGN, V52, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2016.251565; Hamad MS, 2012, IET POWER ELECTRON, V5, P1315, DOI 10.1049/iet-pel.2011.037; HSU JS, 1989, IEEE T MAGN, V25, P267; Huang P, 2017, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V64, P4391, DOI 10.1109/TIE.2017.267459; Jimenez-Mondragon VM, 2016, IEEE T MAGN, V52, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2016.258052; Kefalas TD, 2012, IEEE T MAGN, V48, P1609, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2011.217292; Krause TW, 2003, IEEE T MAGN, V39, P562, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2002.80635; Masoum MAS, 2008, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V23, P2033, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2008.92305; Mohammed OA, 2006, IEEE T MAGN, V42, P967, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2006.87246; Pedra J, 2004, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V19, P884, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2004.82525; Pierce LW, 1996, IEEE T IND APPL, V32, P633, DOI 10.1109/28.50217; Prochazka R, 2015, IEEE T MAGN, V51, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2014.235778; Scher AD, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P367, DOI 10.1177/002072091877504; Shameer AK, 2011, IEEE GCC C EXH UN A; Stensland T, 1997, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V12, P768, DOI 10.1109/61.58436; Steurer M, 2002, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V17, P155, DOI 10.1109/61.97420; Terciyanli A, 2010, IEEE EN CONV C EXP ; TranQuoc T, 1997, IEEE T MAGN, V33, P2045, DOI 10.1109/20.58271; Vahidi B, 2005, IEEE T EDUC, V48, P307, DOI 10.1109/TE.2004.84290; Zhang YS, 2016, IEEE T MAGN, V52, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2015.247429",30,3,3,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This article discusses the basic concepts and design of energy storage systems for electricity based transpiration application. The content of this work elaborates the importance of energy storage systems in electric vehicle and hybridization of energy storage systems i.e. battery and ultracapacitor, which seems to be a promising topic among the final-year project students as well as an emerging research topic among the research scholars worldwide. Hence, this article is prepared in order to trigger those students' knowledge in multisourced electric vehicle in depth. This study highly focuses on fuzzy logic-based energy sources power split strategy for a multisourced electric vehicle to enhance a better sharing of energy across the multisources with distinct characteristics like high specific power (ultracapacitor) and high specific energy (battery). In general, fuzzy logic controller best suits for a complicated real-time problem. Further it does not require a priori knowledge of a vehicle driving pattern over a time. Hence, the proposed control strategy can provide a satisfactory improvement in vehicle efficiency, assured reduction in stress factor, and energy consumption rate and reduced ultracapacitor sources state of charge difference in all different hybridization topologies. Thus, this paper can help students working on energy management problems of hybridization of energy sources.","[Geetha, A.; Subramani, C.] SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Kattankulathur 603203, Tamil Nadu, India","Subramani, C (corresponding author), SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Kattankulathur 603203, Tamil Nadu, India.",csmsrm@gmail.com,"C, SUBRAMANI/O-2623-2019","C, SUBRAMANI/0000-0002-3745-2348","SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRM Selective Excellence), Kattankulathur, India","The authors would like to thank SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRM Selective Excellence), Kattankulathur, India for supporting this research work.","Abdelsalam AA, 2012, ENERGIES, V5, P1175, DOI 10.3390/en504117; Akar F, 2013, INT CON ELECTR POWE; Baisden AC, 2004, IEEE T VEH TECHNOL, V53, P199, DOI 10.1109/TVT.2003.82200; Cezar B, 2011, SYST THEOR CONTR COM, P; Chan TD, 2001, MODERN ELECT VEHICL; Ebbesen S, 2012, IEEE T VEH TECHNOL, V61, P2893, DOI 10.1109/TVT.2012.220383; Gao JP, 2009, P I MECH ENG D-J AUT, V223, P1003, DOI 10.1243/09544070JAUTO107; Geetha A, 2017, INT J ENERG RES, V41, P1817, DOI 10.1002/er.373; Gokce K, 2016, INT J ELECTROCHEM SC, V11, P122; Golchoubian P, 2017, IEEE T VEH TECHNOL, V66, P9678, DOI 10.1109/TVT.2017.272530; Hemi H, 2014, ENERG CONVERS MANAGE, V80, P63, DOI 10.1016/j.enconman.2013.12.04; Hochgraf C, 1996, ENGINE CONTROL STRAT, P1; Kamachi M., 2010, POWER ELECT, P2949, DOI DOI 10.1109/IPEC.2010.554201; Krithika V, 2018, INT J ENERG RES, V42, P1789, DOI 10.1002/er.395; Kuperman A, 2011, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V15, P981, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2010.11.01; Li JQ, 2017, ENRGY PROCED, V105, P2705, DOI 10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.92; Lukic SM, 2008, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V55, P2258, DOI 10.1109/TIE.2008.91839; Naseri F, 2017, IEEE T VEH TECHNOL, V66, P3724, DOI 10.1109/TVT.2016.261165; Sanliang Z, 2015, ADV ENERGY MATER, V5, P140140; Shi LW, 2009, ASIA-PAC POWER ENERG, P300; Tie SF, 2013, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V20, P82, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2012.11.07; Trovao JP, 2013, APPL ENERG, V105, P304, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.12.08; Wang H, 2018, IEEE-ASME T MECH, V23, P2609, DOI 10.1109/TMECH.2018.283201; Wu J, 2012, INT J AUTO TECH-KOR, V13, P1159, DOI 10.1007/s12239-012-0119-; Yin H, 2016, IEEE T TRANSP ELECTR, V2, P300, DOI 10.1109/TTE.2016.255272",25,4,4,1,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

For this purpose, the paper presents and analyses a procedure by which the mathematical modelling of a three-phase, four-pole, synchronous machine can be implemented in theLabVIEWenvironment. A suitable graphics user interface is proposed and case studies under different machine operating conditions are shown. The corresponding results illustrate the validity and accuracy of the model. Furthermore, a reactive power PI controller is also implemented. The overall graphics user interface/simulation model is applied to an undergraduate course as a teaching tool and assessed thoroughly.

The inductance is a key design parameter in tracks of electronic devices, power transmission and distribution systems, and lightning, grounding, and bonding systems. Inductance highly relies on the problem geometry, and under AC supply, it is also influenced by skin and proximity effects. The inductance significantly determines voltage drop in conductors, thus increasing reactive power consumption and limiting conductors' ampacity. Although this is an important topic, it is seldom studied in detail in undergraduate and even in graduate physics and engineering studies. To this end, this paper compares the results provided by existing closed formulas for simple conductors' configurations with those attained through two-dimensional finite element method simulations. Finite element method based simulations are increasingly being incorporated in the syllabuses of graduate and undergraduate courses due to their accurate solutions and flexibility, since finite element method models can be applied in a wide range of electrical frequencies and configurations, some of which do not have an analytical solution. The finite element method based approach presented in this paper has been found a valuable complement to the lectures and assignments in electricity courses for engineering students.","[Riba, Jordi-Roger] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Elect Engn, Terrassa, Spain; [Capelli, Francesca] SBI Connectors Spain SAU, St Esteve Sesrovires, Spain","Riba, JR (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Elect Engn, Avda Pla Massa 8, Igualada 08700, Spain.",riba@ee.upc.edu,"Riba, Jordi-Roger/Q-7442-2018","Riba, Jordi-Roger/0000-0001-8774-2389",,,"Aebischer HA, 2014, ADV ELECTROMAGN, V3, P31, DOI 10.7716/aem.v3i1.25; Boyer TH, 2015, AM J PHYS, V83, P263, DOI 10.1119/1.490119; Capelli F, 2017, ELECTR ENG, V99, P827, DOI 10.1007/s00202-016-0455-; Coufal O, 2013, J ENG-NY, V2013, DOI 10.1155/2013/52607; Essen Hanno, 2013, Progress In Electromagnetics Research B, V46, P35; Grigsby LL, 2012, ELECTR POWER ENGN SE, pI; Grover F.

Pitting is the removal of the material in certain part of gear by the application of repeated stresses. Tooth pitting and surface failure occur due to excessive stress conditions. When a number of pits join together, a larger pit is formed, referred as a spall, which may lead to tooth breakage. The early detection and diagnosis of excessive wear tooth pitting and spalling in gear transmission systems are becoming significant concerns in high-speed, large power applications. The early detection of pitting in gears is important from condition monitoring point of view, which is still to be addressed by an experimental approach.

The project is designed by students and teachers .The research shows that the reduction of cross-border time has a positive effect on China's agricultural products export, but the promoting effect is weakened by the negative impact of technical trade measures for agricultural products. Further research shows that the effect of cross-border time reduction on Chinese agricultural products export is heterogeneous. Due to the negative impact of technical trade measures for agricultural products, the cross-border time reduction in developed countries has a strong role in promoting China's agricultural exports; while the cross-border time reduction in non-developed countries has no significant role to promote Chinese agricultural products export, and the technical trade measures involving agricultural product have no inhibiting effect on the promotion of cross-border time reduction. The empirical test also proves the effectiveness of the above research project. Therefore, for the aim to strengthen the export of Chinese agricultural products to the above-mentioned countries, China should not only take advantage of the positive impact of trade facilitation, but also effectively resolve the negative impact of technical trade measures for agricultural products.

The authors developed and analyzed four market models, no IR enter and no brand remanufacture (n), no IR enter and brand remanufacture (nR), IR enter and no brand manufacture (nr), and IR enter and brand remanufacture (nrR). They then analyzed the results using sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis. The research found that new product prices, brand remanufactured product prices, and general re-product prices are positively correlated with brand loyalty; with the increasing level of brand loyalty, brand manufacturers' profit increases, while the IR's profit is lowered. Further, when the manufacturing costs of new products are high, the model preference for the brand manufacturers is always nR > nrR > n > nr; when the costs are lower, the level of the consumer brand loyalty affects the model preference. In models nr and nrR, brand loyalty may increase the brand consumer surplus, but reduces the average consumer surplus, total consumer surplus, and total social welfare.","[Peng, Gao; Jian-Guo, Du; Bin-Xin, Zhu] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Management, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Peng, Gao] Jiangsu Univ Technol, Sch Business, Changzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wei-Dong, Huang] Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Nanjing, Peoples R China","Wei-Dong, H (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Management, Nanjing 210003, Peoples R China.",uangwd@njupt.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71671093]; Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education; Key Research Base of Philosophy and Social Sciences; Jiangsu Province University Philosophy and Social Sciences Outstanding Innovation Team Construction Project; Special Funds of the National Social Science Fund of China [18VSJ038],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Work described in this paper was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71671093.

This paper aims to explore the psychosocial path of people participating in the collective action of NIMBY conflict, and to provide theoretical basis for effective governance of NIMBY conflict. By integrating the psychosocial explanatory variables related to collective action, we construct a regulated double mediation Model, which is empirically tested with 566 questionnaires from the NIMBY conflict in gaoling, China. The results show that: group relative deprivation, group emotions and group effectiveness have positive effects on people's NIMBY conflict participation tendency; group effectiveness and group emotions are important mediating variables of group relative deprivation affecting people's NIMBY conflict participation tendency; group identity has a positive adjustment effect on people's group emotions, group effectiveness, and the participation tendency of NIMBY conflict. The research indicates that group relative deprivation is the key precursor of NIMBY conflict, group emotion is the key factor driving the deterioration of NIMBY conflict, and group identity is the key factor catalyzing the occurrence of NIMBY conflict. This study helps to explain the psychological mechanism of people's participation in NIMBY conflict, and has certain implications for the prevention and governance of NIMBY conflict.","[Guo, Bin] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Publ Adm, Xian 710055, Peoples R China; [Li, KunJi] Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Management, Xian, Peoples R China","Li, KJ (corresponding author), Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Publ Adm, Xian 710055, Peoples R China.",376119298@qq.com,,,,,"Bandura A., 1986, J APPL PSYCHOL, V12, P169, DOI DOI 10.5465/AMR.1987.430653; Chao J, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V2, P7; Gibson CB, 2007, ACAD MANAGE REV, V32, P43; Jia LZ, 2013, J YUNNAN NORMAL U PH, V2, P7; Kakada P, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V1, P4; Kelloway EK, 2008, J APPL PSYCHOL, V93, P806, DOI 10.1037/0021-9010.93.4.80; Kelloway EK, 2007, BASIC APPL SOC PSYCH, V29, P13, DOI 10.1080/0197353070133088; Klandermans B, 2002, POLIT PSYCHOL, V23, P235, DOI 10.1111/0162-895X.0028; Liang HG, 2007, MIS QUART, V31, P5; Mackie DM, 2000, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V79, P602, DOI 10.1037//0022-3514.79.4.60; Mark M.M., 1984, REV PERSONALITY SOCI, V5, P19; Miller DA, 2009, GROUP PROCESS INTERG, V12, P445, DOI 10.1177/136843020910504; Osborne D, 2012, PERS SOC PSYCHOL B, V38, P628, DOI 10.1177/014616721143276; PARCEL TL, 1981, AM J SOCIOL, V86, P1193, DOI 10.1086/22737; Smith HJ, 2012, PERS SOC PSYCHOL REV, V16, P203, DOI 10.1177/108886831143082; van Zomeren M, 2004, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V87, P649, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.87.5.64; van Zomeren M, 2008, PSYCHOL BULL, V134, P504, DOI 10.1037/0033-2909.134.4.50; van Zomeren M, 2012, PERS SOC PSYCHOL REV, V16, P180, DOI 10.1177/108886831143083; van Zomeren M, 2009, J SOC ISSUES, V65, P645, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-4560.2009.01618.; Wang EP., 2012, LEADERSHIP SCI, V1, P; Wohl MJA, 2015, PERS SOC PSYCHOL B, V41, P714, DOI 10.1177/014616721557672; WRIGHT SC, 1990, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V58, P994, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.58.6.99",22,0,0,14,46,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Based on Amartya Sen's theory of capability, this paper selects part-time farmers' six welfare functional activities after rural land transfer, including family economic status, social security, health and leisure, social demand, psychological condition and occupational status. A multidimensional welfare measure model of having uneven distribution sensitive and satisfying Subgroup Conformance and path independence is used to measure the part-time farmers' welfare changes after rural land transfer. The results show that the comprehensive welfare level of part-time farmers has improved before and after rural land transfer. From the sub dimension index, the welfare level of family economic situation, psychological condition and occupational status has increased obviously, the change of social security welfare level is not significant, the welfare level of health and leisure and social demand has declined, and the welfare loss of various dimensions is increased, which indicates that the welfare distribution of part-time farmers after rural land transfer is more unbalanced. Therefore, it is suggested that the welfare level of the part-time farmers can be improved by improving the rural social security, increasing the training of farmers' employment knowledge, and providing non-agricultural employment opportunities, thus promoting the sustainable development of rural land transfer.","[Bin, Guo; He, Dongliang] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Management, Xian, Peoples R China","He, DL (corresponding author), Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Xian 710055, Peoples R China.",hedl@live.xauat.edu.cn,,,,,"Berenger V, 2007, WORLD DEV, V35, P1259, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2006.10.01; Clarke M., 2003, J SOCIO-ECON, V32, P; Ding LI, 2017, POPUL RESOUR ENV CHI, V27, P16; Gao J., 2016, CHINA POPULATION RES, V26, P15; Huang L, 2016, J CARDIOVASC PHARM T, V21, P70, DOI 10.1177/107424841558117; Jia H, 2014, CHINA RURAL OBSERV, V80, P2; KELLEY KC, 1977, J URBAN ECON, V4, P379, DOI 10.1016/0094-1190(77)90001-; Lelli S., 2001, CES DISCUSSION PAPE; Mohaqeqi Kamal SH, 2020, J INT COMP SOC POLIC, V31, P271, DOI [10.1080/21699763.2015.1095580, DOI 10.1080/21699763.2015.1095580; Nordhaus W, 1972, NATL BUREAU EC RES G, V96, P; Robeyns I, 2003, FEM ECON, V9, P61, DOI 10.1080/135457002200007802; Sen A, 2002, FREEDOM DEV, P15; Tommaso MLD., 2006, CHILD WORKING PAPERS, Vwp 05_0; UNDP, 1995, HUMAN DEV REPOR; WANG S, 2014, CHIN J POPUL RESOUR, V24, P10; Yang AT, 2012, QUANTITATIVE TECHNIC, V11, P; Yang Mk., 2009, STAT RES, V26, P3; Yu Q, 2011, CHINA RURAL EC, V84, P6; Zhang M., 2017, J NANJING AGR U SOC, V17, P9; Zhou Y, 2014, STATI DECIS, V19, P10",20,1,1,11,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In view of the variety of controllable resources in microgrid, multi-agent microgrid coordination control architecture is used to control the multi-layer coordination of microgrid, and simulation is built to analyze four different scenes. The results show that in the microgrid load, it is found that the valley peak difference is the smallest when both the electric vehicle and the conventional load participate in the demand response (scene 4). In the change of SOC and charge discharge power of battery energy storage system, it is found that four scenes make the energy storage function of low storage and high generation play an effective role. In the economic and environmental benefits of microgrid daily operation, it is found that the daily operation cost and environmental benefits of scene 4 are significantly lower than that of scene 1. Therefore, in this study, the coordinated optimization method of integrating electric vehicle into microgrid based on multi-agent microgrid can effectively solve the coordinated optimization of multi controllable resources of microgrid, and provide experimental basis for the subsequent development and optimization of microgrid.","[Liu, Jijun] Taiyuan Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Taiyuan 030000, Peoples R China","Liu, JJ (corresponding author), Taiyuan Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Taiyuan 030000, Peoples R China.",94582967@qq.com,,,,,"Bogarra S, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDU; Cano ZP, 2018, NAT ENERGY, V3, P279, DOI 10.1038/s41560-018-0108-; Iacobucci R, 2018, ENERGIES, V11, DOI 10.3390/en1108201; Johnson Mark, 2017, Electricity Journal, V30, P12, DOI 10.1016/j.tej.2017.03.01; Khooban MH, 2019, IEEE T INTELL VEHICL, V4, P255, DOI 10.1109/TIV.2019.290441; Khorram-Nia R, 2018, J RENEW SUSTAIN ENER, V10, DOI 10.1063/1.503539; Kirmani S, 2017, INT J RENEW ENERGY R, V7, P196; Lai CM, 2016, ENERGIES, V9, DOI 10.3390/en903018; Lakshminarayanan V, 2019, IEEE T TRANSP ELECTR, V5, P174, DOI 10.1109/TTE.2018.286946; Lee EK, 2016, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V8, DOI 10.3390/su811114; Mumtaz MA, 2019, ELECTRONICS-SWITZ, V8, DOI 10.3390/electronics802018; Riba JR, 2017, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V54, P35, DOI 10.1177/002072091665950; Wang L., 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, p0020720919837856, DOI 10.1177/002072091983785; Wu XH, 2017, J POWER SOURCES, V363, P277, DOI 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.07.08; Yao JW, 2018, ENERGIES, V11, DOI 10.3390/en1112344; Yu L, 2018, ENERGIES, V11, DOI 10.3390/en1110271; Zhang ZY, 2019, J ENG-JOE, P3116, DOI 10.1049/joe.2018.877",17,0,0,1,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

First, social network data are analyzed, which finds that the type of text data marks the majority. By using data mining technology, the raw data of numerous social network users can be obtained. Based on the random walk model, the data information of the text status of social network users is analyzed, and a user personality prediction method integrating multi-label learning is proposed. In addition, the online social network platform Weibo is taken as the research object. The blog information of Weibo users is obtained through crawler technology. Then, the users are labeled in accordance with personality characteristics. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used to evaluate the relation between the user personality characteristics and the user behavior characteristics of the Weibo users. The correlation between the network behaviors and personality characteristics of Weibo users is analyzed, and the scientificity of the prediction method is verified by the Big Five Model of Personality. By applying relevant technologies and algorithms of data mining and deep learning, the learning ability of neural networks on data characteristics can be improved. In terms of performance on analyzing text information of social network users, the user personality prediction method of integrated multi-label learning based on the random walk model has a large advantage. For the problem of personality prediction of social network users, through combining data mining technology and deep neural network technology in deep learning, the data processing results of social network user behaviors are more accurate.","[Zhu, Yu] Inner Mongolia Univ Sci & Technol, Ideol & Polit Educ, Baotou, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China","Zhu, Y (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Univ Sci & Technol, Ideol & Polit Educ, Baotou, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China.",zhuyusyx@sina.com,,,,,"Bell DC, 2017, SOC SCI RES, V62, P350, DOI 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2016.08.01; Bisen SS, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091989419; Chen TY, 2016, ONLINE INFORM REV, V40, P913, DOI 10.1108/OIR-08-2015-026; Chen X, 2016, INTERNET RES, V26, P566, DOI 10.1108/IntR-05-2014-014; Eyo M, 2016, COGENT EDUC, V3, DOI 10.1080/2331186X.2015.112813; Gong JB, 2017, SCI CHINA INFORM SCI, V60, DOI 10.1007/s11432-017-9243-; Guimaraes RG, 2017, IEEE ACCESS, V5, P10805, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.270667; Gulati A, 2017, BMC PULM MED, V17, DOI 10.1186/s12890-017-0393-; Guo LY, 2016, SOC BEHAV PERSONAL, V44, P1661, DOI 10.2224/sbp.2016.44.10.166; Hou J, 2018, FRONT PSYCHOL, V9, DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2018.0054; Huang HJ, 2018, IEEE T VEH TECHNOL, V67, P8549, DOI 10.1109/TVT.2018.285178; Kim J, 2018, ASIAN J COMMUN, V28, P93, DOI 10.1080/01292986.2017.136379; Konate Arouna, 2018, Wuhan University Journal of Natural Sciences, V23, P237, DOI 10.1007/s11859-018-1316-; Koutsoukas A, 2017, J CHEMINFORMATICS, V9, DOI 10.1186/s13321-017-0226-; Liang YJ, 2018, COMMUN NONLINEAR SCI, V57, P439, DOI 10.1016/j.cnsns.2017.10.01; Manjunatha HC, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, DOI 10.1177/002072091989106; Merchant K, 2018, IEEE J-STSP, V12, P160, DOI 10.1109/JSTSP.2018.279644; Nguyen G, 2019, ARTIF INTELL REV, V52, P77, DOI 10.1007/s10462-018-09679-; Phan N, 2016, SOC NETW ANAL MIN, V6, DOI 10.1007/s13278-016-0379-; Shire SY, 2018, AUTISM, V22, P299, DOI 10.1177/136236131667409; Souri A, 2018, HUM-CENT COMPUT INFO, V8, DOI 10.1186/s13673-018-0147-; Tadesse MM, 2018, IEEE ACCESS, V6, P61959, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2018.287650; van Geel M, 2017, PERS INDIV DIFFER, V106, P231, DOI 10.1016/j.paid.2016.10.06; Wang C., 2017, INT J CONTROL AUTOM, V15, P; Zhang WS, 2017, SOFTWARE PRACT EXPER, V47, P1127, DOI 10.1002/spe.248; Zheng Huizhong, 2016, Journal of Jilin University (Science Edition), V54, P561, DOI 10.13413/j.cnki.jdxblxb.2016.03.2",26,3,3,6,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Therefore, the great difference in lifestyles could cause culture shock, which make tourists' trip a relative awful experience, especially in the popular resorts of some countries such as Europe and America, where tips are given whenever there is a service being provided, and this behaviour confused lots of tourists from Asia, Africa or even European countries. Based on decision tree, this study aimed to share troubles of those tourists with needs by taking the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission's database as research's target, thereby analysing factors that may cause variation in tipping rates. Finally, it is found that distance and duration contributed most to trip fare. Also, besides accurately predicting the tip amount, how each factor contributes to the trip needs to be known; thus, linear regression is used to check the validity of the result, and a 14.1% rate of all distance as a fee is achieved.

To start with, the basic principle of fuzzy theory is analyzed, and the focus is on studying the membership function and the lambda-cut-set knowledge. Following that, the fuzzy clustering method and its process are studied. Finally, fuzzy evaluation is used to build the membership function after experiment on the MATLAB platform to evaluate the environmental quality. The fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm is used to realize the target identification of environmental data. In the process of fuzzy clustering, fuzzy evaluation of the seawater quality is realized, and the redundant data of the monitoring station are removed. Through experiment and analysis, experimental results are in line with the practical situations and show a high consistency with the data characteristics. Compared with the traditional clustering algorithm, fuzzy clustering is more suitable for environmental data processing in environmental data research and analysis.","[Li, Yongyi; Yang, Zhongqiang; Han, Kaixu] Beibu Gulf Univ, Qinzhou Key Lab Big Data Resource Utilizat, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Jilin 132013, Jilin, Peoples R China","Li, YY (corresponding author), Beibu Gulf Univ, Qinzhou Key Lab Big Data Resource Utilizat, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Jilin 132013, Jilin, Peoples R China.",zxylyy@yeah.net,,"HAN, Kaixu/0000-0001-5034-1899","Guangxi Higher Education Undergraduate Teaching Reform Project [2019JGB271]; Natural science foundation of Guangxi [2016GXNSFAA380102, 2016GXNSFAA380188]; Junior middle school teacher's basic ability promotion project of Guangxi in 2017 [2017KY0797]; National Social Science Foundation [19XJY015]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the Guangxi Higher Education Undergraduate Teaching Reform Project (Grant: 2019JGB271); Natural science foundation of Guangxi in 2016 (Grant: 2016GXNSFAA380102); Natural science foundation of Guangxi in 2016 (Grant: 2016GXNSFAA380188); Junior middle school teacher's basic ability promotion project of Guangxi in 2017 (Grant: 2017KY0797); and YNational Social Science Foundation in 2019 (Grant: 19XJY015).","Beiza J, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P124, DOI 10.1177/002072091878873; Chenyang S., 2017, THESI; Fan Y, 2018, OCEAN DEV MANAG, V35, P3; Fazhi D, 2019, J COMPUT APPL, V08, P235; Fei S, 2018, MICROELECTRON COMPUT, V35, P1; Feiyue W, 2017, ACTA AUTOM SIN, V43, P111; Linlin X, 2014, J SHENYANG U TECHNOL, V36, P31; Mansheng X, 2015, CONTROL DECIS, V30, P227; Minjie J, 2015, J TAIYUAN U SCI TECH, V36, P6; Panpan Z., 2018, THESI; [唐成华 Tang Chenghua], 2015, [计算机研究与发展, Journal of Computer Research and Development], V52, P71; Wenjing H., 2013, THESI; Xiaopeng Y., 2016, THESI; Xue Z.A., 2016, J HENAN NORMAL U NAT, V44, P13; Yuhong W., 2015, COMPUT SCI, V42, P49; Zhao Z, 2019, MATH PRACT THEORY, V49, P26; Zhenwei L, 2019, MATH PRACT THEORY, V49, P28; Zhiqiang L., 2018, THESI; Zine O, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P3, DOI 10.1177/002072091877504",19,0,0,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The strength and stability of vegetation concrete would be reduced when it is used in areas where freeze-thaw cycles occur frequently. For exploring the changes of structural properties of vegetation concrete under freeze-thaw cycles, an indoor simulation experiment of vegetation concrete samples containing 25 and 30% water content was carried out, so as to test the changes of specimen surface, volume, ultrasonic wave velocity, shearing strength, and microscopic structure. The microstructural parameters were analyzed quantitatively with Image-Pro Plus software. The experimental results indicated that as cycles of freeze-thaw grow, the macroscopic changes of samples included steadily rising surface crack rate, increasing first and then decreasing volume, greatly reducing ultrasonic wave velocity and gradually decreasing shear strength. The inner structure of samples slowly deteriorated from overall dense to dispersed with decreasing cement hydration crystals, pores resulting from dispersion and destruction of bulky grains, higher surface porosity, and smoother particles in microscopic aspect. When compared with samples containing 25% water content, the microstructure of the 30% water content sample was more affected by the freeze-thaw cycle, and its structural weakening effect was more obvious. Reduced cement hydration crystals, lower inter-particle bonding force, and increase in the number of large pores were the main causes of degradation of vegetation concrete structure. Electrical engineering students can refer to the analysis methods in this paper to evaluate the structural performance of any electrical engineering material.","[Gao, Jiazhen; Zhou, Mingtao; Xu, Wennian; Liu, Daxiang; Du, Ying] China Three Gorges Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Geohazards & Ecoenvironm T, Yichang, Peoples R China; [Gao, Jiazhen; Zhou, Mingtao; Xu, Wennian; Liu, Daxiang; Du, Ying] China Three Gorges Univ, Hubei Key Lab Disaster Prevent & Mitigat, Yichang, Peoples R China; [Peng, Songtao] China Three Gorges Univ, Minist Educ, Engn Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Three Gorges Reservoir R, Yichang, Peoples R China; [Shen, Jian] Huadian Tibet Energy Co Ltd, Lhasa, Tibet, Peoples R China","Zhou, MT (corresponding author), China Three Gorges Univ, Yichang 443002, Peoples R China.",zmt@ctgu.edu.cn,,"Gao, Jiazhen/0000-0002-3421-8329","CRSRI Open Research Program [CKWV2017514/KY]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0504902-02]; Research Fund for Excellent Dissertation of China Three Gorges University [2019BSPY007]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51708333, 51678348]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the CRSRI Open Research Program (Grant: CKWV2017514/KY), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant: 2017YFC0504902-02), the Research Fund for Excellent Dissertation of China Three Gorges University (Grant: 2019BSPY007), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants: 51708333, 51678348).","Aldaood A, 2014, COLD REG SCI TECHNOL, V99, P38, DOI 10.1016/j.coldregions.2013.12.00; Beiza J, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P124, DOI 10.1177/002072091878873; Boz A, 2018, COLD REG SCI TECHNOL, V151, P359, DOI 10.1016/j.coldregions.2018.03.02; China Three Gorges University China Renewable Energy Engineering Institute, 2016, CHIN 3 GORG U TECH; He W, 2013, THESI; Ho LS, 2018, CONSTR BUILD MATER, V166, P634, DOI 10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.01.11; Horpibulsuk S, 2010, CONSTR BUILD MATER, V24, P2011, DOI 10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2010.03.01; [侯淑鹏 Hou Shupeng], 2016, [长江科学院院报, Journal of Yangtze River Scientific Research Institute], V33, P12; Hu T, 2017, J ROCK MECH ENG, V36, P20; Liu DX, 2013, ENVIRON EARTH SCI, V69, P161, DOI 10.1007/s12665-012-1944-; Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute, 1999, 2371999 SL NANJ HYD; Naqvi SR, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P140, DOI 10.1177/002072091879010; Romero E, 2008, GEOTECH GEOL ENG, V26, P705, DOI 10.1007/s10706-008-9204-; Tan YZ, 2013, ROCK SOIL MECH, V34, P282; [唐朝生 TANG Chaosheng], 2008, [岩土工程学报, Chinese Journal of Geotechnical Engineering], V30, P56; Xu Q., 2008, THESI; Xu W, 2012, THEORY PRACTICE ECO; [杨悦舒 Yang Yueshu], 2015, [长江科学院院报, Journal of Yangtze River Scientific Research Institute], V32, P5; [叶万军 Ye Wanjun], 2012, [岩石力学与工程学报, Chinese Journal of Rock Mechanics and Engineering], V31, P19; [张齐齐 Zhang Qiqi], 2015, [水文地质工程地质, Hydrogeology & Engineering Geology], V42, P9; Zhao, 2017, RES VEGETATION ECOL; [周明涛 Zhou Mingtao], 2013, [水土保持研究, Research of Soil and Water Conservation], V20, P28",22,0,0,11,36,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

First, based on the Bat Algorithm (BA), transform the problem of the target into the problem of difference between the estimated position and the actual position to establish an iterative optimization model. Then introduce random perturbation factor to improve the search ability of the bat individual; Aiming at BA is easy to fall into local optimum, a Simulate Anneal (SA) algorithm is integrated to improve the classification and search ability of the algorithm.

It is essential to incorporate the speedy remote sensing processing services in an integrated cloud computing architecture. In order to improve the denoising ability of remote sensing image, a new structured dictionary-based method for multispectral image denoising based on cluster is proposed. This method incorporates both the locality of spatial and the correlation across spectrum of multispectral image. Remote sensing image is divided into different groups by clustering, and sparse representation coefficients of spatial and spectral and dictionary is obtained according to the dictionary learning algorithm. After threshold processing, the similar blocks are averaged and realized with multispectral remote sensing image denoising.

Based on the interactive features of gestures, a set of general gesture interaction rules in VR games is established. In the meantime, according to the theoretical basis and the characteristics of VR, a set of general models of VR gesture interaction is designed, the factors affecting the efficiency of VR gesture interaction are studied, and reasonable interaction feedback is designed. By using the computer vision and image processing technology, gesture-based interaction can collect natural gestures, extract gesture features, recognize gesture indications, and respond to the user demands. Also, it can extract the basic gestures from gesture-based interaction in VR, analyze the basic features of gestures and gesture-based interaction in VR games, and describes the gesture features by mathematical vectors and sets. The research results show that the application of gesture feature design method in the game can analyze the factors affecting the interaction efficiency. Also, the usability of the gesture-based interaction designed by the gesture design method is verified by tests. Therefore, the AR&DL platform of AR+DL establishes a learning platform supported by DL and AR technology. The game decision model is used to describe the process of gesture-based interaction in the game, and the factors affecting the interaction efficiency are reduced, which has certain reference and guidance for VR applications using gesture-based interaction.","[Zhang, GuoLong] Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Sch Art & Design, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China","Zhang, GL (corresponding author), Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Sch Art & Design, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.",animo@mail.lzjtu.cn,,,,,"Aspuru-Guzik A, 2018, ACS CENTRAL SCI, V4, P144, DOI 10.1021/acscentsci.7b0055; Aydogan H, 2011, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V48, P294, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.48.3.; Cheng N, 2018, IEEE COMMUN MAG, V56, P26, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2018.170109; Dieck MCT, 2018, CURR ISSUES TOUR, V21, P154, DOI 10.1080/13683500.2015.107080; Efstathiou I, 2018, INTERACT LEARN ENVIR, V26, P22, DOI 10.1080/10494820.2016.127607; Elbamby MS, 2018, IEEE NETWORK, V32, P78, DOI 10.1109/MNET.2018.170026; Fathima SJSA, 2018, J GLOB INF MANAG, V26, P36, DOI 10.4018/JGIM.201810010; Han DI, 2018, J HERIT TOUR, V13, P46, DOI [10.1080/1743873X.2016.1251931, 10.1080/1743873x.2016.1251931; Jahnke I, 2018, HELIYON, V4, DOI 10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e0065; Kim D, 2018, IEEE COMPUT GRAPH, V38, P100, DOI 10.1109/MCG.2018.05349173; Laine TH, 2018, COMPUTERS, V7, DOI 10.3390/computers701001; Litts BK, 2018, GETMOBILE-MOB COMPU, V22, P5, DOI 10.1145/3308755.330875; Mohammadi M, 2018, IEEE COMMUN SURV TUT, V20, P2923, DOI 10.1109/COMST.2018.284434; Moreno-Valenzuela J, 2017, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V54, P319, DOI 10.1177/002072091668910; Nath S., 2018, INTERACTIONS STUD CO, V9, P31; Qiao XQ, 2019, P IEEE, V107, P651, DOI 10.1109/JPROC.2019.289510; Rajeshwari S, 2019, SUMEDHA J MANAGE, V8, P11; Roberto P, 2019, ACM T MULTIM COMPUT, V15, DOI 10.1145/331174; Sural I, 2018, INT J INSTR, V11, P565, DOI 10.12973/iji.2018.11435; Tong H, 2019, ELECT IMAGING, V2019, P17; Wang J, 2019, IEEE COMMUN MAG, V57, P64, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2019.180097; Wang P, 2018, INT J ENV RES PUB HE, V15, DOI 10.3390/ijerph1506120; Yixue Hao, 2018, IEEE Communications Standards Magazine, V2, P66, DOI 10.1109/MCOMSTD.2018.170008; Yusoff Z, 2018, EDUC INF TECHNOL, V23, P393, DOI 10.1007/s10639-017-9610-",24,3,3,4,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Real-time smoke detection via machine-based identification method in the area of surveillance system has been of great advantage in recent era. An effective smoke detection strategy is necessary to avoid the hazard resulting from fire. The conventional smoke detection method lacks in accuracy, therefore, deep learning based smoke detection is adopted for the same purpose. However, a lot of video smoke detection approach involves minimum lighting and it can be required for the cameras to discover the existence of smoke particles in a scene. Eliminating such challenges, our proposed work introduces a novel concept like hybrid reinforcement deep Q learning classifier of smoke detection. This work takes the correct decision about the smoke particles via reinforcement deep Q learning and classifies the smoke particle with the deep convolutional neural network. The proposed real-time algorithm is aimed to provide proper education for the engineers to detect moving objects for the purpose of developing surveillance systems. This method is also helpful for the beginners who have keen interest in the field of deep learning to control fire. Here, to observe the temporal variance of fire smoke, spatial analysis is identified in the present frame and in the subsequence of the video, spatio-temporal analysis has been taken into account. Finally, smoke particles are classified with the novel reinforcement Q learning-based classifier and experimental results show a better performance regarding classification accuracy. So we can detect smoke successfully with the novel method. The main purpose of this work is to describe and formalize a machine learning -based smoke detection algorithm that can be used by students.","[Matlani, Princy; Shrivastava, Manish] Guru Ghasidas Univ, Comp Sci & Engn, Bilaspur 495009, Chhattisgarh, India","Matlani, P (corresponding author), Guru Ghasidas Univ, Comp Sci & Engn, Bilaspur 495009, Chhattisgarh, India.",princy.matlani@gmail.com,,,,,"[Anonymous], 2015, INT J DISTRIBUTED SE, DOI DOI 10.1109/ICCCHINA.2015.744861; Calderara S, 2011, MACH VISION APPL, V22, P705, DOI 10.1007/s00138-010-0272-; Cestari LA, 2005, FIRE SAFETY J, V40, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.firesaf.2004.07.00; Chen TH, 2006, IIH-MSP: 2006 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT INFORMATION HIDING AND MULTIMEDIA SIGNAL PROCESSING, PROCEEDINGS, P42; Favorskaya M, 2015, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V60, P671, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.20; Filonenko A, 2015, KOR-JPN JT WORKS F; Ismail WHW, P 10 INT C UB INF MA, P3; Ko BC, 2011, IEEE T CIRC SYST VID, V21, P1903, DOI 10.1109/TCSVT.2011.215719; Labati RD, 2013, IEEE T SYST MAN CY-S, V43, P1003, DOI 10.1109/TSMCA.2012.222433; Loukas C, 2015, INT J MED ROBOT COMP, V11, P80, DOI 10.1002/rcs.157; Maruta Hidenori, 2009, 2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE 2009), P1904, DOI 10.1109/ISIE.2009.521456; Maruta H, 2013, IEEE IND ELEC, P2372, DOI 10.1109/IECON.2013.669950; Milarcik EL, 2008, FIRE TECHNOL, V44, P337, DOI 10.1007/s10694-008-0046-; Mukilan P, 2014, INT REV COMPUT SOFTW, V9, P63; Pearce DAJ, 2016, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V53, P114, DOI 10.1177/002072091561114; Pundir AS, 2017, FIRE TECHNOL, V53, P1943, DOI 10.1007/s10694-017-0665-; Rafiee A, 2011, 2011 3rd International Conference on Computer Research and Development (ICCRD 2011), P262, DOI 10.1109/ICCRD.2011.576429; Shukla BP, 2009, INT J REMOTE SENS, V30, P9, DOI 10.1080/0143116080222605; Sivabalasundari B., 2019, INT J ELECT ENG ED, V; Tao CY, 2016, 2016 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS - COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY, INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGY, INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION INTEGRATION (ICIICII), P150, DOI [10.1109/ICIICII.2016.0045, 10.1109/ICIICII.2016.68; Tian HD, 2014, INT J COMPUT VISION, V106, P192, DOI 10.1007/s11263-013-0656-; Tung TX, 2011, FIRE SAFETY J, V46, P276, DOI 10.1016/j.firesaf.2011.03.00; Wang HF, 2020, FIRE TECHNOL, V56, P695, DOI 10.1007/s10694-019-00899-; Xie Y, 2007, INT J REMOTE SENS, V28, P2367, DOI 10.1080/0143116070123679; Yang XP, 2010, 2010 IEEE 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS (ICSP2010), VOLS I-III, P389, DOI 10.1109/ICOSP.2010.565718; Ye W, 2015, FIRE SAFETY J, V73, P91, DOI 10.1016/j.firesaf.2015.03.00; Yu CY, 2010, FIRE TECHNOL, V46, P651, DOI 10.1007/s10694-009-0110-; Yuan FN, 2016, INFORM SCIENCES, V372, P225, DOI 10.1016/j.ins.2016.08.04; Yuan FN, 2015, IET IMAGE PROCESS, V9, P849, DOI 10.1049/iet-ipr.2014.103; Yuan FN, 2011, FIRE SAFETY J, V46, P132, DOI 10.1016/j.firesaf.2011.01.00; Zhou ZQ, 2016, FIRE SAFETY J, V85, P50, DOI 10.1016/j.firesaf.2016.08.00",31,1,1,3,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In 3D-integrated circuit fabrication, congestion, and wirelength minimization are challenging processes. To overcome these problems, we proposed a novel optimization approach for useful partitioning, placement, and routing. Our proposed work consists of four significant stages, including partitioning, placement, routing, and fault diagnosis in through silicon via and spare through silicon via allocation. Firstly, the QuadTree partitioning method executed by the partitioning process. QuadTree method partitions the layer into four subdivisions and remains until it finds no space for partitioning. AND logic is proposed to overcome the congestion problem during placement. In the second stage, the functioning of the hybrid particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing algorithm proposed by the placement process. Particle swarm optimization computes fitness function for six constraints, specifically wirelength, area, power, cross talk, temperature, and delay. The simulated annealing places circuits in the specified area with the computed fitness function. In every 45 degrees, Kruskal's based octi-linear Steiner tree algorithm that establishes routes performs the routing by the third stage. In the last stage, fault detection in through silicon via and spare through silicon via allocation processes are executed using the support vector machine algorithm and dedicated switch. Support vector machine classifies the TSV into two, which includes regular and redundant through silicon via. The spare through silicon via allocation performed by using a dedicated switch. Finally, the proposed work evaluated based on metrics such as wire length, area, temperature, delay, and run time.","[Radhakrishnan Nair, Radeep Krishna; Pothiraj, Sivakumar] Kalasalingam Acad Res & Educ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Krishnankoil 626126, Tamil Nadu, India; [Radhakrishnan Nair, T.

Bolt supporting reinforcement works effectively in enhancing the rock in underground engineering. In this study, the roofs made of the horizontally layered rock were simplified to the rock plate structure with two different constrains, and a cusp catastrophe model was established based on the structural mechanics. With the application of the developed cusp catastrophe model, the influences of ratio of span to thickness, the amounts, and the preload of the bolts on the stability of the stratified rock were studied. Findings show that the installation of bolts can increase the anti-bulking capacity of the layered rock. The bolts can change the failure of the layered rock from bulking failure to shear failure. Improving the integrity of the layered rock is also helpful for enhancing the resistance to the bulking instability.","[Du, Ming R.; Jing, Hong W.] China Univ Min & Technol, State Key Lab Geomech & Deep Underground Engn, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Pan, Bing] Power China Huadong Engn Corp Ltd, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Jing, HW (corresponding author), China Univ Min & Technol, State Key Lab Geomech & Deep Underground Engn, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jinghwskl@163.com,,"Jing, Hongwen/0000-0002-4597-2183",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017BSCXA22]; Graduate student scientific research innovation projects in Jiangsu province [KYCX17_1529],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors acknowledge the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2017BSCXA22) and Graduate student scientific research innovation projects in Jiangsu province (KYCX17_1529).","Alejano LR, 2008, INT J ROCK MECH MIN, V45, P899, DOI 10.1016/j.ijrmms.2007.10.00; Chen M, 2007, TUNN UNDERGR SP TECH, V22, P69, DOI 10.1016/j.tust.2006.03.00; Diederichs MS, 1999, INT J ROCK MECH MIN, V36, P97, DOI 10.1016/S0148-9062(98)00180-; Ding SX, 2017, INT J MIN SCI TECHNO, V27, P573, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmst.2017.03.02; Feng Z.

Performance of the power system comprising of conventional sources like hydro and thermal generating units is evaluated by cascaded fuzzy PD-PI controller optimised by grasshopper optimization algorithm. The potential of grasshopper optimization algorithm is validated by comparing with other algorithms. Further, load-frequency response is studied by penetrating solar-thermal and wind power generating units into the recommended system. The power system integrated with renewable sources puts forth a great stability challenge in the wake of high load perturbation. Hence, a robust secondary controller named cascaded fuzzy PD-PI controller is designed by endorsing a profound grasshopper optimization algorithm technique, to tackle this stability challenge. The credibility of the cascaded fuzzy PD-PI controller with/without nonlinearities presented in the system is validated by comparing the results obtained from proportional-integral-derivative and fuzzy-proportional-integral-derivative controllers. Besides this, the performance of the system under highly perturbed step load variation confers the robustness of the proposed method.","[Tripathy, Debasis; Choudhury, N. B.

Solar and wind are readily available sources which will minimize the cost of electricity if implemented properly. Considering the weather and other relevant advantages, solar energy is a favorable option for a particular site. But it is extremely difficult for the implementation of the suggested renewable energy in a site which already has specific resources and existing infrastructure to replace. Several factors should be counted in for the selection and implementation of appropriate renewable source for fulfilling the demand. As a possible energy option, on-grid infrastructure is selected looking at its low necessity of development and hardware cost. This paper aims to impart the detailed designs of alternative energy options that will offset the annual irrigation costs of the Rainbow Youth Golf Education Program in Klamath County. Using simulator, a practical modeling of the system is performed to look at the cost associated with each case. After selecting a combination with the minimum cost, it is shown that the model decreases the irrigation cost compared to previous year. Other technological implications are also evaluated. Finally, worst case scenario is modeled using the simulator to show that even in the bad weather, the site's energy supply model serves well both electrically and economically.","[Hossain, Eklas; Shi, Feng] Oregon Tech, Dept Elect Engn & Renewable Energy, Oregon Renewable Energy Ctr OREC, Klamath Falls, OR USA; [Bayindir, Ramazan] Gazi Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Fac Technol, Ankara, Turkey; [Hossain, Jakir] Khulna Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Khulna, Bangladesh","Hossain, E (corresponding author), Oregon Inst Technol, 3201 Campus Dr, Klamath Falls, OR 97601 USA.",eklas.hossain@oit.edu,"Hossain, Jakir/ABA-1120-2020; Bayindir, Ramazan/A-4595-2018","Hossain, Jakir/0000-0002-6870-9142; Bayindir, Ramazan/0000-0001-6424-0343",,,"Banos R, 2011, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V15, P1753, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2010.12.00; Evans A, 2009, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V13, P1082, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2008.03.00; Frankovic D, 2017, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V54, P189, DOI 10.1177/002072091667364; Hepbasli A, 2008, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V12, P593, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2006.10.00; Hessami MA, 2011, APPL ENERG, V88, P2755, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.12.01; Hossain E., 2016, THESI; Hossain E, 2017, INT J RENEW ENERGY R, V7, P44; Hossain E, 2014, INT J RENEW ENERGY R, V4, P109; Hossain E, 2014, ENERG CONVERS MANAGE, V86, P132, DOI 10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.01; Kabalci E, 2014, INT CONF RENEW ENERG, P880, DOI 10.1109/ICRERA.2014.701651; Katti PK, 2007, RENEW ENERG, V32, P1346, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2006.06.00; Khan MJ, 2005, RENEW ENERG, V30, P835, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2004.09.00; Lee AHI, 2009, RENEW ENERG, V34, P120, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2008.04.01; Lund H, 2007, ENERGY, V32, P912, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2006.10.01; Mahmood ASMA, 2008, 2008 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: ICCIT 2008, VOLS 1 AND 2, P72; Mann K., 2003, EC RENEWABLE HYDROGE, P1; Nema P, 2007, INT C ADV EN SYST IC, P35; Nema P, 2009, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V13, P2096, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2008.10.00; Norian KH, 2014, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V51, P100, DOI [10.7227/IJEEE.51.22, 10.7227/IJEEE.51.2.2; Paatero JV, 2005, WIND ENERGY, V8, P421, DOI 10.1002/we.15; Pinaud BA, 2013, ENERG ENVIRON SCI, V6, P1983, DOI 10.1039/c3ee40831; Sakib N, 2017, INT J RENEW ENERGY R, V7, P39; Varun, 2009, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V13, P2716, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2009.05.00",23,1,1,1,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

First, the image restoration technology is described, as well as its advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. Second, the deep learning algorithm based on artificial neural network is described and analyzed. Finally, the deep learning algorithm is integrated into the digital repair technology, and a mural restoration method based on the generalized regression neural network is proposed. The morphological expansion method and anisotropic diffusion method are used to preprocess the image. The MATLAB software is used for the simulation analysis and evaluation of the image restoration effect. The results show that in the restoration of the original image, the accuracy of the digital image restoration technology is not high. The nontexture restoration technology is not applicable in the repair of large-scale texture areas. The predicted value of the mural restoration effect based on the generalized neural network is closer to the true value. The anisotropic diffusion method has a significant effect on the processing of image noise. In the image similarity rate, the different number of training samples and smoothing parameters are compared and analyzed. It is found that when the value of delta is small, the number of training samples should be increased to improve the accuracy of the prediction value. If the number of training samples is small, a larger value of delta is needed to get a better prediction effect, and the best restoration effect is obtained for the restored image. Through this study, it is found that this study has a good effect on the restoration model of Dunhuang murals. It provides experimental reference for the restoration of later murals.","[She, Wenjing] Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Sch Art & Design, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China","She, WJ (corresponding author), Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Sch Art & Design, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.",shewj@mail.lzjtu.cn,,,key research project of Industrial Green Low Carbon Transformation and Upgrade in Gansu Province in 2019 (Research on Green and Environmentally friendly Heavy Color Pigments production of Digital Improvement) [GGLD-2019-039],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was part of the key research project of Industrial Green Low Carbon Transformation and Upgrade in Gansu Province in 2019 (Research on Green and Environmentally friendly Heavy Color Pigments production of Digital Improvement) (GGLD-2019-039).","Andreotti A, 2018, J ARCHAEOL SCI-REP, V21, P862, DOI 10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.09.00; Arango-Lievano M, 2018, CELL REP, V23, P1045, DOI 10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.11; Bea M, 2017, J ARCHAEOL SCI-REP, V11, P159, DOI 10.1016/j.jasrep.2016.11.02; Cao JF, 2019, HERIT SCI, V7, DOI 10.1186/s40494-019-0281-; Chen GP, 2018, INT ARCH PHOTOGRAMM, V42-3, P1, DOI [10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9575224, 10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-3-W5-1-2018; Fu X.Y., 2017, ISPRS ANN PHOTOGRAMM, VIV-2/W2, P99, DOI DOI 10.5194/ISPRS-ANNALS-IV-2-W2-99-201; Holm A, 2018, TRENDS CELL BIOL, V28, P302, DOI 10.1016/j.tcb.2017.12.00; Inuzuka M, 2017, J INFRARED MILLIM TE, V38, P380, DOI 10.1007/s10762-017-0365-; Kaufman JA, 2017, ECOPSYCHOLOGY, V9, P253, DOI 10.1089/eco.2017.002; Kim G, 2018, J MOD CRAFT, V11, P55, DOI 10.1080/17496772.2018.144081; Lawson ND, 2019, DEV CELL, V49, P655, DOI 10.1016/j.devcel.2019.05.02; Luo G, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P51, DOI 10.1177/002072091878084; Marin B, 2019, STUD CONSERV, V64, P240, DOI 10.1080/00393630.2018.149227; Marsch LA, 2019, PERSONAL DISORD, V10, P33, DOI 10.1037/per000027; Mercuri F, 2017, APPL SCI-BASEL, V7, DOI 10.3390/app710101; Esteve PN, 2018, INT J ARCHIT HERIT, V12, P169, DOI 10.1080/15583058.2017.135694; Pan N, 2017, J CULT HERIT, V27, P80, DOI 10.1016/j.culher.2017.02.01; Sallam A, 2019, SCI REP-UK, V9, DOI 10.1038/s41598-019-40297-; Skinner Cassandra C, 2018, Retin Cases Brief Rep, V12, P257, DOI 10.1097/ICB.000000000000048; Sweeney PW, 2018, SCI REP-UK, V8, DOI 10.1038/s41598-017-19086-; Tong RX, 2019, OPTIK, V199, DOI 10.1016/j.ijleo.2019.16331; Wharton G, 2018, J INST CONSERV, V41, P58, DOI 10.1080/19455224.2017.141714; Winkler EA, 2017, NEUROSURGERY, V81, pN37, DOI 10.1093/neuros/nyx45; Wu TX, 2017, APPL SPECTROSC, V71, P977, DOI 10.1177/000370281666072; Zhang YD, 2017, STUD CONSERV, V62, P384, DOI 10.1080/00393630.2016.118386; Zhou PP, 2019, REMOTE SENS-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/rs1111138; Zimny J, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P142, DOI 10.1177/002072091775095",27,4,4,7,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This issue complicates the process of supply and demand balancing because the electrical energy generated by photovoltaic arrays cannot be directly stored. Energy storage systems provide a solution to this issue by storing the excess energy generated during peak generation time which will be delivered to the grid during peak load, increasing system energy efficiency. In this work, the possibility of utilizing a Megawatt scale energy storage system, such as a battery bank, to improve the efficiency of a proposed 10-MW Biglow Canyon solar array through solar peak shaving is discussed in detail. With an overview of the benefits of peak shaving and a comparative study of energy storage technologies, an assessment of the most suitable commercially available storage systems is broadly discussed in the paper. Three control algorithms based on battery storage, state of charge, and constant output are proposed to balance the difference between generation and usage using appropriate energy storage system. Simulations are performed with System Advisor Model software to gain an insight of the possible losses and to forecast the monthly energy production costs.","[Stephens, Greg; Hossain, Eklas] Oregon Tech, Dept Elect Engn & Renewable Energy, Oregon Renewable Energy Ctr OREC, Klamath Falls, OR USA; [Dieterle, Chris] Portland Gen Elect, Portland, OR USA; [Bayindir, Ramazan] Gazi Univ, Fac Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Ankara, Turkey","Hossain, E (corresponding author), Oregon Inst Technol, 3201 Campus Dr, Klamath Falls, OR 97601 USA.",eklas.hossain@oit.edu,"Bayindir, Ramazan/A-4595-2018","Bayindir, Ramazan/0000-0001-6424-0343",,,"Achuthan K, 2020, IEEE T IND APPL, V56, P1742, DOI 10.1109/TIA.2020.296615; Akhil A.

Wind certainly emerges as one of the most plausible energy sources in modern power generation. However, large-scale wind energy is associated with fluctuations in voltage and power due to its intermittent nature. The proposed pumped hydroelectric energy storage system offers one of the best solutions in solving this problem. It is shown that large-scale integration of wind energy becomes more feasible and efficient when a proper energy storage system is added to achieve appropriate energy charging or discharging. Upon comparing the potential of different storage systems, pumped hydroelectric energy storage is found to be highly promising for wind integration. In order to demonstrate the behavior of the integrated system with respect to time constant and to verify the feasibility of the energy storage in different case studies, simulations are performed in Matlab/Simulink.

Focusing on the construction of smart city, it can reflect the ideal practical effect in many aspects, effectively improve the level of urban development and operation, and also show better in urban planning. Strong influence requires urban planning for adaptive adjustment. This paper from the core of a small wind power system is the grid-connected inverter. According to the main topology of small wind power generation inverter and grid-connected system, a systematic modeling of small wind power generation system is built. In order to make up for the deficiency of the traditional control strategy for small wind power grid-connected inverter, this paper puts forward a fuzzy control and quasi-PR control method to be applied to the synchronization control of grid-connected inverter. The simulation experiment is conducted by using MATLAB/SIMULINK platform, and the test is conducted by means of combining self-designed system hardware circuit, and the results show that compared with the PR method, the grid current synchronization error can be reduced to smaller, adaptability, and anti-disturbance can be greatly improved through the proposed method and, consequently, has a better application value for small wind power grid-connected inverter.","[Cheng, Yan-Ming; Liu, Cheng; Wu, Jing; Lee, Il-Kyoo] Beihua Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Jilin 132021, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Lee, Il-Kyoo] Kongju Natl Univ, Div Elect Elect & Control Engn, Kong Ju, South Korea; [Niu, Jing] Jilin Chem Fiber Grp Co Ltd, Jilin, Jilin, Peoples R China","Liu, C (corresponding author), Beihua Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Jilin 132021, Jilin, Peoples R China.",178971787@qq.com,,,"education department of Jilin Province [JJKH20200044KJ]; Jilin Provincial development and reform Commission [2018C035-1]; Jilin provincial science and technology department [20160101276JC, 20150312040ZG]; Beihua University [201901012]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The paper was supported by the education department of Jilin Province (Grant: JJKH20200044KJ), the Jilin Provincial development and reform Commission (Grant: 2018C035-1), Jilin provincial science and technology department (Grant: 20160101276JC and 20150312040ZG).

However, due to massive topics and posts in social media, and the sparse distribution of complaint-related posts and, manually identifying complaints is inefficient and time-consuming. In this study, we propose a supervised learning method including training samples enlargement and classifier construction. We first identified reliable complaint and noncomplaint samples from the unlabeled dataset by using small labeled samples as training samples. Combining the labeled samples and enlarged samples, classification algorithms support vector machine and k-nearest neighbor were then adopted to build binary classifiers during the classifier construction process. Experimental results indicate the proposed method can identify complaints from social media efficiently, especially when the amount of labeled training samples is small. This study provides an efficient approach for hotel companies to distinguish a certain kind of consumer complaint information from large number of unrelated information in hotel social media.","[Jin, Jiahua] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lu] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Jiangsu Inst Innovat & Dev, Nanjing 210046, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lu] McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, Hamilton, ON, Canada","Lu, L (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Jiangsu Inst Innovat & Dev, Nanjing 210046, Peoples R China.",lulu_altai@yahoo.com,,,Natural Science Foundation of China [71601100]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M631345]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2302018FRF-TP-18-017A1],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant number 71601100], the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [Grant number 2018M631345], and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [Grant number 2302018FRF-TP-18-017A1].","Abrahams AS, 2012, DECIS SUPPORT SYST, V54, P87, DOI 10.1016/j.dss.2012.04.00; Adamopoulos P, 2018, INFORM SYST RES, V29, P612, DOI 10.1287/isre.2017.076; Adeli E, 2019, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V41, P515, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.2018.279447; Almeida TA, 2016, KNOWL-BASED SYST, V108, P25, DOI 10.1016/j.knosys.2016.05.00; Assaf AG, 2015, TOURISM ECON, V21, P761, DOI 10.5367/te.2014.038; Bhardwaj P., 2017, IITM J MANAG IT, V8, P2; Bitner MJ, 2000, J ACAD MARKET SCI, V28, P138, DOI 10.1177/009207030028101; Cheng VTP, 2014, J TRAVEL TOUR MARK, V31, P1, DOI 10.1080/10548408.2014.86169; Combarro EF, 2005, IEEE T KNOWL DATA EN, V17, P1223, DOI 10.1109/TKDE.2005.14; CORTES C, 1995, MACH LEARN, V20, P273, DOI 10.1023/A:102262741141; COVER TM, 1967, IEEE T INFORM THEORY, V13, P21, DOI 10.1109/TIT.1967.105396; Cvelbar LK, 2018, TOURISM ECON, V24, P701, DOI 10.1177/135481661877674; Dumais S., 1998, 7 INT C INF KNOWL M; Fang YH, 2018, INT J ADVERT, V37, P360, DOI 10.1080/02650487.2016.125601; Fung GPC, 2006, IEEE T KNOWL DATA EN, V18, P; Gronroos C., 2013, EUR J MARKETING, V18, P3; Gu B, 2014, PROD OPER MANAG, V23, P570, DOI 10.1111/poms.1204; Guerreiro J, 2017, TOUR MANAG PERSPECT, V24, P151, DOI 10.1016/j.tmp.2017.08.00; Guillet BD, 2016, J TRAVEL TOUR MARK, V33, P783, DOI 10.1080/10548408.2015.106433; Guo YY, 2016, ASIA PAC J TOUR RES, V21, P883, DOI 10.1080/10941665.2015.108074; Han DH, 2015, APPL INTELL, V43, P773, DOI 10.1007/s10489-015-0675-; Hogreve J, 2019, J SERV RES, V2; Huang L, 2012, ASIA PAC J TOUR RES, V17, P615, DOI 10.1080/10941665.2011.63566; Ienco D, 2016, NEUROCOMPUTING, V196, P113, DOI 10.1016/j.neucom.2016.01.08; James TL, 2017, EXPERT SYST APPL, V71, P479, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2016.11.00; John G.H., 1995, P 11 C UNC ART INT ; Kim AJ, 2016, COMPUT HUM BEHAV, V58, P98, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.12.04; Kim I, 2014, ASIA PAC J TOUR RES, V19, P1441, DOI 10.1080/10941665.2013.86658; Lee C.

However, the inability to fully and effectively use emotional information is a problem in present deep learning models. A single Chinese character has different meanings in different words, and the character embeddings are combined with the word embeddings to extract more precise meaning information. In this paper, a single Chinese character and word are used as input units to train. Based on BLSTM, the attention mechanism based on vocabulary semantics in food field is introduced to realize distance-related sequence semantic feature extraction. CNN is used to realize semantic sentiment classification of sequence semantic features. Therefore, a model based on multi-neural network for sentiment information extraction and analysis is proposed. Experiments show that the model has excellent characteristics in sentiment analysis and obtains high accuracy and F value.","[Li, Yong; Jin, Qingyu; Zuo, Min; Li, Haisheng; Yang, Xiaojun; Zhang, Qingchuan; Liu, Xinliang] Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Yong; Zuo, Min] Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Natl Engn Lab Agriprod Qual Traceabil, Beijing, Peoples R China","Zuo, M (corresponding author), Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Beijing 100000, Peoples R China.",zuomin@th.btbu.edu.cn,,"LI, Haisheng/0000-0003-4861-0513; Liu, Xinliang/0000-0003-4397-1969","Key R&D Plan of National Science and Technology Program Application Center [2019YFC1605306]; National Key Research and Development Plan [2016YFD0401205]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61702018, 61877002]; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality [4184084]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Liberal arts and Social Sciences Foundation [17YJCZH007]; General Project of Scientific Research Program of Beijing Education Commission [KM201510011008, SQKM201710011008]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is supported by the Key R&D Plan of National Science and Technology Program Application Center(Grant no: 2019YFC1605306); National Key Research and Development Plan (Grant no: 2016YFD0401205); National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no: 61877002); National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no: 61702018); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality (Grant no: 4184084); MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Liberal arts and Social Sciences Foundation (Grant no: 17YJCZH007); General Project of Scientific Research Program of Beijing Education Commission(Grant no: SQKM201710011008); General Project of Scientific Research Program of Beijing Education Commission (Grant no: KM201510011008).","Araque O, 2017, EXPERT SYST APPL, V77, P236, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2017.02.00; Bahdanau D., 2014, PROC 3 INT C LEARN ; Bengio Y, 2003, J MACH LEARN RES, V3, P1137, DOI 10.1162/15324430332253322; Cai Huiping, 2016, J RES COMPUTER APPL, V33, P290; Chen XX, 2015, PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWENTY-FOURTH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (IJCAI), P123; Chu RH, 2012, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V49, P127, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.49.2.; Chy, 2016, INN SCI ENG TECHN IC, P; Du Chang-shun, 2017, Computer Engineering and Science, V39, P173, DOI 10.3969/j.issn.1007-130X.2017.01.02; Graves A, 2013, 2013 IEEE WORKSHOP ON AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION AND UNDERSTANDING (ASRU), P273, DOI 10.1109/ASRU.2013.670774; Hochreiter S, 1997, NEURAL COMPUT, V9, P1735, DOI 10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.173; Isah H, 2015, SOCIAL MEDIA ANAL P; Kouloumpis E., 2011, ICWSM, V11, P53; Lee HK, 2020, INT J CULT POLICY, V26, P544, DOI 10.1080/10286632.2019.157740; Liu YM, 2015, 8 INT S COMP INT DE; Mikolov T., 2013, 1 INT C LEARN REPR ; Mnih V, 2014, ADV NEURAL INFORM PR, DOI DOI 10.1017/S037346330300239; Pang B, 2002, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2002 CONFERENCE ON EMPIRICAL METHODS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, P79, DOI 10.3115/1118693.111870; Sleiman HA, 2014, IEEE T KNOWL DATA EN, V26, P1544, DOI 10.1109/TKDE.2013.16; Sun SL, 2017, INFORM FUSION, V36, P10, DOI 10.1016/j.inffus.2016.10.00; Tai KS, 2015, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 53RD ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS AND THE 7TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, VOL 1, P155; Turney PD, 2002, 40TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS, PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCE, P41; Wang H., 2012, P ACL 2012 SYST DE; Zhao G, 2017, J INFORM SECUR RES, V3, P16",23,2,2,5,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Two trait-based multimodal recognition system is developed by using biometrics traits like palmprint and face. First, palmprint and face are pre-processed, extracted features and calculated matching score of each trait using correlation coefficient and combine matching scores using t-norm based score level fusion. Face database like Face 94, Face 95, Face 96, FERET, FRGC and palmprint database like IITD are operated for training and testing of algorithm. The results of experimentation show that the proposed algorithm provides the Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR) of 99.7% at False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.1% and GAR of 99.2% at FAR of 0.01% significantly improves the accuracy of a biometric recognition system.

For this reason, this paper proposes an extracurricular sports lifestyle evaluation to college students via an improved ELECTRE method. In the proposed method, three indexes - concordance index, non-concordance index and credibility index - are defined first. Based on these indexes, the preference evaluation matrix is constructed, and consistent credibility, non-consistent credibility and net credibility are computed second. Third, it was sorted for the quality of all alternatives according to the value of group net credibility. In general, the greater the value of the group net credibility of a project, the better the project is. Simulation experiments suggest that this proposed method is feasible and valid. Extracurricular activities for college students take a very important part of university education, and it models their characters, opens up their minds, adventure spirits, strengthens their social connections, improve their comprehensive quality and their personal positive socialization.","[Zhang, Pingping; Cai, Jiyun] North China Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Phys Educ, Tangshan, Peoples R China; [Xing, Lining] Qingdao Hengxing Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Informat, Qingdao, Peoples R China","Xing, LN (corresponding author), Qingdao Hengxing Univ Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China.",xing2999@qq.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [61773120]; Innovation Team of Guangdong Provincial Department of Education [2018KCXTD031],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 61773120) and the Innovation Team of Guangdong Provincial Department of Education (Grant no. 2018KCXTD031).","Ash GI, 2020, CURR SPORT MED REP, V19, P45, DOI 10.1249/JSR.000000000000068; Bourdeau JohnW., 2005, HUM RESO PLANN, V28, P1; D'Amato A, 2008, J MANAGE PSYCHOL, V23, P929, DOI 10.1108/0268394081090440; D'Annunzio-Green N., 2008, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, V20, P807, DOI 10.1108/0959611081089762; Gong D.W., 2016, PERSPECTIVES INNOVAT, V19, P147; Holden SL, 2019, INT J ENV RES PUB HE, V16, DOI 10.3390/ijerph1616282; Lombardo MP, 2018, PLOS ONE, V13, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.020368; Maher J, 2019, J SPORT EXERCISE PSY, V41, pS7; Saaty T.

At present, there are relatively few research data and the research method is relatively single. Therefore, collecting panel data on China's 31 provinces from 2003 to 2016, this paper conducts an empirical analysis on the influence of patent level on outward foreign direct investment via analytical method of equal part linear regression and Grey Computing. By comparing analysis results with the model and the results with conventional linear regression model, the difference of different regression models is observed. Furthermore, the impact of China's patent level on China's inter-provincial outward foreign direct investment is further analyzed.","[Zhu, Yuanbing] Jinan Univ, Sch Int Studies, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xueying; Wang, Gang; Zhong, Zuchang; Zhuang, Meier] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Business, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Wang, G (corresponding author), Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Business, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",13570105916@163.com,,,"Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Project of the Ministry of Education [15YJA630067]; Soft Science Project of the Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province [2015A070704055]; 12th Five-year Plan Program of Philosophy and Social Science in Guangdong Province [GD14CGL11]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673064, 71974039]; National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong [2019A1515011475]; Innovation team project (HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES) of universities in Guangdong [2017WCXTD003]; Guangdong University of Foreign Studies [6]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research is supported by the Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Project of the Ministry of Education (Grant: 15YJA630067), Soft Science Project of the Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province (Grant: 2015A070704055), and the 12th Five-year Plan Program of Philosophy and Social Science in Guangdong Province (Grant: GD14CGL11), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant: 71673064;71974039), the National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong (Grant: 2019A1515011475), Innovation team project (HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES) of universities in Guangdong (Grant: 2017WCXTD003), Regional and national projects of Guangdong University of Foreign Studies in 2018 (Grant: 6).","Chang SC, 2014, GLOBAL ECON REV, V43, P244, DOI 10.1080/1226508X.2014.93067; Cheung YW, 2012, REV INT ECON, V20, P201, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9396.2012.01017.; Gong J., 2014, IND EC REV, V5, P15; Juan L, 2019, 2019 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION, BIG DATA & SMART CITY (ICITBS), P1, DOI 10.1109/ICITBS.2019.0000; Kolstad I, 2012, J WORLD BUS, V47, P26, DOI 10.1016/j.jwb.2010.10.01; Li J, 2016, INT BUS REV, V25, P1010, DOI 10.1016/j.ibusrev.2016.01.00; Luo XY, 2009, J WORLD BUS, V45, P6; Pan WT, 2017, EURASIA J MATH SCI T, V13, P5765, DOI 10.12973/eurasia.2017.01026; Tao T, 2009, REFORM STRATEGY, V25, P15; Yanan H., 2017, SHANGHAI FIN, P1; Yue C., 2018, MODERN BUS TRADE IND, V39, P5; Zhang XX, 2011, EMERG MARK REV, V12, P389, DOI 10.1016/j.ememar.2011.06.00",12,1,1,1,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

A new compensating regular term is designed, which can perform anisotropic and isotropic diffusion in image denoising, thus making up for insufficient diffusion in the total variation model. The algorithm first uses local standard deviation to distinguish neighborhood types. Then, the anisotropic diffusion based on L-1 norm plays the role of edge protection in the strong edge region. The anisotropic and the isotropic diffusion simultaneously exist in the smooth region, so that the weak textures can be protected while overcoming the staircase effect effectively. The simulation experiments show that this method can effectively improve the peak signal-to-noise ratio and obtain the higher structural similarity index and the shorter running time.","[Zhang, Liqiong; Li, Min; Qiu, Xiaohua] Xian High Tech Res Inst, Xian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Liqiong; Qiu, Xiaohua] Engn Univ Peoples Armed Police, Xian, Peoples R China","Zhang, LQ (corresponding author), Xian High Tech Res Inst, Dept Comp, Xian 710025, Peoples R China.",zhanglqwj@163.com,,,,,"[白俊奇 Bai Junqi], 2008, [光学学报, Acta Optica Sinica], V28, P86; Ben Abdallah M, 2016, NEURAL COMPUT APPL, V27, P1273, DOI 10.1007/s00521-015-1933-; Buades A, 2005, PROC CVPR IEEE, P60, DOI 10.1109/cvpr.2005.3; Chen MN, 2021, J MATERN-FETAL NEO M, V34, P1063, DOI 10.1080/14767058.2019.162387; Dabov K, 2007, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V16, P2080, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2007.90123; Draskovic G, 2019, IEEE GEOSCI REMOTE S, V16, P997, DOI 10.1109/LGRS.2018.288927; Duan PH, 2019, IEEE J-STARS, V12, P; Gao TL, 2019, COMPUT APPL MATH, V38, DOI 10.1007/s40314-019-0763-; Gilboa G, 2008, MULTISCALE MODEL SIM, V7, P1005, DOI 10.1137/07069859; Hasan M, 2018, EURASIP J IMAGE VIDE, DOI 10.1186/s13640-018-0264-; He Kun, 2016, Journal of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, V45, P463, DOI 10.3969/j.issn.1001-0548.2016.02.02; Huber R, 2019, NANOSCALE, V11, P5617, DOI 10.1039/c8nr09058; Kumar A, 2019, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V28, P2921, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2019.289266; Ma QT, 2017, MACH VISION APPL, V28, P635, DOI 10.1007/s00138-017-0857-; Nie XL, 2016, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V25, P2620, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2016.255240; Prabusankarlal K.

In early design stages, cost estimation is indispensable for subsequent decision making, but it cannot be accurate owing to the uncertainty associated with decisions that have not been made. This study proposes a Monte Carlo simulation-based method for designers to estimate potential trends in the construction cost of future design developments. The simulation reveals the probability distribution of construction cost via massive sampling over acceptable ranges of cost-affecting factors that have not yet been uncovered in the current design stage. The simulation result can serve as a part of a dashboard that provides guidance to designers for more optimally controlling construction cost.","[Wu, Nan; Shih, Shen-Guan] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, 43,Keelung Rd,Sect 4, Taipei 10607, Taiwan","Wu, N (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, 43,Keelung Rd,Sect 4, Taipei 10607, Taiwan.",archt_wn@qq.com,,,,,"Attia S, 2009, 11 IBPSA BUILD SIM ; Cheng MY, 2010, EXPERT SYST APPL, V37, P4224, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2009.11.08; Cheung FKT, 2012, AUTOMAT CONSTR, V27, P67, DOI 10.1016/j.autcon.2012.05.00; Chong YT, 2009, RES ENG DES, V20, P97, DOI 10.1007/s00163-008-0059-; DOWNS KA, 1992, COMPUT IND ENG, V23, P423, DOI 10.1016/0360-8352(92)90151-; Emsley M.

Keywords retrieved from corpus are often taken to be markers of aboutness in specialized corpus. They may be a guide to the writer's evaluative position. Some of them, when explored in more detail, help to reveal evaluative attitudes. In this study, two corpora (China's news report corpus and America's news report corpus) are built and the computer corpus tool AntConc3.4.3 is used to generate keywords of these two corpora respectively for detailed concordance analysis in order to reveal different attitudes toward Belt and Road project held by these two countries' news media. The findings demonstrate that China's news reports emphasize mutual benefit and reciprocity among the parties involved; while America's news reports emphasize America's worry about China's development because they claim that China poses a threat to America's national status and interests. This study can help readers understand different news media' attitudes toward the Belt and Road project and help them think in a critical way while they read news reports of the same topic produced by different news media.","[Deng, Fei] South China Agr Univ, Sch Foreign Studies, 483 Wushan Rd, Guangzhou 510642, Peoples R China","Deng, F (corresponding author), South China Agr Univ, Sch Foreign Studies, 483 Wushan Rd, Guangzhou 510642, Peoples R China.",faydra@126.com,,"Deng, Fei/0000-0001-9113-3869", [2018GZYB53],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is funded by the project of the 13th five-year plan for Guangzhou Philosophy and Social Science in 2018 (project number: 2018GZYB53).","Adel A, 2008, STUD CORPUS LINGUIST, V31, P; Baker P., 2006, USING CORPORA DISCO; Biber D, 2007, ENGL SPECIF PURP, V26, P263, DOI 10.1016/j.esp.2006.08.00; Bondi M., 2001, KEYNESS TEXTS, P1, DOI 10.1075/scl.41.01bo; Cheng W., 2008, CORELL COMPUTER RESO, V1, P2; Deng F, 2017, EURASIA J MATH SCI T, V13, P6799, DOI 10.12973/ejmste/7827; Hunston S., 2011, CORPUS APPROACHES E; L Anthony, 2014, ANTCONC VERSION 3 ; Milizia D., 2010, KEYNESS IN TEXTS, P12; Scott M, 2006, STUD CORPUS LINGUIST, V22, P5; Sinclair J., 1999, CORPUS CONCORDANCE C, P17; Sinclair John, 2003, READING CONCORDANCE; Stubbs M., 2001, WORDS PHRASES CORPU; Stubbs M., 1996, TEXT CORPUS LINGUIS",14,0,0,9,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In this article, we analyze how taking an academic break for a different number of semesters affects students' academic performance in terms of their Grade Point Average. This study is conducted at a university in Korea by analysing academic records of 653 undergraduate students who entered the university from 1998 to 2013. In addition, 101 currently enrolled students were surveyed to collect students' opinions on the effects of academic breaks. We investigate changes in grades before and after a school leave and compare the final grades of students who had academic breaks to students who continued their studies without having any breaks during their undergraduate education.Our results indicate that students' grades improve after coming back to the university from a four or more consecutive semesters break, however their final GPAs did not statistically differ from their peers who studied continuously, this suggests that students should not be afraid of taking longer academic breaks.","[Lenskiy, Artem; Shariat, Raad; Seol, Soonuk] Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Sch Elect Elect & Commun Engn, Cheonan Si, Chungcheongnam, South Korea; [Lenskiy, Artem] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Comp Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Lenskiy, A (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",artem.lenskiy@anu.edu.au,,"Lenskiy, Artem/0000-0002-4745-6756; Shariat, Raad/0000-0001-5735-975X",,,"Balkis M, 2016, EDUC SCI-THEOR PRACT, V16, P1819, DOI 10.12738/estp.2016.6.012; BURLEY H, 2001, COMMUNITY COLL J RES, V25, P76; Carroll HCM, 2010, SCHOOL PSYCHOL INT, V31, P115, DOI 10.1177/014303431036167; Davidson Institute for Talent Development, 2018, CONS YOUR OPT GUID ; DeKalb J., 1999, ED429334 ERI; DesJardins SL, 2006, ECON EDUC REV, V25, P575, DOI 10.1016/j.econedurev.2005.06.00; Enthoven J., 2013, KOREAN STUDENTS BAL; Fitzsimmons W, 2000, TIME OUT BURN OUT N; Flynn M, 2003, TAKING YEA; Heath S, 2007, BRIT J SOCIOL EDUC, V28, P89, DOI 10.1080/0142569060099671; Henning M., 2007, THESI; Hoe ACK, 2013, INT CONF RES INNOV, P544, DOI 10.1109/ICRIIS.2013.671676; Jones A., 2004, REV GAP YEAR PROVIS; Keup J, 2015, J HIGH EDUC, V86, P484, DOI 10.1353/jhe.2015.001; Korean Statistical Information Service (KOSIS), 2019, ACTIVE DUTY MEMBER ; Kori K, IEEE GLOB ENG ED C E, P44; Marburger DR, 2001, J ECON EDUC, V32, P99, DOI 10.2307/118348; Nieman MM, 2013, AFR EDUC RE, V10, P132, DOI 10.1080/18146627.2013.78688; Poole H, 2018, CAN J HIGH EDUC, V48, P14; Tank A., 2017, IS TAKING YEAR COL; Torpey ME., 2009, OCCUP OUTLOOK QUARTE, V53, P1; Ziegler C., 1972, SCH ATTENDANCE FACT",22,0,0,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The proposed pedagogical approach is based on the systematic learning through evidence-based teaching, knowledge mobilization, and research strategies. In our approach, it is recommended to use two platforms, mu Vision (simulator) and one microcontroller (hardware), such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi is a small single-board computer, which can be used as a brain for innovative computing projects, such as network monitoring tool, at a reasonable cost. Arduino is the most popular microcontroller (based on the ATmega328), which is a flexible and easy-to-use device for conducting various embedded systems projects. Those platforms have been used for many embedded systems projects, including home automation, Internet of Things, robots, games, and servers.

However, when the energy is exchanged between AC side and DC side or vice versa, the fluctuation in the capacitor used in deputize unit is unavoidable. The fluctuation in the deputize unit is due to the increase in the total harmonic distortion by the capacitor in the output voltages. This total harmonic distortion is evaded by exploring the deputize unit capacitor voltage mathematically. This paper proposes the enhanced frequency shift carrier modulation in H-bridge multilevel converter to suppress the influence of fluctuation in deputize unit capacitor voltages. Enhanced frequency shift carrier modulation is considered for nonlinear compensation. The principal results of using this enhanced frequency shift carrier modulation improvise the total harmonic distortion in the output voltage of H-bridge multilevel converter. Simulation and experimental results are done using MATLAB/SIMULINK to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","[Yuvaraja, T.; Kumar, K. A.

The study had nine specific objectives and six hypotheses tested at 0.05 level of significance to guide the study. A total of 185 electrical/electronic trade teachers of technical colleges made up of the population for the study. The study adopted correlation research design and the structured questionnaire was used to collect data from the respondent. However, the study found that the electrical/electronic trade teachers experienced high job stress, experienced low satisfaction in their teaching profession and exhibited high job performances. The study found positive correlation between work stress and job satisfaction, between work stress and job performances and between job satisfaction and job performances. It was obtained from the result that age, gender and experience did not statistically influence work stress, job satisfaction and job performances. Meanwhile, the type of teacher significantly influences work stress and job satisfaction. It is recommended that more qualified teachers should be employed for the teachers to be more relieved of their duties which can lead to work stress. Teachers of technical colleges should be motivated and satisfied to ensure more productivity and ensure that effect of work stress is reduced.","[Ogbuanya, Theresa Chinyere; Yekinni, Sunkanmi Afeez] Univ Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria","Yekinni, SA (corresponding author), Univ Nigeria, Ind Tech Educ, Nsukka, Nigeria.",sunkanmi.yekinni.pg81780@unn.edu.ng,"Yekinni, Sunkanmi A./S-7782-2018",,,,"Abd Hamid SR, 2012, AUST J TEACH EDUC, V37, P85, DOI 10.14221/ajte.2012v37n11.; Abdulrauf S., 2012, LAFIAJI J ED SCI TEC, V6, P9; ADAMS JS, 1963, J ABNORM PSYCHOL, V67, P422, DOI 10.1037/h004096; ADAMS JS, 1965, ADV EXP SOC PSYCHOL, V2, P26; Agabi OG, 2005, SCH SO; Ahmad W., 2001, PAKISTAN J ED ISLAMA, V14, P2; Ahmed A., 2013, J BUSINESS MANAGEMEN, V11, P61, DOI DOI 10.9790/487X-116616; Al-Khalefa SM., 1999, THESI; Al-Zawahreh A., 2012, EUROPEAN J EC FINANC, V46, P15; Alam S, 2012, J BUS MANAG, V5, P3; Alighili NE., 2016, THESI; Allison LC., 2008, THESI; Alshallah Sahar, 2004, Radiol Manage, V26, P4; Alvarez HK, 2007, TEACH TEACH EDUC, V23, P1113, DOI 10.1016/j.tate.2006.10.00; Amenger M., 2013, THESI; American Psychological Association, 2009, STRESS IN A; Andrew A., 2017, ASIAN J EC BUSINESS, V5, P1, DOI [10.9734/AJEBA/2017/38396, DOI 10.9734/AJEBA/2017/38396; Anih LU., 2008, INTRO ENG, P15; Anjum Z.U.Z., 2014, INT J EDUC RES, V2, P24; Aronsson G, 1999, J Occup Health Psychol, V4, P152, DOI 10.1037/1076-8998.4.2.15; Babatunde A, 2013, EC INSIGHTS TRENDS C, V65, P7; Bakker AB, 2004, HUM RESOUR MANAGE-US, V43, P83, DOI 10.1002/hrm.2000; Barati A., 2007, THESI; Bardach L, 2018, TEACH TEACH EDUC, V74, P249, DOI 10.1016/j.tate.2018.05.01; BEGLEY TM, 1993, J APPL PSYCHOL, V78, P552, DOI 10.1037/0021-9010.78.4.55; Besmart-Digbori E.D., 2011, P 1 INT TECHN ED EN; Bibou-Nakou I, 1999, SCHOOL PSYCHOL INT, V20, P209, DOI 10.1177/014303439902000200; BILLINGSLEY BS, 1991, J SPEC EDUC, V24, P496, DOI 10.1177/00224669910240040; BILLINGSLEY BS, 1992, J SPEC EDUC, V25, P453, DOI 10.1177/00224669920250040; Bokti NorLiyanaMohd., 2009, J INT SOCIAL RES, V2, P29; Borg M.

To address this shortage, heightening the competences of current electrical engineering students is essential. Although researchers have raised these issues and presented expedient methodologies, they have not enhanced graduation rates because many young students are declining the electrical engineering major due to many factors. Nevertheless, the declining percentage must be addressed in the electrical engineering education system; hence this article implemented a research approval assessment technique to engage electrical engineering students' interest with their major, enhance academic research and professional skills, and excel at their electrical engineering degree in the School of Electrical Engineering at Wuhan University, China. The assessment process assists students in recalling and integrating their interests to fulfill degree requirements and select future research, practicing engineering software, and enhancing the collaborative skills necessary for their future engineering careers. Although many students were involved in research approval assessment process, this article focuses on a Pakistani student's approval process, detailing their topic of Pakistan power sector challenges (ferroresonance presence as high profile challenge), and evaluation results. The results indicated that students' interests not only engage them effectively but also motivate their success.","[Tao, Jinsong; Waqas, Muhammad; Zhang, Xiaoxing; Wang, Zhe; Shu, Yang] Wuhan Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China","Tao, JS (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",jamson_tao@163.com,,,"Education Research Project, Wuhan University [2019JG071]; ISPRS Education and Capacity Building Initiatives 2018 [ECBI-2018-TC1]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Education Research Project, Wuhan University.

However, security and privacy issues still remain as a stringent challenge during service catering. Explicitly, the service utility anomalies are liable to cause severe privacy and security issues in cloud service delivery. So, the overall performance of cloud service consumption and end-user applications' service levels utility is degraded. The open access and distributed nature of the cloud computing is the major reason for its vulnerability to intruders. The security and privacy in cloud services have many challenges and problems still open for research. This paper proposes an intrusion detection method capable of detecting nine categories of attacks in two stages. This paper focuses on establishing a network-based intrusion detection mechanism using machine learning techniques. A model will be constructed with a supervised learning methodology using historical network flowdata and flowdata collected from the Internet.","[Chakravarthi, S.

Based on the two methods of feature translation and potential semantic indexing, two kinds of text clustering experiments were carried out on the background text of multi-language text in English translation, and the recall rate, accuracy rate, and F value were compared. The method based on feature translation is relatively simple and can obviously improve the clustering effect of multilingual text. Due to the time and space complexity of the method itself and other inherent defects, the final result of the method based on potential semantic indexing is unsatisfactory. The richness of samples needs to be further expanded, and it is expected that the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) method will be more fully tested in a high-performance computing environment.

The event tree model is established, and the Bayesian network model is transformed from the event tree model based on the typical fire scenarios in high-rise space. A Bayesian fire risk assessment algorithm for high-rise buildings based on mutual information reliability is proposed. Bayesian network is modified considering the influence of uncertainties. Finally, the modified Bayesian network model is used to calculate the probability of fire developing to different stages, and the estimated value of property loss is used to express the severity of the accident and calculate the fire risk value. The results show that the existence of uncertainties has a significant impact on the results of risk assessment; the quantitative assessment method based on Bayesian network is better than the ETA method based on event tree analysis in dealing with uncertainties and is more suitable for high-rise space fire risk assessment.","[Pei, Jingjing; Wang, Guantao] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Engn & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Pei, JJ (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Engn & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",wkfnsdr85@163.com,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0804900]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (NKPC Grant No. 2017YFC0804900) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.","Ambusaidi MA, 2016, IEEE T COMPUT, V65, P2986, DOI 10.1109/TC.2016.251991; Chiacchio F, 2016, EXPERT SYST APPL, V47, P42, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2015.10.04; de Campos LM, 2006, J MACH LEARN RES, V7, P214; Gola D, 2016, BRIEF BIOINFORM, V17, P293, DOI 10.1093/bib/bbv03; Hu BG., 2017, IEEE T NEUR NET LEAR, V25, P24; Hutter M, 2003, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V17, P103; Li H, 2007, INT S NEUR NET; Li YL, 2016, KSCE J CIV ENG, V20, P309, DOI 10.1007/s12205-015-0233-; [刘飞 Liu Fei], 2017, [西北工业大学学报, Journal of Northwestern Polytechnical University], V35, P87; Meng Q, 2017, INT C INT COMP 1 FE; Moreno-Valenzuela J, 2017, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V54, P319, DOI 10.1177/002072091668910; Mouton AM, 2010, ECOL MODEL, V221, P1995, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2010.04.01; Pederson CL, 2019, SEDIMENTOLOGY, V66, P1989, DOI 10.1111/sed.1256; Selvalakshmi S, 2018, J TROP FOR SCI, V30, P242, DOI 10.26525/jtfs2018.30.2.24225; Shan X, 2017, SCI PROGRAMMING-NETH, V2017, DOI 10.1155/2017/363952; Suzuki J, 2016, ENTROPY-SWITZ, V18, DOI 10.3390/e1804010; Vinodhini G, 2016, J KING SAUD UNIV-COM, V28, P2, DOI 10.1016/j.jksuci.2014.03.02; Wang N, 2017, INT J SYST ASSUR ENG, V9, P1, DOI DOI 10.1109/JPHOT.2017.277624; Xia C, 2018, IJMS, V19, P226; Zhang S, 2020, COMMUNICATIONS NONLI, V1, P8",20,2,2,22,82,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The results show that after RE-Ti compound modification, the distribution and morphology of carbide are improved, and with the Ti increase, the impact toughness significantly increases, and tensile strength has a slight increase, but hardness is almost unchanged. When Ti content is 0.6%, the impact toughness and tensile strength are 14.9 J/cm(2) and 634 MPa, respectively, reaching or approaching to the mechanical properties of the forged Cr12MoV steel.","[Fu, Sijing] Chengdu Technol Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Binghua; Wang, Jing; Cheng, Hong] Chengdu Technol Univ, Sch Mat Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China","Wang, J (corresponding author), Chengdu Technol Univ, Sch Mat Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",Wjcd1994@126.com,,,project of Education Department of Sichuan Provincial Government [14TD0033]; Science & Technology Department of Sichuan Province [2013GZX0157],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This paper was funded by the project of Education Department of Sichuan Provincial Government (14TD0033) and Science & Technology Department of Sichuan Province (2013GZX0157).","[陈静 Chen Jing], 2006, [金属热处理, Heat treatment of metals], V31, P9; FROST RH, 1986, AFS T, V94, P29; Fu Han-guang, 2003, Journal of Iron and Steel Research, V15, P3; Fu HG., 2002, J MAT METALL, V1, P30; Liu HJ, 2017, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V54, P341, DOI 10.1177/002072091769465; Shi W, 2004, 14TH CONGRESS OF INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR HEAT TREATMENT AND SURFACE ENGINEERING, VOLS 1 and 2, PROCEEDINGS, P83; [王静 Wang Jing], 2013, [热加工工艺, Hot Working Technology], V42, P7; [魏代斌 WEI Daibin], 2007, [热加工工艺, Hot Working Technology], V36, P7; [魏代斌 WEI Daibin], 2007, [铸造, Foundry], V56, P109; Wu XF, 2009, DIE MOULD IND, V35, P5; Yu Feng, 2008, Journal of Iron and Steel Research, V20, P1, DOI 10.1016/S1006-706X(08)60257-",11,0,0,4,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The large population is affected by diabetic retinopathy and hence research in the area of automated screening has acquired major research interest in the scientific community. The diagnosing features for diabetic retinopathy comprises of identifying deformations of minute blood vessel in form of exudates and its features occurring in and around the regions of fundus which will result into exudes, hemorrhages, or microaneurysms. This feature is often hard to be classified by naked eyes and need trained personnel for close inspection before making diagnosis. Therefore, a comprehensive machine learning tool is in the demand for automated diabetic retinopathy detection. Neural networks have given promising results in the field of classification. Therefore, we present a hybrid neural network-based method with realistic clinical potential. In this study, we present a neuro-fuzzy technique, which is developed for identification of exudates in retinal images and is utilized for the extraction of essential features from the retinal images of patient's eyeballs. We trained this hybrid neural network base technique over a set of 25,600 training images for color retinal images and tested it over 12,000 testing image set for binocular model. The method achieves an accuracy of 95.4% recognition on non-noisy images and 93% on noisy images; thereby giving a consistency rate of 91% in correspondence with the ophthalmologist.","[Jeyapriya, J.; Umadevi, K.

All over the world there are weather prediction stations to analyze the natural disasters for safeguarding the people before they would get any damage. Cyclone is one of the dangerous natural catastrophes that several researchers have undergone research over it, and many technologies were developed to find accurate results for its prediction. Several algorithms were proposed for classifying the cyclone data in terms of latitude, longitude, wind speed, and pressure. Still, it is a significant challenge for most of the researchers for predicting the accurate measurement and observations for cyclonic data. In this paper, a hybrid model is proposed, which is a combination of Genetic Algorithm and XP boost for predicting cyclone severity. The data are collected from the Bay of Bengal Ocean, which has been used in the proposed model for classification. Simulation results show a better improvement in predicting the tropical cyclone categories by using the proposed model. Furthermore, comparison of other existing algorithms with the proposed technique is also discussed.","[Karthick, S.] SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Dept SWE, Kattankulathur, India; [Malathi, D.] SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Dept CSE, Kattankulathur, India","Karthick, S (corresponding author), SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Software Engn, Kattankulathur 603203, Tamil Nadu, India.",sofkarthik@gmail.com,"S, KARTHICK/Q-5025-2016","S, KARTHICK/0000-0002-5346-2546",,,"Ali MM, 2012, IEEE GEOSCI REMOTE S, V9, P1114, DOI 10.1109/LGRS.2012.219049; Baker A, 2018, EGU GEN ASS C, V20, P1460; Bankert RL, 2002, J APPL METEOROL, V41, P461, DOI 10.1175/1520-0450(2002)041<0461:AAMTET>2.0.CO;; Bhushan R., 2018, J OCEANOGRAPHY MARIN, V9, P15, DOI [10.5897/JOMS2017.0144, DOI 10.5897/JOMS2017.0144; Biswas HR, 2018, INT J CLIMATOL, V38, P2415, DOI 10.1002/joc.534; Chakrabarty H, 2015, INT J COMPUT APPL, V11; Chatzidimitriou Kyriakos, 2005, AM ASS ARTIFICIAL IN, V37, P9; Dare RA, 2011, J CLIMATE, V24, P4570, DOI 10.1175/JCLI-D-10-05006.; Dong X, 2013, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V13, P3211, DOI 10.5194/nhess-13-3211-201; Feng B, 2005, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3497, P39; Geetha A., P 2014 IEEE INT C CO, P; Goswami S, 2018, AIN SHAMS ENG J, V9, P365, DOI 10.1016/j.asej.2016.01.01; Grieger J, 2018, EGU GEN ASS C, V20, P1224; Himadri Chakrabarty C.A., 2013, INT J SCI ENG RES, V4, P131; Hitchens NM, 2012, WEATHER FORECAST, V27, P1580, DOI 10.1175/WAF-D-12-00061.; Jensen TG, 2018, OCEAN DYNAM, V68, P391, DOI 10.1007/s10236-018-1136-; Karthick S., 2018, INT J PURE APPL MATH, V118, P25; Kordmahalleh MM, 2016, GECCO'16: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2016 GENETIC AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION CONFERENCE, P957, DOI 10.1145/2908812.290883; Kossin JP, 2007, TROPICAL CYCLONE STR, DOI [10.21236/ada542357, DOI 10.21236/ADA542357; Lakshmanan V, 2009, J ATMOS OCEAN TECH, V26, P2353, DOI 10.1175/2009JTECHA1257.; Lee RST, 2001, IEEE T SYST MAN CY B, V31, P413, DOI 10.1109/3477.93153; Lekha JS, 2018, J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS, V123, P6330, DOI 10.1029/2018JC01418; Leung Y, 2012, INT J GEOGR INF SCI, V26, P75, DOI 10.1080/13658816.2011.57207; Li XA, 2008, EARTH SCI INFORM, V1, P49, DOI 10.1007/s12145-008-0010-; McGovern A, 2011, DATA MIN KNOWL DISC, V22, P232, DOI 10.1007/s10618-010-0193-; Murugan NS, 2019, CLUSTER COMPUT, V22, P13965, DOI 10.1007/s10586-018-2158-; Murugan NS, 2018, WIRELESS PERS COMMUN, V103, P1353, DOI 10.1007/s11277-018-5513-; Nelson DN., 2013, THESI; Raymer ML, 2000, IEEE T EVOLUT COMPUT, V4, P164, DOI 10.1109/4235.85065; RODGERS KB, 2004, GEOPHYS RES LETT, V3; Rogers RF, 2018, TROP CYCLONE RES REV, V7, P77, DOI 10.6057/2018TCRR02.0; Salmun H, 2015, J MAR SCI ENG, V3, P73, DOI 10.3390/jmse301007; Sharma N, 2013, ATMOS SCI LETT, V14, P187, DOI 10.1002/asl2.43; Sim S, 2018, REMOTE SENS-BASEL, V10, DOI 10.3390/rs1004063; Sivakumar V, 2018, PERS UBIQUIT COMPUT, V22, P951, DOI 10.1007/s00779-018-1136-; Walsh K, 1998, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V39, P199, DOI 10.1023/A:100538712097; Wang Y, 2018, ATMOS RES, V214, P386, DOI 10.1016/j.atmosres.2018.08.01",37,4,4,1,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

For illustration purposes and practicality, it is assumed that the model to be identified is of the first-order plus dead time type. The first method uses a popular graphical technique, which is easy to understand and apply, but inaccurate when the response data are not ideal. The second uses the Nelder-Mead simplex method, which is a more powerful technique and has the added benefit of introducing undergraduate students to the concepts of numerical optimisation. The third uses an integral equation algorithm. The latter two methods, which can be readily extended to other model structures and input types, are also demonstrated using experimental data obtained from a tank level control system.","[Burn, Kevin; Cox, Chris] Univ Sunderland, Fac Engn & Adv Mfg, Sunderland SR6 0DD, Tyne & Wear, England","Burn, K (corresponding author), Univ Sunderland, Fac Engn & Adv Mfg, Sunderland SR6 0DD, Tyne & Wear, England.",kevin.burn@sunderland.ac.uk,,"Burn, Kevin/0000-0002-3571-8448",,,"AHMED S, 1995, PEDIATR SURG INT, V10, P18; Ahmed S., 2010, P 9 IFAC INT S DYN ; Ahmed S, 2008, J PROCESS CONTR, V18, P121, DOI 10.1016/j.jprocont.2007.07.00; Ahmed S, 2007, CONTROL ENG PRACT, V15, P545, DOI 10.1016/j.conengprac.2006.10.00; Arbogast JE, 2007, CHEM ENG COMMUN, V194, P1566, DOI 10.1080/0098644070143223; Balaguer P, 2011, ISA T, V50, P231, DOI 10.1016/j.isatra.2010.11.00; Bi Q, 1999, CONTROL ENG PRACT, V7, P71, DOI 10.1016/S0967-0661(98)00166-; Cox C, 2016, APPL MATH MODEL, V40, P100, DOI 10.1016/j.apm.2015.05.00; Du YY, 2011, APPL MATH MODEL, V35, P594, DOI 10.1016/j.apm.2010.07.00; Kelley CT, 1999, SIAM J OPTIMIZ, V10, P43, DOI 10.1137/S105262349731520; Liu M, 2007, J PROCESS CONTR, V17, P51, DOI 10.1016/j.jprocont.2006.08.00; Liu T, 2013, J PROCESS CONTR, V23, P1597, DOI 10.1016/j.jprocont.2013.08.00; Moisy F., 2014, EZYFIT FREE CURVE F; NELDER JA, 1965, COMPUT J, V7, P308, DOI 10.1093/comjnl/7.4.30; NISHIKAWA Y, 1984, AUTOMATICA, V20, P321, DOI 10.1016/0005-1098(84)90047-; Oldenbourg R.C., 1948, DYNAMICS AUTOMATIC ; Panda RC, 2011, ISA T, V50, P529, DOI 10.1016/j.isatra.2011.06.00; RAKE H, 1980, AUTOMATICA, V16, P519, DOI 10.1016/0005-1098(80)90075-; Reyhanoglu, 2010, CONTROL HD; STEN JW, 1970, INSTR TECHNOL, V17, P3; The MathWorks Inc, 2017, MATHWORKS DOC FMIN; Wang QG, 2001, AUTOMATICA, V37, P377, DOI 10.1016/S0005-1098(00)00177-; WRIGHT RG, 2010, MINN DEPT NA RESOUR, P27; YOUNG P, 1980, AUTOMATICA, V16, P281, DOI 10.1016/0005-1098(80)90037-; Zhu Y., 2001, MULTIVARIABLE SYSTE; Ziegler J.G., 1942, Transactions of the ASME, V64, P75",27,1,1,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In order to well understand the electrical characteristics of the pneumatic actuation of the plasma and the influence of the actuation voltage amplitude and the phase on the induced flow characteristics, the dielectric barrier discharge actuators symmetrically distributed were selected for the experimental research. The experiment result shows that the discharge form of the actuators symmetrically distributed is filamentary discharge, uniformly occurring around the high-voltage electrodes, and this is different from the discharge picture of the actuators asymmetrically distributed; when the voltage applied on the high-voltage electrode near to the actuators has the same amplitude and phase, the induced directional jet flow is vertical to the actuator surface, and the speed is at the order of meter per second; the change of the amplitude or phase of the voltage applied on the high-voltage electrode of the actuator can induce a jet flow towards the upper left or the upper right, but cannot effectively increase the induced airflow velocity.","[Ding Jun-liang; Wu Yun; Zhou You-tian] Air Force Engn Univ, Plasma Dynam Lab, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Ding, JL (corresponding author), Air Force Engn Univ, Xian 710038, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",dingdingdang663@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [51336011],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 51336011.","Al-Bashir AK, 2019, NEURAL COMPUT APPL, V31, P1547, DOI 10.1007/s00521-018-3614-; Anghel SD, 2008, PLASMA SOURCES SCI T, V17, DOI 10.1088/0963-0252/17/4/04501; Ashokkumar P, 2018, COMPUT ELECTR ENG, V68, P526, DOI 10.1016/j.compeleceng.2018.05.00; Bayoda KD, 2015, J APPL PHYS, V118, DOI 10.1063/1.492784; Benard N, 2014, EXP FLUIDS, V55, DOI 10.1007/s00348-014-1846-; Elhoseny M, 2018, IEEE ACCESS, V6, P20596, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2018.281761; Gang Zhao, 2010, Proceedings of the 2010 International Conference on Electrical and Control Engineering (ICECE 2010), P3597, DOI 10.1109/iCECE.2010.87; Garg P., 2015, THESI; Gupta D, 2018, COGN SYST RES, V52, P36, DOI 10.1016/j.cogsys.2018.06.00; Hussein AF, 2018, COGN SYST RES, V52, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.cogsys.2018.05.00; Kim BH, 2005, AIAA J, V43, P314, DOI 10.2514/1.1028; Liu X, 2017, ANAL CHEM, V89, P1; Mishra BK, 2017, FLUID MECH FLUID POW, P34; Mohammed MA, 2018, J SUPERCOMPUTING, DOI 10.1007/s11227-018-2587-; Mohammed MA, 2018, COMPUT ELECTR ENG, V71, P212, DOI 10.1016/j.compeleceng.2018.07.05; Mohammed MA, 2018, COMPUT ELECTR ENG, V71, P372, DOI 10.1016/j.compeleceng.2018.07.04; Mohammed MA, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V89, P539, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.07.02; Mutlag AA, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V90, P62, DOI [10.1016/j.future.2018.07.049, DOI 10.1016/J.FUTURE.2018.07.049; Paese E, 2011, J BRAZ SOC MECH SCI, V33, P324, DOI 10.1590/S1678-5878201100030000; Pereira R, 2015, J APPL PHYS, V118, DOI 10.1063/1.493329; Pescini E, 2015, IEEE T PLASMA SCI, V43, P3668, DOI 10.1109/TPS.2015.246101; Thomas FO, 2009, AIAA J, V47, P2169, DOI 10.2514/1.4158; Vardhana M, 2018, COGN SYST RES, V50, P10, DOI 10.1016/j.cogsys.2018.03.00; Wei JL, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V86, P355, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.03.04; WES GWJ, 1990, POWDER TECHNOL, V61, P39, DOI 10.1016/0032-5910(90)80064-",25,1,1,1,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The prototypes of analog and digital fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers are built in the laboratory. These fractional-order PID controllers are applied to linear and nonlinear plants to demonstrate the effectiveness of fractional-order calculus in real time. These experiments are designed, developed, and implemented on the analog and digital platforms. These controllers are integrated to control the DC motor, brushless DC motor, and magnetic levitation modules through hardware-in-loop as well as stand-alone systems. The analog type of fractional-order PID implementation is carried out by using passive components (i.e. resistances and capacitances) with an operational amplifier. However, real-time digital implementation is carried out using field-programmable gate array and digital signal processor. This paper describes how the experiments on fractional calculus can be tailored for graduate, undergraduate students' education and extended for research in this emerging area.","[Khubalkar, Swapnil; Junghare, Anjali; Aware, Mohan] VNIT, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India; [Das, Shantanu] Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India","Khubalkar, S (corresponding author), VNIT, Elect Engn Dept, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India.",swapnilkhubalkar@students.vnit.ac.in,"Aware, Mohan/AAK-8513-2020; Khubalkar, Swapnil W/D-9302-2019; Khubalkar, Swapnil/I-7365-2015","Khubalkar, Swapnil W/0000-0002-7845-3355; Khubalkar, Swapnil/0000-0002-7845-3355",Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences [2012/36/69],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences, project sanction no. 2012/36/69.","Adhikary A., 2017, INA LETT, V2, P41, DOI [10.1007/s41403-017-0020-1, DOI 10.1007/S41403-017-0020-1; Adhikary A, 2016, IEEE T CIRCUITS-I, V63, P1142, DOI 10.1109/TCSI.2016.256826; Alsaedi A, 2015, ADV MECH ENG, V7, DOI 10.1177/168781401561812; Anand S, 2012, IEEE T EDUC, V55, P573, DOI 10.1109/TE.2012.220068; [Anonymous], FUNCTIONAL FRACTIONAL CALCULUS, SECOND EDITIO; Aware MV, 2017, ANALOG INTEGR CIRC S, V91, P131, DOI 10.1007/s10470-016-0920-; Biswas K, 2006, IEEE T CIRCUITS-II, V53, P802, DOI 10.1109/TCSII.2006.87910; Calderon AJ, 2006, SIGNAL PROCESS, V86, P2803, DOI 10.1016/j.sigpro.2006.02.02; Chen X, 2017, IEEE T POWER ELECTR, V32, P7034, DOI 10.1109/TPEL.2016.262878; Chopade AS, 2018, IEEE-CAA J AUTOMATIC, V5, P977, DOI 10.1109/JAS.2016.751018; Chopade AS, 2016, 2016 IEEE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL, MEASUREMENT AND INSTRUMENTATION (CMI), P331, DOI 10.1109/CMI.2016.741376; Debnath L., 2003, INT J MATH MATH SCI, V54, P3413, DOI [10.1155/S0161171203301486, DOI 10.1155/S0161171203301486; Dhabale AS, 2015, ASIAN J CONTROL, V17, P2143, DOI 10.1002/asjc.114; Dimeas I, 2017, AEU-INT J ELECTRON C, V78, P192, DOI 10.1016/j.aeue.2017.03.01; Dwivedi P, 2017, J FRANKLIN I, V354, P7732, DOI 10.1016/j.jfranklin.2017.09.01; Elwakil AS, 2010, IEEE CIRC SYST MAG, V10, P40, DOI 10.1109/MCAS.2010.93863; Estakhrouiyeh MR, 2017, T I MEAS CONTROL, V40, P177; Freeborn TJ, 2015, MATER RENEW SUSTAIN, V4, DOI 10.1007/s40243-015-0052-; Jiang CX, 2007, ADVANCES IN FRACTIONAL CALCULUS, P333, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4020-6042-7_2; Johansson H, 2013, IEEE J EM SEL TOP C, V3, P404, DOI 10.1109/JETCAS.2013.227385; Khanra M, 2013, J FRANKLIN I, V350, P1753, DOI 10.1016/j.jfranklin.2013.05.00; Khubalkar SW, 2016, 2016 IEEE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL, MEASUREMENT AND INSTRUMENTATION (CMI), P326, DOI 10.1109/CMI.2016.741376; Khubalkar S, 2017, TURK J ELECTR ENG CO, V25, P4223, DOI 10.3906/elk-1612-27; Khubalkar S, 2016, CIRC SYST SIGNAL PR, V35, P2189, DOI 10.1007/s00034-016-0262-; Khubalkar SW, 2018, ISA T, V82, P79, DOI 10.1016/j.isatra.2017.08.01; Krishna BT, 2011, SIGNAL PROCESS, V91, P386, DOI 10.1016/j.sigpro.2010.06.02; Muresan CI, 2013, MECHATRONICS, V23, P798, DOI 10.1016/j.mechatronics.2013.04.00; Naumovic MB, 2014, ELECTR ENG, V96, P267, DOI 10.1007/s00202-013-0292-; Ogata K., 1995, DISCRETE TIME CONTR; Oustaloup A, 2000, IEEE T CIRCUITS-I, V47, P25, DOI 10.1109/81.81738; Podlubny I, 1999, IEEE T AUTOMAT CONTR, V44, P208, DOI 10.1109/9.73914; Rapaic MR, 2011, ELECTR ENG, V93, P91, DOI 10.1007/s00202-011-0195-; Swain SK, 2017, AEU-INT J ELECTRON C, V78, P141, DOI 10.1016/j.aeue.2017.05.02; Tenreiro Machado J.

The Internet of Things (IoT), in which objects and objects from active relationships such as sensing, networking and mutual cooperation without human intervention is the core technology of the fourth Industrial Revolution, which can be linked to various industrial fields. As the IoT environment spreads, IoT devices are continuously increasing in various industries. IoT devices connected to the Internet are as different as each application environment. Many information is derived from the interaction between an IoT device and a device or between a human and an IoT device, as well as devices that provide simple data such as sensing. This paper proposes a support method to enable extended service search when users search for services using information generated in IoT environment. The existing service discovery method focuses on the method by which the user selects the service based on the simple service information disclosed by the service provider. In order to solve the problem of existing service discovery method, this study proposed a support method that enables users to search service discovery flexibly even when using existing methods in service discovery in IoT environment. The proposed method provides a user-centered service search environment construction through a search method using user IoT information which was not considered in the existing service search. This makes up for the problem of service availability and provider-oriented service discovery through the establishment of a user service discovery environment.","[Sim, Sungho] Semyung Univ, Sch Informat & Commun Sci, Jecheon, South Korea; [Choi, Hanyong] Shinhan Univ, Div IT Convergence Engn, Dongducheon, South Korea","Choi, H (corresponding author), Shinhan Univ, Div IT Convergence Engn, Dongducheon, South Korea.",hychoi@shinhan.ac.kr,,,,,"Atzori L, 2010, COMPUT NETW, V54, P2787, DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2010.05.01; Bormann C, 2010, IETF J, V; Gubbi J, 2013, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V29, P1645, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2013.01.01; Hai ZG, 2004, J SYST SOFTWARE, V70, P107, DOI [10.1016/S0164-1212(03)00003-7, 10.1016/S0164-1212(02)00003-7; Harshavardhanan P., 2012, COMP COMM INF ICCCI, P; Hyung-Jun Yim, 2014, Journal of KIISE: Computing Practices and Letters, V20, P4; Lee STM, 2016, FRONT MICROBIOL, V7, DOI 10.3389/fmicb.2016.0037; 김미정, 2017, [Korean Computers and Accounting Review, 전산회계연구], V15, P; Object Management Group, 2006, DAT DISTR SERV REA; Platzer C, 2005, Third European Conference on Web Services, Proceedings, P6; Sajjanhar A, 2004, AS PAC WEB C HANGZH, P65; Schmidt E., 2013, NEW DIGITAL AGE, P31; Youngsang K, 2017, KOREA I INFORM TECHN, V15, P; Zanella A, 2014, IEEE INTERNET THINGS, V1, P22, DOI 10.1109/JIOT.2014.230632",14,7,7,1,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Advanced power physics interfacing systems are expected to play a key role within the development of such modern governable and economical large-scale grids and associated infrastructures. Throughout the last era, a worldwide analysis and development interest has been impressed within the field of segmental structure conversion; thanks to the well-known offered blessings over typical solutions within the medium and high voltage and power range. Within the context of battery energy storage systems, the segmental structure conversion device family exhibits a further attraction, i.e., the aptitude of embedding such storage parts in an exceedingly split manner, given the existence of many submodules operative at considerably lower voltages.

This paper presents an instructional approach involving FEM simulations in order to aid in the practical operations on electrical contacts in MV and HV electrical apparatuses effectively. Prior to the completed engineering and scientific work in the field of the electrical apparatuses, constructing the FEM-based model is an effective way to achieve and understand the pros and cons of the experimental solutions. This design method is widely used by the industrial companies and can be implemented as an educational method giving young engineers a new edge. The desired effect of the proposed course was to develop student understanding of electrical contacts engineering by combining the theoretical (simulations) and the practical approach. Ordered creativity was successfully put into practice by checking the parameters derived from the simulations on the real scale layout, which affected and enhanced student confidence in the field and in engineering skills. This instructional approach consisted of two sections (The Theoretical and the Practical) and is essential for understanding and further exploiting the acquired knowledge and certain other measures in engineering work. Moreover, it renders a complete engineering experience employing consequences and their impact on experimental electrical contact research based on multitasking and diversity. The statistical analysis proved that the proposed method had a significant impact and yielded improved results. Moreover, a major improvement in student learning and satisfaction after participating in the proposed course was noted.","[Kolimas, Lukasz; Lapczynski, Sebastian; Szulborski, Michal] Warsaw Univ Technol, Inst Elect Power Engn, Ul Koszykowa 75, PL-00662 Warsaw, Poland","Szulborski, M (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Technol, Inst Elect Power Engn, Ul Koszykowa 75, PL-00662 Warsaw, Poland.",mm.szulborski@gmail.com,"Szulborski, Michał/AHC-9746-2022",,,,"Abdulwahed M, 2014, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC, V22, P110, DOI 10.1002/cae.2053; Bird J., 2003, ELECT CIRCUIT THEOR; Braunovic M, 2010, ELECTR CONTACT, P28; Braunovic M, 2006, SERIES ELECT COMPUTE, P67; Cabecinhas D, 2016, IEEE T CONTR SYST T, V24, P400, DOI 10.1109/TCST.2015.245444; Chou YC., 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V2019, P1, DOI [10.1177/0020720919834669, DOI 10.1177/0020720919834669; Feisel LD, 2005, J ENG EDUC, V94, P121, DOI 10.1002/j.2168-9830.2005.tb00833.; Glennie J., 2012, UNESCO COMMONWEALTH, P1; Guzman JL, 2013, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC, V21, P360, DOI 10.1002/cae.2048; Guzman JL, 2016, IEEE CONTR SYST MAG, V36, P63, DOI 10.1109/MCS.2015.249509; Ionescu CM, 2013, IEEE T EDUC, V56, P436, DOI 10.1109/TE.2013.224951; Jong BS, 2013, IEEE T EDUC, V56, P292, DOI 10.1109/TE.2012.221737; Kuffel E., 2000, HIGH VOLTAGE ENG FU; Li H., 2015, ASSESS EVAL HIGH EDU, V41, P24; Lundquist C, 2013, IEEE T EDUC, V56, P261, DOI 10.1109/TE.2012.221187; Margaryan A., 2008, WORK BASED LEARNIN; Merrill M.

Many studies focus on the process of vacuum application but the process of vacuum removal is generally ignored. Different from observations on surcharge preloading, ground settlement rather than heave occurred during vacuum removal. In this study, a stress-controlled triaxial test was carried out to simulate both processes of vacuum application and removal applied on a clayey soil and hence the mechanism of ground settlement induced by vacuum removal is discussed. Compressive axial strain was observed during the decrease of isotropic stress that simulated vacuum removal. To better understand the observed deformation characteristics of the clayey soils during vacuum removal, in this study, a simple anisotropic elastic model was used. The happening of ground settlement of the clayey soil during vacuum removal is mainly because that the Young's modulus in the vertical direction is higher than that in the horizontal direction. Lateral extension is dominant for the ground deformation during vacuum removal.","[Liu, Jian; Liang, Chuanyang; Wu, Yuedong] Hohai Univ, Geotech Res Inst, Key Lab Minist Educ Geomech & Embankment Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Rui] Harbin Inst Technol, Shenzhen Sch, Shenzhen Key Lab Urban & Civil Engn Disaster Prev, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Mei, Guoxiong] Guangxi Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Key Lab Disaster Prevent & Struct Safety, Minist Educ, Nanning, Peoples R China","Chen, R (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Shenzhen Sch, Shenzhen Key Lab Urban & Civil Engn Disaster Prev, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",chenrui1005@hotmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51608152, 51322807]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2019B73814]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province China [2016A030310368]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0404803]; Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [SJKY19_0449]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors thank for the support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos 51608152 and No. 51322807), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2018b00714 and 2015B25914), the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province China (No. 2016A030310368), National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2017YFC0404803), Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (No. SJKY19_0449) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2019B73814).","[Anonymous], 2007, STANDARD TEST METHO; ASTM, 2017, D431817 ASTM IN; ASTM D2487-11, 2011, D248711 ASTM IN; ATKINSON JH, 1990, GEOTECHNIQUE, V40, P531, DOI 10.1680/geot.1990.40.4.53; Bergado DT, 2002, CAN GEOTECH J, V39, P304, DOI 10.1139/T01-10; Chai JC, 2005, J GEOTECH GEOENVIRON, V131, P1552, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2005)131:12(1552; Chakrabarty J., 2006, THEORY PLASTICIT; Chen R, 2019, EUR J SOIL SCI, V70, P493, DOI 10.1111/ejss.1276; Chen R, 2019, J HYDROL, V568, P260, DOI 10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.10.05; Chu J, 2012, INT J GEOMECH, V5, P15; Holtz RD., 1975, J TRANSPORT RES BOAR, V548, P2; Indraratna B, 2004, CAN GEOTECH J, V41, P1098, DOI [10.1139/t04-054, 10.1139/T04-054; Kianfar K, 2015, CAN GEOTECH J, V52, P2156, DOI 10.1139/cgj-2014-051; Lings ML, 2000, GEOTECHNIQUE, V50, P109, DOI 10.1680/geot.2000.50.2.10; Muir WD., 2004, GEOTECHNICAL MODELL; Noble CA., 2011, CAN GEOTECH J, V3, P3; Noorzad R, 2014, ARAB J GEOSCI, V7, P623, DOI 10.1007/s12517-012-0771-; Pennington DS, 1997, GEOTECHNIQUE, V47, P391, DOI 10.1680/geot.1997.47.3.39; Robinson RG, 2012, CAN GEOTECH J, V49, P729, DOI [10.1139/t2012-024, 10.1139/T2012-024; Samson L, 2011, CAN GEOTECH J, V9, P44; Scher AD, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P367, DOI 10.1177/002072091877504; Schofield AN., 1968, CRITICAL STATE SOI; Shi JW, 2019, COMPUT GEOTECH, V116, DOI 10.1016/j.compgeo.2019.10321; Shi JW, 2019, COMPUT GEOTECH, V106, P108, DOI 10.1016/j.compgeo.2018.10.01; Wang J, 2016, J GEOTECH GEOENVIRON, V142, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.000151; Wu Y, 2016, ENV EARTH SCI, V75, P1, DOI DOI 10.1007/S12665-015-4915-; Wu YD, 2016, J ZHEJIANG UNIV-SC A, V17, P565, DOI 10.1631/jzus.A160023; Yu SY, 2013, INT J NAV ARCH OCEAN, V5, P598, DOI 10.2478/IJNAOE-2013-015",28,0,0,1,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This paper introduces the method of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation to calculate the scores of each student's professional ability and the module of individual professional ability to solve the problem of fuzziness and uncertainty of students' professional ability. However, the calculation process is too complicated to automatically adjust the membership function and fuzzy rules when using fuzzy mathematics to evaluate students' professional ability. In this paper, a new mathematical model of comprehensive evaluation is designed. A combined algorithm-fuzzy neural network algorithm-is proposed by using the advantages of fuzzy analysis and neural network in evaluation; a fuzzy neural network model of college students' professional ability is established.

The gap of traffic resources among different regions will affect the coordinated development of regional economy and widen the gap of wealth among regions. Under the background of emphasizing the coordinated development of regional economy in China, it is particularly important to study the allocation and utilization rate of highway resources in China. Based on the data of 31 provincial administrative regions from 2000 to 2014, this paper combines the Dagum Gini coefficient decomposition method with the extended distribution dynamics model to study the dynamic evolution of regional gap and distribution of highway scale from the perspective of quantity and quality. It is found that the gap of quality is more severe than that of quantity in China. The quality gap between East China and West China is the greatest, while the quantity gap is smaller, which indicates that China should pay attention to the utilization rate of highway resources while emphasizing the rational allocation, and check whether the supply of resources in the regions with busy and developed logistics services meets the demand while promoting economic growth by improving traffic accessibility.","[Sheng, Xin] Jiangsu Open Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Sheng, Xin] Guangzhou Panyu Polytech, Sch Management, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Lin, Xiaoci; Wu, Zeying; Chen, Jiayi; Liu, Biyu; Zhong, Zuchang] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Business, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Deng, Lijun] Fuzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou, Peoples R China","Deng, LJ (corresponding author), Fuzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou, Peoples R China.",dlj7425@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673064]; Innovation team project (HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES) of universities in Guangdong [2017WCXTD003]; Philosophy and Social Sciences in Guangzhou [2018GZGJ194]; Yangcheng young scholars' Foundation [17QNXR12]; Social Sciences Planning Project of the Panyu Polytechnic [2016SK007],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant: 71673064), Innovation team project (HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES) of universities in Guangdong (Grant: 2017WCXTD003), Philosophy and Social Sciences in Guangzhou (Grant: 2018GZGJ194), Yangcheng young scholars' Foundation (Grant: 17QNXR12), Social Sciences Planning Project of the Panyu Polytechnic (Grant: 2016SK007).","Chen F, 2015, ECON GEOGR, V35, P7; Li N, 2010, MODERNIZATION MANAGE, P1; Li YT, 2012, AREAL RES DEV, V31, P14; Li Z.

Conventional gradient-based approaches for target recognition require lot of data to be trained on and require exhaustive training with high computational expense. Hence, when a new condition or untrained data is encountered, such systems inadequately misconfigure newly learned feature sets in the trained model. This misconfigures the structure of re-learned features and is then carried out in subsequent recognition stages. Thus, a development in this scenario with low training time will allow us to fend of this disadvantage. This study presents a new automatic target recognition framework that gives the enhanced performance of target-recognition system when several imaging sensors are connected with one another. This is in contrast with traditional automatic target recognition frameworks, which utilizes one-on-one computational model over synthetic-aperture radar image-processing systems. The work comprises of a learning-based classifications strategy when dealing with sharing of learned parameters over the network to discern critical changes in target-recognition performance by utilizing a novel one-shot learning-based reconfigurable learning network for image processing platform. This upgrades the networked connected CCTV and multiview synthetic-aperture radar image object identification and recognition process.","[Rai, Ankush; Kannan, R.

The trajectory planning strategies of Cartesian space and angular displacement, angular velocity and angular acceleration of three joints in high-speed handling are studied. Firstly, the critical trajectory points starting point and end point, and points for obstacle avoidance height are set up, and then according to the inverse kinematics model of the robot, a point-to-point door type moving trajectory is established, and the mapping relationship between the motion characteristics of the operating space and the motion characteristics of the joint space is established by using the 4-3-4 degree polynomial motion law in the operating space. However, aiming at the higher energy consumption of 4-3-4 degree polynomial interpolation caused by longer the trajectory, and difficult control of obstacle avoidance height, one key point is added. Thereby, the motion rules are interpolated by 4-3-3-4 degree polynomial interpolation, and the mapping relationship between the motion characteristics of the operating space and the motion characteristics of the joint space is established. Two trajectory planning methods are simultaneously simulated under the same keys points and the same trajectory time range. The motion characteristics of the joint rotation angle of the parallel robot between polynomial interpolations are respectively compared. The results show that the trajectory planning method based on 4-3-3-4 degree polynomial interpolation in joint space has obvious advantages in improving the running state of the delta parallel robot and reducing the energy consumption of the system.","[Liu, Cheng; Cao, Guohua] Changchun Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Liu, Cheng; Qu, Yongyin] Beihua Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Jilin, Jilin, Peoples R China","Cao, GH (corresponding author), Changchun Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",bhdqxy@163.com,,,Jilin Provincial Development and Reform Commission [2018C035-1]; Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Talents Team Project [20190101018JH]; Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Department [20160101276JC],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Jilin Provincial Development and Reform Commission (Grant: 2018C035-1), Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Talents & Team Project (Grant: 20190101018JH), and Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Department (Grant: 20160101276JC).","Brogardh T, 2007, ANNU REV CONTROL, V31, P69, DOI 10.1016/j.arcontrol.2007.01.00; Chen Xue-sheng, 2002, Robot, V24, P46; Gasparetto A, 2010, ADV ENG SOFTW, V41, P548, DOI 10.1016/j.advengsoft.2009.11.00; HE P, 2003, ROBOT, V25, P61; [居鹤华 Ju Hehua], 2012, [控制工程, Control Engineering of China], V19, P47; Liu HS, 2013, ROBOT CIM-INT MANUF, V29, P309, DOI 10.1016/j.rcim.2012.08.00; Mei Jiangping, 2016, Journal of Mechanical Engineering, V52, P9, DOI 10.3901/JME.2016.19.00; Moreno-Valenzuela J, 2017, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V54, P319, DOI 10.1177/002072091668910; Wang MM, 2015, ACTA ASTRONAUT, V112, P77, DOI 10.1016/j.actaastro.2015.03.00; Zhou Y, 2012, J SHANGHAI DIANJI U, V15, P23",10,0,0,2,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The size of the material influences the clustering of text by reducing its performance. In this manner, the textual document comprises sparse and uninformative features, and thus raises the computational time and decreases the execution of primary clustering process. Feature selection is a crucial system to choose another subset of instructive text feature to enhance text clustering execution and diminish computational time. The implemented model proposes a 2logmean-particle swarm optimization algorithm for the unstructured text clustering. In this newly proposed technique, all the texts are initially converted into ASCII value, and then by using the particle swarm optimization, the document text is clustered. The outcomes display that clustering accuracy of the implemented method is high compared to the existing K-means algorithm. Furthermore, performances of newly implemented techniques are evaluated concerning scalability, less computation speed with colossal dimensionality reduction.","[Kanimozhi, K., V; Krishnan, Rajakumar] VIT Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Venkatesan, M.] NIT Surathkal, Mangalore, India","Kanimozhi, KV (corresponding author), VIT Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India.",kanimozhi.kv2014@vit.ac.in,,"M, Venkatesan/0000-0002-1651-7093; kanimozhi, k v/0000-0003-4559-2583",,,"Abualigah L.M., 2016, COMPUTER SCI INFORM, P1, DOI [10.1109/CSIT.2016.7549464, DOI 10.1109/CSIT.2016.7549456; Abualigah LM, 2017, J SUPERCOMPUT, V73, P4773, DOI 10.1007/s11227-017-2046-; Bharti KK, 2016, APPL SOFT COMPUT, V43, P20, DOI 10.1016/j.asoc.2016.01.01; Bharti KK, 2014, J COMPUT SCI-NETH, V5, P156, DOI 10.1016/j.jocs.2013.11.00; Bolaji AL, 2016, APPL SOFT COMPUT, V49, P437, DOI 10.1016/j.asoc.2016.08.04; Hong SS, 2015, INT J ADV SOFT COMPU, V7, P2; Kanimozhi K.V., 2015, ADV RES ELECTR ELECT, V2, P5; Kanimozhi KV, 2017, ADV INTELL SYST COMP, V542, P42; Kanimozhi KV, 2018, ADV INTELL SYST COMP, V706, P58; Lin KC, 2016, J SUPERCOMPUT, V72, P3210, DOI 10.1007/s11227-016-1631-; Lu YH, 2015, APPL SOFT COMPUT, V35, P629, DOI 10.1016/j.asoc.2015.07.00; Nasir JA, 2013, KNOWL-BASED SYST, V54, P216, DOI 10.1016/j.knosys.2013.09.01; Nassirtoussi AK, 2015, EXPERT SYST APPL, V42, P306, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2014.08.00; Pinheiro RHW, 2015, EXPERT SYST APPL, V42, P1941, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2014.10.01; Sorzano COS, 2014, SURVEY DIMENSIONALI; Tran T, 2017, CYBERNET SYST, V48, P193, DOI 10.1080/01969722.2016.127677; Wang YW, 2015, KNOWL-BASED SYST, V73, P311, DOI 10.1016/j.knosys.2014.10.01; Zheng L, 2015, SOFT COMPUT, V19, P1567, DOI 10.1007/s00500-014-1307-",18,1,1,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Personality disposition is one of the major factors in developing digital addiction among students from technical discipline. The study aims to explore the predictive ability of personality traits (introversion and emotional intelligence) on internet addiction and the mediating role of the emotional intelligence on the association between introversion and rampant usage of the internet. A sample of 260 students was picked up from engineering colleges with the mean age of 22.3 years. Internet Addiction Test, emotional intelligence questionnaire and McCroskey introversion scale were administered to gather related data. SPSS, structural equation modelling with partial least square and PROCESS macro were used to perform statistical and mediational analyses. The data were analysed with multivariate correlation, hierarchical regression, structural equation modelling and mediational analysis using the bootstrapping method. The results discovered that emotional intelligence and introversion have a noteworthy predictive effect on the level of internet addiction. Mediation analysis shows that emotional intelligence has full mediation effect on the relation between introversion and internet addiction. Excessive internet usage taking a toll on the mental and physical health of engineering students, whereas personality traits are playing a crucial role in developing such a behavioural addiction, and therefore, early detection and prevention is needed urgently.","[Bisen, Shilpa Suresh; Deshpande, Yogesh] Visvesvaraya Natl Inst Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Nagpur 440010, Maharashtra, India; [Haridas, Koustubh] Visvesvaraya Natl Inst Technol, Dept Min Engn, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India","Bisen, SS (corresponding author), Visvesvaraya Natl Inst Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Nagpur 440010, Maharashtra, India.",shilpabisen777@gmail.com,,"Deshpande, Yogesh/0000-0002-7367-6154; bisen, shilpa/0000-0001-6495-7440",,,"Abdollahi A, 2015, SCH MENT HEALTH, V7, P184, DOI 10.1007/s12310-015-9141-; Amichai-Hamburger Y, 2002, CYBERPSYCHOL BEHAV, V5, P125, DOI 10.1089/10949310275377050; Augner C, 2012, INT J PUBLIC HEALTH, V57, P437, DOI 10.1007/s00038-011-0234-; Bar-On R, 2000, BAR EMOTIONAL QUOTI; Bavakutty M., 1999, P 6 NAT CONV AC LIB, P3; Beranuy M, 2009, COMPUT HUM BEHAV, V25, P1182, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2009.03.00; Bessiere Katie, 2010, J Med Internet Res, V12, pe6, DOI 10.2196/jmir.114; Bisen S., 2016, INT J INDIAN PSYCHOL, V4, P7; Bisen SS, 2018, MENT HEALTH REV J, V23, P165, DOI 10.1108/MHRJ-07-2017-002; Brandtzaeg PB, 2012, J COMPUT-MEDIAT COMM, V17, P467, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2012.01580.; Caplan SE, 2005, J COMMUN, V55, P721, DOI 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2005.tb03019.; Casale S, 2013, PERS INDIV DIFFER, V54, P524, DOI 10.1016/j.paid.2012.10.02; Chinyere OT, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDU; Clafferty EM, 2011, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V48, P245, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.48.3.; Douglas AC, 2008, COMPUT HUM BEHAV, V24, P3027, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2008.05.00; Engelberg E, 2004, CYBERPSYCHOL BEHAV, V7, P41, DOI 10.1089/10949310432282010; Far N.

However, certain issues still pertain when one tries to develop a hybrid network. A heterogeneous vehicular network is developed with the idea of utilizing the readily available infrastructures such as long-term evolution and dedicated short-range communication, which is economically profitable. We discussed some of the issues that arise when we converge dedicated short-range communication and long-term evolution and addressed certain issues such as creating a link to communicate between two different technologies that can be achieved by considering the baseband implementations of the two technologies in the physical layer and Media Access Control (MAC) levels. The efficiency of the system is observed at three distinguish multimedia transmission where a text file, audio file, and an image file are transmitted and the system's performance is observed by analyzing the bit error rate vs signal-to-noise ratio for each of the files. The results obtained justified that it is possible to create a heterogeneous vehicular network (HetVNet) even with the presence of certain elements diversities in the characteristics of long-term evolution and dedicated short-range communication.","[Chyne, Phidahunlang; Kandar, Debdatta] North Eastern Hill Univ, Dept Informat Technol, Shillong, Meghalaya, India; [Kumar, V.

The most frequently used social sites are Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc. These popular social networks are used by some of the users for abnormal or illegal activities. It is very important and necessary to identify and avoid such illegal activities without harming anyone in the society. In recent decades, social networks are becoming a popular research area for most researchers. Many authors are doing research on social network datasets and proposing various anomaly detection mechanisms to identify anomalous activities in both static and dynamic growing social networks. Various anomaly detection techniques are proposed by the authors to investigate malicious activities in social networks. In general, the process of identifying anomaly activities of the users in the given dataset is called anomaly detection. The anomaly detection in social networks is the process of investigating whether the users of the given social networks are involved in illegal activities or not. In this work, we proposed a most elegant approach to identify the anomalous or outlier users in the given social network. The proposed approach is considering the users participated in multiple communities of social networks. The designed algorithms are implemented and tested in a big data environment three node cluster using open source Hadoop ecosystem tools. Algorithm1 is used to investigate the nodes/users who participated in multiple communities of the given social network's dataset. Algorithm2 takes the set of users participated in multiple communities and apply graph metrics such as degree and community score to predict the users involved in the anomalous activity.","[Manjunatha, H.

The age estimation involves analyzing the facial features and classifying the age in accordance to the extracted feature values. The biometric features such as the facial parts (eye, mouth, chin, forehead, hair), texture, color and shape provide essential aging details. In the proposed method, the fractal features are extracted using fractal directional code method to retain the significant details present in the input image. The fractal features along with the local features are used to train the system. The deep neural network with three layers is used to train the system.

The most commonly used digital filter is FIR filter. FIR filter is mainly used in digital signal processing applications such as speech processing, sonar, radar and digital communication. The FIR filter is used to process the input signals by linear convolution algorithm. It involves series of addition and multiplication operation. So, the primary building block of the FIR filter is considered as multiply-accumulate (MAC) unit. This paper proposed to use novel floating point radix 4 algorithm to multiply the input impulse responses. This algorithm helps to enhance the performance of the filter in terms of speed. Various rounding techniques will be used for the filter accuracy. The output response of the proposed filter will be simulated in the virtual software and hardware environment with the MATLAB software. The brief investigation of the fixed and floating point signal will be discussed.","[Rubia, J. Jency; Kumar, G. A.

Refactoring is an operation used to improve the structure of an existing system by changing its internal structure without affecting its external behavior. Many studies revealed that refactoring is underused by software development team in industry due to its increased effort and lack of knowledge about existing approaches. Thus, a prioritized correction of antipatterns based on relevance of classes, analyzed development history, risk to refactor, minimized code changes, and maintainers context and preferences is needed for good refactoring recommendations. We propose an approach based on filtered relevant classes with generic linkage-based clustering and adapted nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III to find good refactoring recommendations, which maximize the software quality and reduce the refactoring effort. Our approach uses our own node centrality-based sub-graph isomorphism algorithm to dynamically understand the system with good accuracy prior to optimization. Our approach is evaluated on six open-source systems and the results have shown the effectiveness of our approach compared to the other existing ones.","[Sreeji, K.

At the beginning of the self-intellectual test, language proficiency has always been one of the key test subjects, and most of the intelligence tests also need to be tested by language and writing skills. Testing of English language proficiency is inseparable from the real language environment, but testing in a real environment is time-consuming and laborious. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a test method for rapid evaluation of English networks considering non-metric multidimensional scaling. This study aims to improve the platform test system of the current English network test by analyzing the algorithm characteristics of non-metric multidimensional scale and to optimize the existing English network fast test. At the same time, in order to test the applicability of the English network evaluation project under the algorithm characteristics of the non-metric multidimensional scale, some college students were selected for the test. The results of comparative analysis show that the rapid evaluation of English network based on non-metric multidimensional scale has good reliability and validity, which can effectively distinguish the merits of the assessors, and also can well test the students' level.","[Su, Zheqian; Liu, Miao] Changchun Univ Chinese Med, Foreign Language Dept, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Song, Bailin; Jiang, Man] Changchun Univ Chinese Med, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China","Jiang, M (corresponding author), Changchun Univ Chinese Med, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",1463664429@qq.com,,,"National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of People's Republic of China Great Learning, Great Investigation and Great Implementation in TCM Higher Education: Research on the Theory and Practice of the Teaching Reform of New Teacher Inherit [GZ-10]; Scientific Research Project of Jilin Vocational and Technical Education Institute in 2018: Study on New Teacher Inheritance Model in Jilin Higher Vocational Colleges of Traditional Chinese Medicine [2018XHZ024]","The authors acknowledge National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of People's Republic of China Great Learning, Great Investigation and Great Implementation in TCM Higher Education: Research on the Theory and Practice of the Teaching Reform of New Teacher Inheritance Model in Universities of Chinese Medicine (Grant: GZ-10); Scientific Research Project of Jilin Vocational and Technical Education Institute in 2018: Study on New Teacher Inheritance Model in Jilin Higher Vocational Colleges of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Grant: 2018XHZ024); and Construction Project of Ideological and Political Demonstration Course of Changchun University of Chinese Medicine in 2018.","Asoodar M, 2014, COMPUT EDUC, V70, P291, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2013.08.01; Beiza J, 2019, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V56, P124, DOI 10.1177/002072091878873; Celik S, 2013, COMPUT ASSIST LANG L, V26, P468, DOI 10.1080/09588221.2012.69238; Cheng J, 2015, SPEECH COMMUN, V73, P14, DOI 10.1016/j.specom.2015.07.00; de la Torre EM, 2016, INT SER OPER RES MAN, V239, P145, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4899-7705-2_; Deutsch JL, 2014, STOCH ENV RES RISK A, V28, P707, DOI 10.1007/s00477-013-0783-; Earle S, 2014, RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC, V32, P216, DOI 10.1080/02635143.2014.91312; Le Bagousse S, 2014, J AUDIO ENG SOC, V62, P736, DOI 10.17743/jaes.2014.004; Leu DJ, 2017, J EDUC-US, V197, P; Marcussen C, 2014, TOUR MANAG PERSPECT, V12, P31, DOI 10.1016/j.tmp.2014.07.00; Nicolao M, 2015, INT CONF ACOUST SPEE, P5351, DOI 10.1109/ICASSP.2015.717899; Preedy KF, 2016, THEOR APPL GENET, V129, P2117, DOI 10.1007/s00122-016-2761-; Sagarra M, 2017, OMEGA-INT J MANAGE S, V67, P123, DOI 10.1016/j.omega.2016.04.00; Shih R., 2013, TURKISH ONLINE J ED, V12, P5; Tran VT, 2014, BMC MED, V12, DOI 10.1186/1741-7015-12-10; Woodcock J, 2014, ACTA ACUST UNITED AC, V100, P614, DOI 10.3813/AAA.91874; Woods CT, 2018, J SCI MED SPORT, V21, P410, DOI 10.1016/j.jsams.2017.06.01",17,0,0,3,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In a cognitive network, the secondary transmitter is allowed to access the primary network spectrum when the interference to the primary network is below certain power threshold. While transmitting, the secondary user should cause minimal interference to primary user. So it is inevitable to use a transmit beamformer at the secondary user to focus the beam to desired receiver. A distributed iterative algorithm is formulated through non-cooperative game approach for optimizing the beamforming along with optimum power allocation by maximizing signal to interference ratio of secondary users. This is achieved by deriving an optimal pricing policy for each secondary user, which adapts to the strategies offered by rest of the users, which eventually converges the game into Nash equilibrium. Non-cooperative optimization of transmit power leads to maximization of signal to interference ratio. Subsequently, channel capacity maximization is achieved through water filling algorithm. Through simulations, the effectiveness of the game theory based algorithm is validated and impact of beamforming on signal to interference ratio and system capacity is discussed.

This work deals with design and simulation of closed loop isolated bidirectional dual active bridge DC-DC converter system with current mode control and in addition, cascade filter is implemented to reduce the ripples. The aim of this work is to improve the dynamic response of the closed loop bidirectional dual active bridge DC-DC converter system with two-loop current mode control. Current mode control can be used to improve the output voltage of the bidirectional dual active bridge DC-DC converter system. The proposed converter is initially modeled and simulated with PI-PI controller and latter with PR-PR controller. The dynamic response obtained from the two controllers is analyzed and compared. The results indicate that the dynamic response of the proposed converter is improved by using CM-PR-PR controller. The proposed converter has advantages like reduced settling time and steady state error.","[Janaki, N.; Kumar, R.] Vels Inst Sci Technol & Adv Studies, Elect & Elect Engn, Chennai 600117, Tamil Nadu, India","Janaki, N (corresponding author), Vels Inst Sci Technol & Adv Studies, Elect & Elect Engn, Chennai 600117, Tamil Nadu, India.",janakinarayanan4@gmail.com,,"N, Janaki/0000-0003-4778-4140; , Krishnakumar/0000-0003-2320-093X",,,"Caricchi F, APEC 98 13 ANN APPL, V1, P28; Di Napoli A, 2002, IEEE POWER ELECTRON, P1685, DOI 10.1109/PSEC.2002.102305; Du Y, 2010, APPL POWER ELECT CO, P1145, DOI 10.1109/APEC.2010.543335; Dusmez S, 2015, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V62, P3152, DOI 10.1109/TIE.2015.240482; He PW, 2017, IEEE T TRANSP ELECTR, V3, P147, DOI 10.1109/TTE.2016.263092; Jalbrzykowski S, 2011, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V58, P3879, DOI 10.1109/TIE.2010.210033; Onar OC, 2012, IEEE T VEH TECHNOL, V61, P2018, DOI 10.1109/TVT.2012.219245; Park IG, 1998, IEEE T IND APPL, V34, P1147, DOI 10.1109/28.72045; Park J, 2014, IEEE T POWER ELECTR, V29, P3748, DOI 10.1109/TPEL.2013.228182; Pires VF, 2018, IEEE T IND APPL, V54, P274, DOI 10.1109/TIA.2017.274892; Schupbach RM, 2003, IEEE IEMDC'03: IEEE INTERNATIONAL ELECTRIC MACHINES AND DRIVES CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-3, P1369, DOI 10.1109/IEMDC.2003.121063; Xiao HF, 2008, IEEE T POWER ELECTR, V23, P813, DOI 10.1109/TPEL.2007.91518; Xu AG, 2009, IEEE T POWER ELECTR, V24, P1233, DOI 10.1109/TPEL.2008.201173; Zahid ZU, 2015, IEEE T TRANSP ELECTR, V1, P232, DOI 10.1109/TTE.2015.247603; Zhao B, 2012, IEEE T POWER ELECTR, V27, P4172, DOI 10.1109/TPEL.2012.218958",15,0,0,4,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

However, in courses related to digital communications or signal processing usually these simulations cannot be easily applied to real data or in real scenarios. This limitation does not allow the students to verify that the learned theoretical hypotheses are valid in practice. Nowadays, software defined radio platforms have been proposed to validate theoretical telecommunications concepts in real situations. Therefore, by combining a software defined radio and simulation tools, students can implement the learned notions over real data in real scenarios. This allows students to work under real applications in order to learn by experience and to see that the theoretical concepts are valid in the real world. This paper presents a project involving real-time decoding of automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) signals, implemented by using a universal software radio peripheral software defined radio and MATLAB (R). The universal software radio peripheral allows to receive real automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast signals sent by the aircraft. Then, by using MATLAB (R) tools, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast baseband signals are decoded. The students are guided through a manual to demodulate the real automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast signals and display in a map the aircraft trajectories. The evaluation is based on a competition between the students, considering execution time of their algorithms, and a final report of the project. This project allows to obtain a game-oriented and novel approach for teaching digital communications and signal processing. The implementation of this project in telecommunications engineering courses motivate the students, allowing them to understand better difficult theoretical concepts, and improve their computer, teamwork, and collaboration skills. The originality of the approach is based on the usage of a prototyping platform, combined with simulation tools, for practical application of telecommunications engineering concepts using real signals.","[Poveda, Hector] Univ Tecnol Panama, Fac Ingn Elect, Panama City, Panama; [Ferre, Guillaume; Tajan, Romain] Bordeaux Inst Technol, ENSEIRB MATMECA, Talence, France","Poveda, H (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Panama, Panama City, Panama.",hector.poveda@utp.ac.pa,,,"National Bureau of Science, Technology and Innovation of Panama through the project RAPIDO-5G [ITE15-021]; Sistema Nacional de Investigacion [SNI 153-2017]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is partially supported by the National Bureau of Science, Technology and Innovation of Panama through the project RAPIDO-5G (ITE15-021) and the Sistema Nacional de Investigacion (SNI 153-2017).","Abdulaziz A., 2015, AM J SIGNAL PROCESSI, V5, P2; [Anonymous], 2011, DO260B RTCA IN; Arpaio M., 2016, IEEE INT FOR RES TEC, P; Balanis C., 2005, ANTENNA THEORY ANAL, P85; El-Hajjar Mohammed, 2014, IEEE Communications Magazine, V52, P194, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2014.681591; Kim Y, 2017, IEEE AERO EL SYS MAG, V32, P52, DOI 10.1109/MAES.2018.16023; Kraszewski D, 1977, J MICROWAVE POWER, V12, P5; Varga M, 2015, 2015 38TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (TSP), P215, DOI 10.1109/TSP.2015.729625; Welch TB, 2012, INT CONF ACOUST SPEE, P2789, DOI 10.1109/ICASSP.2012.628849",9,0,0,2,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Simulation is done for both open and closed loop CBRBIS using PIC and PRC. Simulated result obtained from the simulation reduces the total harmonic distortion of the output from the inverter by using PR controller instead of PI controller in the voltage control loop, and it maximizes the power obtained in the MPPT loop by using PR controller instead of PI controller.

However, the derivation and understanding of it is difficult and there is standard literature that is not consistent and thus increases the difficulties. In order to gain a consistent and vivid derivation of the stress tensor for use in electrical engineering lectures, two common variants are analysed from a didactic as well as scientific point of view. It is shown that one variant is consistent whereas the other one can lead to contradictions in case of materials with permeability gradients and thus is not recommended for lectures. Moreover, the resulting tensors of both variants yield different force distributions. For the consistent variant, methods for clarifying the respective force distribution for use in lectures are derived. Finally, a brief consideration on the experimental provability of the results is carried out.","[Schleicher, A.; Werner, R.] Tech Univ Chemnitz, Saxony, Germany","Schleicher, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Chemnitz, D-09126 Chemnitz, Germany.",andre.schleicher@etzu-chemnitz.de,,,,,"Bermudez A, 2017, IEEE T MAGN, V53, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2016.263331; Chan Man Fong CF, 2003, ADV MATH ENG SCI, P30; Chikazumi S, 1997, PHYS FERROMAGNETISM, V2nd, P36; de Medeiros LH, 1999, IEEE T MAGN, V35, P1215, DOI 10.1109/20.76716; Gerlach W, 1922, Z PHYS, V9, P349, DOI 10.1007/BF0132698; Greiner W, 1991, HYDRODYNAMIK, P6; Henke H., 2015, ELEKTROMAGNETISCHE F, P22; Landau LD, 1984, ELECTRODYNAMICS CONT, P7; Meeker D., 2018, FINITE ELEMENT METH; Muller G, 2009, THEORIE ELEKT MASCHI, P1; Muller-Kirstein HJW., 2004, ELECTRODYNAMICS INTR, P16; Trachanas S., 2018, INTRO QUANTUM PHYS F, P28; [No title captured",13,0,0,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Authentication systems such as Biometric crypto systems, Cancellable templates and Bio-hashing provide a solution for addressing these vulnerabilities. But these systems are vulnerable to the unauthorized access resulting from the spoofed fingerprint templates by the fraudulent users. Hence, it is essential to enhance the features of the existing Biometric fingerprint-based authentication systems. An extensive research has been carried out by various researchers on the existing fingerprint authentication system techniques and it is found that none of them are fully capable of eliminating the security vulnerabilities. Fingerprint authentication system technique based on one time fingerprint template provides a solution for this by generating one time template from the fingerprint features. Although this method addresses vulnerability issues to a certain extent, improvements are highly essential particularly in terms of their security and performance. There are several systems based on finger code, where fingerprint features will be converted into finger code using a circular tessellation technique. Although authentication based on this technique improves security, the possibility of compromising the finger code is a huge threat, which needs to be addressed. In this paper, an innovative model is proposed which generates a secure one time finger code during every user authentication. It is generated using finger code obtained from minutiae vectors using a circular tessellation approach, pseudo-random number generators and timestamp, which are generated during every user transaction session. This unique encoding approach makes it extremely difficult for an unauthorized user to decode the generated finger code that is used for a particular authentication session. Thus, the possibility of compromise of original fingerprint can be avoided and thus security of biometric system can be enhanced. The proposed system also provides better performance in terms of its accuracy, processing speed and complexity.","[Harikrishnan, D.; Kumar, N.

Earlier generation radars used electrical cables to transfer such type of signals, where signal speed and bandwidth are limited.

Here, the difficulty is in developing a collaborative learning algorithm for finding collaborative key points within high-dimensional decision space. In order to overcome such a problem, a gradient-based method is required to enable distributed control and collaborative decision making. Here, at every interval of the sampling time, all the subsystems are optimally synchronized in P population system by multiset-rewriting rules including the effect of symport/antiport systems. This is an interesting technical problem, related to the borderline between universality and non-universality of continuity of distributed coupling of multi-coupled control system.

Students can easily score high assessments in this course, because more of the engineering students are interested in this kind of application-oriented course. Normally, the achievement of students in this course is evaluated based on their summative assessment. Hence, the score of evaluation which obtained by the students in this course oftentimes does not match with the actual quality of the students, especially regarding their practical skill. In this paper, several simple practical assignments were proposed for undergraduate students to complete their assessment in microwave engineering course.","[You, Kok Yeow] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Elect Engn, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia","You, KY (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Engn, Sch Elect Engn, Skudai 81310, Johor, Malaysia.",kyyou@fke.utm.my,,"You, Kok Yeow/0000-0001-5214-7571",,,"Braaten BD, 2010, P 2010 ASEE N MIDW ; Campbell R, 2011, IEEE MICROW MAG, V12, P74, DOI 10.1109/MMM.2011.94059; Gupta KC, 2002, IEEE T MICROW THEORY, V50, P1006, DOI 10.1109/22.98998; Gupta MS, 2008, IEEE MICROW MAG, V9, P134, DOI 10.1109/MMM.2008.92764; Modelski JW, 2008, IEEE MICROW MAG, V9, P16, DOI 10.1109/MMM.2008.92523; Pozar DM., 2001, MICROWAVE EN; You KY, 2015, J TEKNOL, V77, P6; You KY., 2016, 6 REG C ENG ED RCEE, P",8,0,0,2,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

It is important to evaluate if scores in tests are reliable, because it shows if the phenomenon under study is measured with precision and low error, which are necessary conditions for a fair assessment. Thus, an analysis is provided about the scores obtained in the 28 continuous assessment tests taken across seven years. Correlation, corrected correlation and Cronbach's alpha are used as psychometric indicators. Results show that, in general, there is a high correlation in the students' scores among the different assessment tests every year, which let us confirm that they have been correctly set out. Additionally, the results are compared among different years, showing that they are similar in the different cohorts. However, variations have also been observed over the years, with tests with poor correlation. Finally, based on the analysed data, a novel method is proposed to early detect problems in the tests' evaluation before the course ends, by correlating their scores in pairs. A low correlation between two tests in the same year, empirically below 0.2, would imply issues in the evaluation.","[Lopez de Vergara, Jorge E.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Commun Technol, Madrid, Spain; [Olmos, Ricardo] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Psychol, Dept Social Psychol & Methodol, Madrid, Spain","de Vergara, JEL (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Escuela Politecn Super, Dept Tecnol Elect & Comunicac, Calle Francisco Tomas Y Valiente 11, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",jorge.lopez_vergara@uam.es,"de Vergara, Jorge E.

Under these situations, if any Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) node wants to send the emergency data to sink/server, then that node may face harsh traffic load conditions in various routes, therefore many times end-to-end delay occurs while sending emergency data. To find the best optimized possible solution for this problem, we proposed an intelligent self-learning and educating algorithm, which uses reinforcement learning technique, shortest path algorithm along with convex-hull algorithm for creation of safe path (green corridor) to send data packets from any node to sink/server in emergency situation on priority basis. This approach is beneficial for engineers (industry/students) to better deal with real-time emergency situations and education purpose. Mainly our proposed learning algorithm selects certain WSN nodes based upon their link quality and higher residual energy to create safe path (green corridor) for emergency situation. The performance of this learning algorithm has been tested in MATLAB and Contiki Cooja simulator under heavy traffic conditions along with various performance parameters like Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) ratio, end-to-end delay, energy consumption and better throughput. Final result shows that our proposed learning algorithm Wireless Sensor Network - Reinforcement Learning (WSN-RL) performs better than existing Reinforcement Learning based lifetime optimization (RLLO) and Reinforcement Learning based Communication Range Control (RL-CRC) algorithms to achieve the optimum solution for our problem.","[Soni, Santosh] Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya, Dept Informat Technol, SOS Engn & Technol, Bilaspur 495009, India; [Shrivastava, Manish] Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya, Dept CSE, SOS Engn & Technol, Bilaspur, India","Soni, S (corresponding author), Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya, Dept Informat Technol, SOS Engn & Technol, Bilaspur 495009, India.",santoshsoni.77@gmail.com,"Shrivastava, Manish/AAS-6633-2020","SHRIVASTAVA, MANISH/0000-0002-1346-968X",,,"[Anonymous], OPEN SOURC; Atzori L, 2000, COMPUT NETWORKS, V54, P278; Belagra M, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P293, DOI 10.1177/002072091877305; Cerpa A, 2004, IEEE T MOBILE COMPUT, V3, P272, DOI 10.1109/TMC.2004.1; Chang F., 2016, J NETWORK INTELLIGEN, V1, P; Cormen TH, 2009, INTRO ALGORITHM; Dyo V, 2008, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V5067, P478, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-69170-9_3; Egorova-Forster A, 2007, IEEE INT C MOB AD H; Felice M., 2010, AD HOC NETW, V1, P; Guo WJ, 2014, APPL MECH MATER, V678, P487, DOI 10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.678.48; Huang SZ, 2013, APPL MECH MATER, V321-324, P762, DOI 10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.321-324.76; Jain S., 2014, INT J COMPUTER APPL, V94, P1; Kaelbling LP, 1996, J ARTIF INTELL RES, V4, P237, DOI 10.1613/jair.30; Lara-Cueva RA, 2017, IEEE SENS J, V17, P1493, DOI 10.1109/JSEN.2016.264621; Le TTT, 2016, ADV SCI TECHNOLOGY L, V142, P2; Liu ZH, 2006, IEEE INT C NETW SENS, P76; McCullock John, Q LEARNING TUTORIA; Misra S, 2011, J NETW COMPUT APPL, V34, P1530, DOI 10.1016/j.jnca.2010.07.00; Morrison J, 2006, SCANDALOUS FICTIONS, P; Mustapha I, 2015, SENSORS-BASEL, V15, P19783, DOI 10.3390/s15081978; Patel AB, 2015, INT RES J ENG TECHNO, V2, P12; Pearce DAJ, 2016, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V53, P114, DOI 10.1177/002072091561114; PSIM, MATLA; Renold AP, 2017, WIRELESS PERS COMMUN, V96, P5061, DOI 10.1007/s11277-016-3729-; Schurgers C, 2001, 2001 MILCOM, VOLS 1 AND 2, PROCEEDINGS, P357, DOI 10.1109/MILCOM.2001.98581; Shah Kunal, 2007, IEEE Internatonal Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems, 2007.

The analysis is carried out in two bachelor engineering degree programs offered in the School of Telecommunication Engineering, at the Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena, Spain: Telecommunication Systems Engineering and Telematics Engineering. Data from seven consecutive academic years have been used to compute three indicators regarding the same cohort of students: exam attendance rate, success rate, and performance rate. The results show that, in general, women obtain better academic performance rates than men in the first two academic courses while, from the third course on, there seems to be a trend toward uniformity in the academic results between female and male students. Furthermore, women generally present lower attrition rates than men, especially in the first year, and better graduation rates. Such facts could be explained by the higher motivation of female students when enrolling engineering programs-due to the adverse stereotyped context that they have to overcome-which lead to higher retention rates throughout the academic years as compared to their male counterparts.","[Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Ignacio] Univ Alicante, Dept Humanidades Contemporineas, Alicante, Spain; [Rodriguez, Jose-Victor; Bueno-Delgado, Maria-Victoria] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Tecnol Informat & Comunicac, Cartagena, Spain; [Elizondo-Moreno, Aranzazu] Freelance, Murcia, Spain","Rodriguez-Rodriguez, I (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Carretera San Vicente del Raspeig S-N, Alacant 03690, Spain.",ignacio.rodriguez1@um.es,"Rodriguez, Ignacio Rodriguez/AAB-4991-2021","Rodriguez, Ignacio Rodriguez/0000-0002-0118-3406",,,"Beilock SL, 2008, CURR DIR PSYCHOL SCI, V17, P339, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00602.; Bell A.E., 2003, J ENG EDUC, V92, P307, DOI [10.1002/j.2168-9830.2003.tb00774.x, DOI 10.1002/J.2168-9830.2003.TB00774.X; Bell AE, 2002, P AM SOC ENG ED AN; Brainard SG., 1998, J ENG EDUC, V87, P369, DOI [10.1109/FIE.1997.644826, 10.1002/j.2168-9830.1998.tb00367.x, DOI 10.1002/J.2168-9830.1998.TB00367.X; Buse K, 2013, CAREER DEV INT, V18, P139, DOI 10.1108/CDI-11-2012-010; Cech E, 2011, AM SOCIOL REV, V76, P641, DOI 10.1177/000312241142081; Cejka MA, 1999, PERS SOC PSYCHOL B, V25, P413, DOI 10.1177/014616729902500400; Charles M, 2009, AM J SOCIOL, V114, P924, DOI 10.1086/59594; Davies PG, 2002, PERS SOC PSYCHOL B, V28, P1615, DOI 10.1177/01461670223764; De Peslouan G., 1974, QUI SONT FEMMES ING; Dietz E.

A new experimental class for teaching light wave-particle duality concept based on the presented setup is also designed for undergraduates who major in Optics. Based on optical radiation pressure theory, the three-dimensional space trapping, localization, and movement of the particles reveal the particle property of light. Based on the beam interferometry technology, the recording and detection of the dual beam interference signal verify the wave property of light. The presented setup employs fiber optical light path, enabling the setup to be resistant to external interference, easy to assemble and move, and low in cost. The presented experimental practice can give students more opportunities to broaden and deepen their understanding of the taught subject content, while using modern experimental instruments and working on problems. During the class, students can know how to use optical instruments in a proper way, understand light wave-particle duality and related concepts, and increase awareness and curiosity of related cutting-edge scientific research.

A short-term dielectric recovery property of breaking for artificial zero current-limiting vacuum circuit breaker was proposed in this study. The breaker comprises superconducting current limiting module and direct-current zero passage breaking module. Breaking feasibility of the superconducting current-limiting direct-current breaker under different nominal voltage was researched. There is a critical separation in the breaking process of direct current under the test condition. Faster breaking speed and shorter arc time were selected in the scope of separation so as to improve the recovery strength of intrinsic dielectric for electrode gap after current zero passage. Lower inverse current zero passage frequency was selected under the same separation and the same arc time so as to improve the recovery strength of intrinsic dielectric after current zero passage.","[Chao, Zhang] Naval Univ Engn, Coll Elect Engn, Wuhan 430033, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Chao, Zhang; Hua, Lin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Elect & Elect Engn, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China","Chao, Z (corresponding author), Naval Univ Engn, Coll Elect Engn, Wuhan 430033, Hubei, Peoples R China.",chaochaozz2@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [51307179],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51307179).","Abdulhay E, 2018, J AMBIENT INTELL HU; Ashokkumar P, 2018, COMPUT ELECTR ENG, V68, P526, DOI 10.1016/j.compeleceng.2018.05.00; CHENG LC, 1989, ELECTRICAL CONTACTS - 1989, P257, DOI 10.1109/HOLM.1989.7794; Cheng XA, 2010, INT SYM DISCH ELECTR, P44; Cheng Xian, 2012, High Voltage Engineering, V38, P1529, DOI 10.3969/j.issn.1003-6520.2012.06.03; Cheng Xian, 2012, Electric Power Automation Equipment, V32, P6; Elhoseny M, 2018, IEEE ACCESS, V6, P20596, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2018.281761; Enas A, 2018, J MED SYS; Jiang Zhuangxian, 2012, Proceedings of the CSEE, V32, P15; Liao MF, 2010, INT SYM DISCH ELECTR, P22; Liu C, 2018, CLUSTER COMPU; Meng G, 2018, CLUSTER COMPU; Moein S-M, 2018, CLUSTER COMPU; Mohammed MA., 2018, J SUPERCOMPU; Narayanan T, 2014, THESI; Shu Shengwen, 2013, Electric Power Automation Equipment, V33, P81, DOI 10.3969/j.issn.1006-6047.2013.11.01; Tamaki S, 2014, INT SYM DISCH ELECTR, P33, DOI 10.1109/DEIV.2014.696161; Tharwat A, 2018, CLUSTER COMPU; Todorovic R, 2015, 2015 IEEE PULSED POWER CONFERENCE (PPC; Wei J, 2018, FUTURE GEN COMPUT S; Xian C, 2012, PULS POW C, P29; [徐国顺 Xu Guoshun], 2013, [电工技术学报, Transactions of China Electrotechnical Society], V28, P17",22,0,0,1,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Among different architecture, the Z-source riven bias inverter controls the parameter on the AC and DC sections. The steady state quantity and the time-varying parameter are regulated by controlling the intonation index. The modulation indexes are framed by digital to look at its supervision theme in grid coupled structure that has certainly not been studied so far. Hence, in this paper, the Z-source riven bias electrical converter modeling has been studied in conjunction with the decoupled space vector modulation as a control technique. The deliberate theme is studied and simulated by using a MATLAB/Simulink model to approve the analysis and simulations.","[Ramya, K.; Kumar, K. A.

Atmosphere plasma spraying method was used for preparing aluminum/titanium oxide ceramic coating with nano structure, and fixing spraying current, spraying distance and powder feeder rotation speed. Four groups of hot spraying specimens with different processes were prepared by adjusting the main air pressure and spraying voltage, which optimized the preparation process. The bonding strength, microstructure, hardness, fracture toughness, cupping property and thermal shock resistance after optimization were represented, and the friction and wear performances of nano ceramic coating in the ball disc mode were also represented. The optimal nano ceramic coating was AT13, which was determined by the microstructure hardness, crack resistance and fracture toughness data of coating. Nano ceramic coating had higher bonding strength and hardness, and nano tissue of original powder inherited excellent cupping resistance of nano coating, so the toughness is obviously better than that of traditional micron coating. After water quenching cycle test at 400 degrees C for 50 times, the coating did not lose efficacy at all. In the ball disc friction wear under high load, the wear extent of nano ceramic coating is low, and the friction coefficient is stable, which shows good wear resistance. Nano aluminum oxide ceramic coating has high bonding strength, excellent cupping performance, wear resistance, good comprehensive mechanical properties, so it could be used for rigid working environment.","[Xie Mingda] Air Force Engn Univ, Grad Coll, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Tian Xiaoxia; Qu Shaobo] Air Force Engn Univ, Dept Fdn, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Xie, MD (corresponding author), Air Force Engn Univ, Grad Coll, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",xiemingd62@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [21471159],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 21471159).","Ayadi AME, 2015, EXP REV OBSTET GYNEC, V8, P52; Dvornikov M, 2014, J COSMOL ASTROPART P, V2014, P62; Haoula Z, 2015, METABOLOMICS, V11, P657, DOI 10.1007/s11306-014-0726-; Kanazawa I, 2014, MED SCI MONITOR, V20, P1662, DOI 10.12659/MSM.89098; Kaur H, 2012, RADIOGRAPHICS, V32, P389, DOI 10.1148/rg.32211512; Khera AV, 2016, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V67, P2578, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2016.03.52; Levy RH, 2015, AIAA J, V2, P150; Leyva-Gomez G, 2015, DRUG DISCOV TODAY, V20, P824, DOI 10.1016/j.drudis.2015.02.00; Lualdi M, 2014, GEOPHYS J INT, V196, P818, DOI 10.1093/gji/ggt42; Miao H, 2015, CHEM-BIOL INTERACT, V228, P79, DOI 10.1016/j.cbi.2015.01.02; Millon A, 2014, VASCULAR, V22, P221, DOI 10.1177/170853811347875; Mohammed MA, 2018, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V89, P539, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.07.02; Mutlag AA, 2019, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V90, P62, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.07.04; Sohal SS, 2014, INT J CHRONIC OBSTR, V9, P533, DOI 10.2147/COPD.S6391",14,5,5,1,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The protection system designed in AC system faces many difficulties like frequency matching, reactive power violation, and instability. The main objective of the proposed system is to eliminate the faulty segment promptly while keeping the healthy segments functioning unaltered. In the proposed method, a unitwise controller is designed and is connected in feedback so as to maintain stability under all conditions. The unitwise controller comprises primary and secondary controllers which continually monitor all the units of DC grid comprising semiconductor bidirectional switches and snubber circuits. A primary controller is used for monitoring the complete variation in the parameters in all the units. If the observed parameter value is greater than the acceptable range, the secondary controllers receive the command so as to take the required action to eliminate the faulty segment. Both lines and ground faults are tested on all the sections separately and also simultaneously. The tested results are analyzed in all aspects and the results of the states that the designed protection scheme competent in isolating the defective segment within a short period of time. Once the defective segment is isolated, the other segments retain the stabilized voltage and current limits.

Study of recommendation systems to facilitate students' education in their relevant services is being carried out in different perspective. Hence, the objective of this work is to apply existing knowledge for decision making to recommend students during their course registration process in an institution. The situation where more number of experts involves in decision making was influenced by Fuzzy Soft Expert Set (FSES). This work emphasizes the application of FSES for facilitating students' course registration process assuming that the same course is offered by more number of faculty members during a semester. As more number of experts involved in this process and the uncertainty of the available data, using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) along with FSES was considered. A new methodology FSES-TOPSIS was also applied in this work. The proposed method was accurate enough to enable students to rank the faculty members based on their previous performance and to enroll themselves with the faculty members of their interest. The method proposed here can be extended for various problems of similar nature.","[Rani, B. Selva] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Informat Technol & Engn, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Kumar, S.

The analysis was carried out on two bachelor engineering degree programs offered at the School of Telecommunication Engineering at the Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena, Spain: Telecommunication Systems Engineering and Telematics Engineering. Data from seven consecutive academic years were used to compute three indicators regarding the same cohort of students: exam attendance rate, success rate, and performance rate. The results show that although there exists a significant correlation between AGPA and student performance, it is truly relevant only in the first two academic courses (in this work, a course is assumed to be the compilation of all subjects in a year). In view of the results, a set of guidelines is proposed in order to soften the impact of AGPA on the progress of university students.","[Rodriguez, Jose-Victor; Bueno-Delgado, Maria-Victoria; Sanchez-Aarnoutse, Juan-Carlos; Pastor-Franco, Juan-Angel; Juan-Llacer, Leandro] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Tecnol Informac & Comunicac, Plaza Hosp 1, Murcia, Spain","Rodriguez, JV (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Tecnol Informac & Comunicac, Plaza Hosp 1, Cartagena 30202, Spain.",jvictor.rodriguez@upct.es,"Juan-Llácer, Leandro/AAL-6352-2020; Sanchez-Aarnoutse, Juan Carlos/ABG-2392-2020","Juan-Llácer, Leandro/0000-0003-1046-3466; Sanchez-Aarnoutse, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-5330-1160",,,"Adebanjo A.T., 2008, PAC J SCI TECHNOL, V9, P7; Afzal H., 2010, INT J BUSINESS MANAG, V5, P80, DOI [DOI 10.5539/IJBM.V5N4P80, https://doi.org/10.5539/ijbm.v5n4p80; Ali S., 2013, AM J ED RES, V1, P283, DOI DOI 10.12691/EDUCATI0N-1-8-; Byrne M., 2008, J ACCOUNTING ED, V26, P20; Chamorro-Premuzic T, 2003, J RES PERS, V37, P319, DOI 10.1016/S0092-6566(02)00578-; Chamorro-Premuzic T, 2008, PERS INDIV DIFFER, V44, P1596, DOI 10.1016/j.paid.2008.01.00; CHEN CS, 1995, CHILD DEV, V66, P1215, DOI 10.2307/113180; Cokley K., 2000, J BLACK PSYCHOL, V26, P148, DOI [10.1177/0095798400026002002, DOI 10.1177/0095798400026002002; Fenollar P, 2007, BRIT J EDUC PSYCHOL, V77, P873, DOI 10.1348/000709907X18911; Froiland JM, 2016, PSYCHOL SCHOOLS, V53, P321, DOI 10.1002/pits.2190; Gifford D.D., 2006, J COLL ADMISSION, V191, P1; Hoffman JL, 2005, REV HIGH EDUC, V28, P455, DOI 10.1353/rhe.2005.004; Killen R., 1994, HIGHER ED RES DEV, V13, P199, DOI [https://doi.org/10.1080/0729436940130210, DOI 10.1080/0729436940130210; Kuncel NR, 2007, ACAD MANAG LEARN EDU, V6, P51, DOI 10.5465/AMLE.2007.2440170; Mills C, 2009, ADV HEALTH SCI EDUC, V14, P205, DOI 10.1007/s10459-008-9103-; Parker JDA, 2004, PERS INDIV DIFFER, V36, P163, DOI 10.1016/S0191-8869(03)00076-; PETERSON C, 1987, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V53, P603, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.53.3.60; Reyes MR, 2012, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V104, P700, DOI 10.1037/a002726; REYNOLDS WM, 1988, J PERS ASSESS, V52, P223, DOI 10.1207/s15327752jpa5202_; Richardson M, 2012, PSYCHOL BULL, V138, P353, DOI 10.1037/a002683; SCHIEFELE U, 1991, EDUC PSYCHOL, V26, P29; Schweitzer, 2001, HIGHER ED RES DEV, V20, P21, DOI [10.1080/07924360120043621, DOI 10.1080/07924360120043621, https://doi.org/10.1080/07924360120043621; Springer L, 1999, REV EDUC RES, V69, P21, DOI 10.3102/0034654306900102; Tavani C.

There are numerous reasons for this difficulty encountered by the students. First off, humans are not innately good at probabilistic intuition. Traditionally, this subject has been introduced in a very abstract manner without emphasis on real-world applications from electrical and computer engineering discipline. In addition, extensive use of interactive simulation and visualization tools, offering an alternative way of developing probabilistic intuition, is usually missing from traditional course offerings. This paper presents a unique pedagogical approach to teaching an introductory probability course offered to electrical and computer engineering juniors. The salient features of the proposed pedagogical approach include more emphasis on real-world electrical and computer engineering problems that show the applications of abstract probabilistic concepts; extensive hands-on and interactive MATLAB (R) simulations of real-world electrical and computer engineering problems that are tightly integrated into the curriculum; highlighting the frequentist approach to build probabilistic intuition using simulations; concrete examples showing how naive probabilistic intuition can be erroneous and how to develop correct probabilistic intuition based on systematically modeling, simulating, and analyzing a problem; and application-based simulations driving the abstract theory rather than the other way around. This pedagogical approach was implemented in a course offered to electrical and computer engineering undergraduates at Purdue University Northwest. The paper presents a concrete example illustrating how the salient features of the proposed pedagogical approach were implemented as part of this course and student data from the courses to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.","[Sheikh, Waseem] Purdue Univ Northwest, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1401 US-421, Westville, IN 46391 USA","Sheikh, W (corresponding author), Purdue Univ Northwest, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1401 US-421, Westville, IN 46391 USA.",waseem@pnw.edu,,,,,"ANDERSON TW, 1954, J AM STAT ASSOC, V49, P765, DOI 10.2307/228153; Batanero C, 2016, ICME-13 TOPICAL SURV, P1, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-31625-3_; Ben-Zvi D, 2015, TEACHING LEARNING S; Bertsekas D.

These are subjects that require a deep mathematical and theoretical basis, but the practical goal is not often emphasized, which drives students to lose interest in the subject. Thus, a software-defined radio environment is proposed to provide a more practical view of the subject. This solution consists of an open hardware-software platform able to capture and process a wide range of frequencies. HackRF is the hardware component, while GNU Radio will provide the graphical support to this device. The tests performed with a set of 36 students have revealed that they are more satisfied with this framework than just employing a traditional equation-based environment as Matlab. Furthermore, their scores in the exams also support the suitability of the proposed platform.","[Del Barrio, Alberto A.; Ayala, Jose; Hermida, Roman] UCM, Dept Comp Architecture & Automat, Madrid, Spain; [Manzano, Jose P.; Maroto, Victor M.; Villarin, Alvaro] UCM, Phys Fac, Plaza Ciencias 1, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Pagan, Josue] UPM, Dept Elect Engn, Madrid, Spain; [Zapater, Marina] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland","Del Barrio, AA (corresponding author), UCM, Phys Fac, Plaza Ciencias 1, Madrid 28040, Spain.",abarriog@ucm.es,"Zapater, Marina/T-9668-2018; del Barrio, Alberto/G-9962-2015; Pagan, Josue/N-3378-2019","Zapater, Marina/0000-0002-6971-1965; del Barrio, Alberto/0000-0002-6769-1200; Pagan, Josue/0000-0002-8357-7950","EU (FEDER); Spanish MINECO [TIN 2015-65277-R, TEC 2012-33892]; UCM Teaching Innovation Project [PIMCD-2015-18]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work has been supported by the EU (FEDER) and the Spanish MINECO, under grants TIN 2015-65277-R and TEC 2012-33892, and the UCM Teaching Innovation Project PIMCD-2015-18, whose results are accessible at Barrio et al.<SUP>26</SUP>","Ackovska N, 2014, IEEE T EDUC, V57, P242, DOI 10.1109/TE.2014.232700; Atkinson S, 2006, INT J TECHNOL DES ED, V16, P193, DOI 10.1007/s10798-004-8320-; Bagheri R, 2006, IEEE COMMUN MAG, V44, P111, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2006.167811; Barrio AAD, 2015, TECHNICAL REPOR; Bentounsi A, 2011, IEEE T EDUC, V54, P479, DOI 10.1109/TE.2010.208504; Dawy Z, 2010, IEEE T EDUC, V53, P653, DOI 10.1109/TE.2009.203993; Hamilton C., 2015, BEAGLEBONE BLACK CO; Herger, 2016, TECHNICAL REPOR; Linn Y, 2012, IEEE T EDUC, V55, P169, DOI 10.1109/TE.2011.215831; Llamas-Nistal M, 2014, IEEE T EDUC, V57, P220, DOI 10.1109/TE.2014.233663; Magdalena R, 2008, IEEE T EDUC, V51, P456, DOI 10.1109/TE.2007.91255; Meyer-Base U, 2010, IEEE T EDUC, V53, P638, DOI 10.1109/TE.2009.203921; Mishra AK., 2015, WHITE SPACE COMMUNIC, DOI [10.1007/978-3-319-08747-4, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-08747-4; Proakis J.

Engineering students of several knowledge areas may benefit with the introduction of internet of things concepts in the undergraduate courses, since there is an increasingly need of professionals to work in multidisciplinary teams. This paper proposes an undergraduate course to teach internet of things concepts for engineering students using cooperative problem-based learning (CPBL). The students have to develop a project using different internet of things technologies: sensing and actuation, embedded computing, communication and networking, cloud computing, and data analytics. The proposed course may help students to improve not only their technical skills but also soft skills, such as teamwork, communication and creativity. The developed projects achieved good results, and positive feedback was received from the students.

In this study, an explicit type pulse trigger flip-flop is implemented using the CMOS 90 nm technology. For low-power dissipation, 1 V supply will optimize the size of gate terminal. This explicit type flip-flop uses an explicit source for pulse generation, that is, the double edge-triggered pulse generator, which requires half of clock frequency compared to the single edge-triggered pulse generator. The proposed new double edge-triggered pulse generator uses the pulse generation logic, which is used to share many numbers of flip-flop results at low power.

IoT can offer solutions for many problems. However, it requires many skills from different disciplines that current electrical and computer engineers lack. In order to encourage the seamless internalization of the IoT and the technologies it supports, a new method should be considered in training electrical and computer engineers. The new methods should focus on applications and projects that involve the use of components such as hardware, software, and cloud platforms that are available in the market rather than class oriented theories. In this study, we introduce a methodology for teaching an IoT systems course that will encourage students to study how to develop and accomplish IoT applications in real time, at a reasonable cost, and for general use rather than meeting the detailed needs of one merchant. We exploit universally available open source software and cloud platforms to enhance teaching IoT course. The proposed course is taught at the undergraduate level in the computer engineering departments of Kocaeli and Sakarya Universities in Turkey. The results show that the designed method can have a constructive influence on the progress of computer engineering education by timely and positive assistance in educating the new IoT engineers.","[Kucuk, Kerem; Msongaleli, Dawson Ladislaus] Kocaeli Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Umuttepe Campus, TR-41380 Kocaeli, Turkey; [Bayilmis, Cuneyt] Sakarya Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Sakarya, Turkey","Kucuk, K (corresponding author), Kocaeli Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Umuttepe Campus, TR-41380 Kocaeli, Turkey.",kkucuk@kocaeli.edu.tr,"Bayilmis, Cuneyt/ABI-4012-2020; Kucuk, Kerem/V-6486-2017","Bayilmis, Cuneyt/0000-0003-1058-7100; Kucuk, Kerem/0000-0002-2621-634X",,,"[Anonymous], MIT APP INV LIB DO; Atzori L, 2010, COMPUT NETW, V54, P2787, DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2010.05.01; Byrne JR, 2017, IEEE T EDUC, V60, P50, DOI 10.1109/TE.2016.262625; Chtourou S, 2018, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V55, P62, DOI 10.1177/002072091775095; Corno F, 2017, IEEE T EDUC, V60, P40, DOI 10.1109/TE.2016.260878; Corno F, 2016, IT PROF, V18, P50, DOI 10.1109/MITP.2016.10; Feki MA, 2013, COMPUTER, V46, P24, DOI 10.1109/MC.2013.6; Guzelgoz S, 2010, IEEE T EDUC, V53, P532, DOI 10.1109/TE.2009.203216; Gupta A, 2015, 2015 THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON IMAGE INFORMATION PROCESSING (ICIIP), P285, DOI 10.1109/ICIIP.2015.741478; Hwang YM, 2017, EDUC MEDIA INT, V54, P83, DOI 10.1080/09523987.2017.136283; Jan C.

The complementary strategy incorporates activities usually not taught which are delivered via web-classroom to develop and reinforce the abilities needed to face the industry once they are graduated. A project-based learning strategy is used to reinforce the teaching on sizing, planning, modeling, installations with international standards, the start-up of a photovoltaic system with a monitoring system. Students carry out a financial investment analysis rarely taught, such as the calculation of the payback period, the internal rate of return and the net present value are made to ensure the project viability. Planning-dimensioning usually is taught analyzing the electrical bill to determine the required sizing capacity without considering the building installed capacity. A three-dimensional dimensioning using the geographic location of a possible installation is proposed to provide better information in terms of losses due to shading or obstacles that may affect an installation. Furthermore, it is proposed to perform an analysis of mechanical stresses on the mounting rail system under natural phenomena such as hurricanes. This type of analysis is not usually taught in classes and it is important since an investment can be lost due to natural phenomena as has already occurred in some solar plants. The proposed activities are aimed to develop self-directed learning skills motivating to do research leading to problem-solving and meaningful activities to work autonomously in a natural and real-life situation. This approach allows the teacher and students to ponder deeply about worthy subjects and issues. Five questions were formulated to verify student satisfaction; the 30 surveyed students have a very positive view of this complementary utilized strategy.","[Gonzalez, J.

The team-based learning methodology, which uses the flipped classroom concept, is actively centred on the student. The students study a conceptual material independently before it is covered in the classroom. After that, they spend a considerable amount of time working in groups in the classroom solving problems with conceptual application of the material studied. The last stage of team-based learning is the application of course concepts. However, in the telecommunications field, the high cost of equipment for practical development in educational institutions is a big barrier. Moreover, the equipment used is traditionally dedicated to a single activity. In order to solve this problem and apply all the team-based learning stages in telecommunications engineering teaching, this paper presents a proposal of an adaptation of this methodology using a software-defined radio set using the universal software radio peripheral hardware and the GNU Radio software. This set offers flexible functionalities and low cost. Finally, we show the proposal for each team-based learning stage in the learning process of the amplitude modulator and demodulator - double sideband suppressed carrier relating concepts to practical applications.","[Diniz, P.

While these development platforms solve many low-level challenges, getting started with embedded system prototyping may seem overwhelming for novices. Choosing novice friendly sensors can make a substantial difference. In this paper, a framework for selecting sensors for novice use is presented and accessibility obstacles are defined. Six learning barriers in end-user programming are adopted for evaluating obstacles effecting on novice usability. Four properties for evaluating sensors and to overcome the barriers are presented: protocol complexity, connection type and component size, understandable real-life phenomena measured and documentation. Sensor protocol complexity and documentation are identified as key factors affecting implementation challenges.","[Karvinen, Kimmo] Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Automat & Syst Technol, Maarintie 8, Espoo, Finland","Karvinen, K (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Automat & Syst Technol, Maarintie 8, Espoo, Finland.",kimmo.karvinen@iki.fi,,"Karvinen, Kimmo/0000-0003-3946-4163",,,"Ahmadzadeh M., 2005, SIGCSE Bulletin, V37, P8; Alqadi BS, 2017, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 ACM SIGCSE TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION (SIGCSE'17), P15, DOI 10.1145/3017680.301776; Blikstein P., 2013, P 12 INT C INT DES C, P17; Bonarini A, 2014, ROBOT AUTON SYST, V62, P1073, DOI 10.1016/j.robot.2013.08.00; Booth T, 2015, PROCEEDINGS 2015 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON VISUAL LANGUAGES AND HUMAN-CENTRIC COMPUTING (VL/HCC), P299, DOI 10.1109/VLHCC.2015.735723; Cuellar MP, 2014, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC, V22, P153, DOI 10.1002/cae.2054; Eichbaum QG, 2013, DIAGN STAND CARE, P2; Jamieson P., 2010, P FECS, P28; Jamieson P., 2015, 2015 IEEE FRONT ED C, P; Karvinen K, 2014, MAKE SENSORS HANDS ; Karvinen K, 2015, J SMALL SATELL JOSS, V4, P; Karvinen K, 2018, INT J ENG EDUC, V34, P26; Karvinen Kimmo, 2016, WORLD T ENG TECHNOL, V14, P34; Kelleher C, 2005, ACM COMPUT SURV, V37, P83, DOI 10.1145/1089733.108973; Kim SH, 2009, IEEE T EDUC, V52, P99, DOI 10.1109/TE.2008.91980; Ko AJ, 2004, 2004 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON VISUAL LANGUAGES AND HUMAN CENTRIC COMPUTING: PROCEEDINGS, P19; Lahtinen E., 2005, ACM SIGCSE B, V37, P14, DOI [10.1145/1151954.1067453, DOI 10.1145/1151954.1067453; Pane JF, 2001, INT J HUM-COMPUT ST, V54, P237, DOI 10.1006/ijhc.2000.041; Parisi C., 2014, P WORKSH NAN AGR SEC, DOI [10.2791/80497, DOI 10.2791/80497; Pearce JM, 2012, SCIENCE, V337, P1303, DOI 10.1126/science.122818; Robins A., 2003, COMPUTER SCI ED, V13, P137, DOI [DOI 10.1076/CSED.13.2.137.14200, 10.1076/csed.13.2.137.14200; Sadler J., 2015, P 9 INT C TANG EMB E, P347, DOI [10.1145/2677199.2680581, DOI 10.1145/2677199.2680581; Sadler JA., 2016, THESI; Severance C, 2014, COMPUTER, V47, P11, DOI 10.1109/MC.2014.1; Soriano A., 2014, PROC 19THWORLD C INT, P904; Sykes A, 2011, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON E-LEARNING, VOLS 1 AND 2, P82; Winslow L.

The lectures are given out-of-class with electronic resources and in-class time is reserved for group activities and discussion with the instructor. In this study, we present our implementation of a flipped classroom in a senior level undergraduate engineering course. An extensive perception analysis was carried out with anonymous surveys and face-to-face interviews with students. Performance analysis of the flipped class was carried out by comparing the achievement level in the course learning outcomes of previous years' traditional classes and recent year's flipped class. The out-of-class lectures were implemented as machine-voice-narrated presentations. The effect of machine voice on the flipped classroom is also examined. Students' perception and reaction to various aspects of the flipped class are documented. Performance analysis showed a significant improvement in one category of course learning outcomes. Student perception was positive overall.","[Oncel, Alcsay Fatih] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Ankara, Turkey; [Kara, Ali] Atilim Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, TR-06836 Ankara, Turkey","Kara, A (corresponding author), Atilim Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, TR-06836 Ankara, Turkey.",ali.kara@atilim.edu.tr,"Kara, Ali/S-8257-2019; Kara, Ali/R-8038-2019","Kara, Ali/0000-0002-9739-7619",ATILIM University under the BAP grant [ATU-BAP-A-1213-08],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by ATILIM University under the BAP grant (ATU-BAP-A-1213-08).","[Anonymous], 2018, CRIT ACCR ENG PROG; Bates S., 2012, P HEA STEM LEARN TE; BISHOP JL, 2013, PROC FRONT EDUC CON; Bland L., 2006, P ASEE ANN C EXP CH; Cigdemoglu C, 2014, CROAT J EDUC, V16, P99; Frederickson N, 2005, HIGH EDUC, V50, P645, DOI 10.1007/s10734-004-6370-; Haykin S.S., 2010, COMMUNICATION SYSTEM, V5t; Kara A, 2014, INT J ENG EDUC, V30, P104; Kim GJ, 2014, IEEE T EDUC, V57, P188, DOI 10.1109/TE.2014.229821; Kim MK, 2014, INTERNET HIGH EDUC, V22, P37, DOI 10.1016/j.iheduc.2014.04.00; Mason GS, 2013, IEEE T EDUC, V56, P430, DOI 10.1109/TE.2013.224906; O'Flaherty J, 2015, INTERNET HIGH EDUC, V25, P85, DOI 10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.02.00; Oncel AF., 2016, INT J ENG TECHNOL, V13, P; Strayer J., 2007, THESIS U COLUMBU",14,22,22,1,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The effect is that students are drawn away from related research areas. Some approaches were developed to enhance the motivation and physical insight of the concepts seen in class. Electromagnetic compatibility is used as a source of real world examples where students see that applied electromagnetics is not a field unrelated with their experiences. In addition to that, final projects with handmade antennas help guide students through a complete design cycle, from analytical formulation to the actual measurement, so that the connections concerning the theory, simulation, prototyping, and measurements are closed. These techniques were applied and provided good results, increasing the understanding and motivation among students toward radio-frequency and antenna-related areas.","[Perotoni, Marcelo Bender] Univ Fed Abc, Santo Andre, Brazil; [Vieira, Marcos Stefanelli] Mackenzie Presbiterian Univ, Sao Paulo, Brazil","Perotoni, MB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Abc, Santo Andre, Brazil.",marcelo.perotoni@ufabc.edu.br,"perotoni, marcelo/AAT-7421-2021","perotoni, marcelo/0000-0002-7398-5766; Stefanelli Vieira, Marcos/0000-0002-7358-5447",,,"ANDERSON JR, 1984, QST, V68, P4; Balanis C.A., 2008, MODERN ANTENNA HD; Bunting CF, 2009, IEEE T EDUC, V52, P350, DOI 10.1109/TE.2008.92891; Chen L.F., 2004, MICROWAVE ELECT MEA; Feynman, 1985, SURELY YOURE JOKIN; Halliday F, 2001, TLS-TIMES LIT SUPPL, P; Han B., 2011, INT S IT MED ED ITM; HOBURG JF, 1993, IEEE T EDUC, V36, P119, DOI 10.1109/13.20482; John L., 2007, ANTENNA ENG HDB, P; Keller SD, 2009, P 2009 3 EUR C ANT ; Lo Y.

However, in the usual teaching process, teachers often teach this knowledge using some simple examples of analysis and calculation but without deep discussions. As a result, students could not have a deep understanding about these concepts or not apply the concepts on actual problems flexibly. Therefore, passive learning habits are formed. The lack of self-exploration awareness and comprehensive ability would result in a poor learning effect. This paper designs a specific application scene of Kirchhoff's circuit laws using a multi-channel resistor network. With this application, students can construct the knowledge system autonomously, find the problems proactively, solve the problems timely, and combine the research-based autonomous learning with extracurricular open mutual learning; so, their active learning ability will be promoted to a large extent. Compared with the past teaching methods, this pedagogical case highlights the following advantages of active learning. Firstly, it highlights the process of guiding students to study the object from a small-scale resistor network to a complex and large-scale multi-channel resistor network. Secondly, it embodies the concrete application of calculus knowledge in various basic courses with the help of perfect mathematical deduction. Thirdly, it exercises students' programming ability by using MATLAB to numerically simulate theoretical results. Finally, this case practices students' hands-on experimental ability by constructing real resistor circuits and verifying the theory and simulation results. In addition, we get good feedback from students on the teaching effect through the questionnaire survey.","[Kang, Rui; Lin, Yixuan] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Optoelect Informat, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuexin] Univ Elect Sci & Technol, UoG UESTC Joint Sch, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hao; Wu, Minghe; Teng, Baohua] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Phys Elect, Chengdu 610054, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Teng, BH (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Phys Elect, Chengdu 610054, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",phytbh@163.com,"Kang, Rui/AAF-5175-2021","Kang, Rui/0000-0002-1564-8753; Teng, Baohua/0000-0003-0731-9316",,,"Alexander C.

It is a challenge for robotics course professors to get students to clearly understand the basic theoretical concepts for its correct application to solve problems, and to motivate them to achieve the best performance. Previous works proposed the use of 3D models to perform the simulation of industrial robots in class and consequently to reinforce the students' theoretical and practical concepts. However, it has not yet been clearly demonstrated how the use of robots and simulations helps improve students' academic performance. In this paper, the main contribution consists of a formal evaluation in which the comparison between the use of two teaching methods was carried out. In the first teaching method (traditional method), the professor used PowerPoint presentations and oral explanations to teach theoretical concepts and solve exercises (Group A). In the second teaching method, the professor added the use of 3D simulations together with the traditional method to teach theoretical concepts and solve exercises (Group B). Students of both groups performed the same written exam about forward kinematics in order to study and analyse the differences between the methodology used with Group A and the methodology used with Group B. This exam consisted of solving three exercises with different robot complexity levels. The results demonstrate that the performance of the students in group B is significantly better than that of the students in group A. In other words, the use of 3D simulations improves student's academic performance, and provides a teaching tool to enhance the way the professors teach.","[Loreto-Gomez, Gerardo] Inst Tecnol Super Uruapan, Dept Ingn Mecatron, Uruapan, Mexico; [Rodriguez-Arce, Jorge; Montano-Serrano, Victor M.] Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Fac Ingn, Ciudad Univ Cerro de Coatepec S-N, Toluca 50110, Mexico; [Gonzalez-Garcia, Salvador] Tecnol Monterrey, Dept Reg Comp & Mecatron, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias Reg Ctr, Campus Morelia, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico","Rodriguez-Arce, J (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Fac Ingn, Ciudad Univ Cerro de Coatepec S-N, Toluca 50110, Mexico.",jrodrigueza@uaemex.mx,"RODRIGUEZ-ARCE, JORGE/AAH-2945-2020","RODRIGUEZ-ARCE, JORGE/0000-0003-0289-7061; Montano-Serrano, Victor Manuel/0000-0002-3228-2773; Loreto, Gerardo/0000-0002-3960-8801",,,"Antonelli G, 2009, MATHMOD 0; Braunl T, 2007, AM ASS ART INT FAL; Cao Y, 2011, ASEE ANNU CONF EXP; Carpin S, 2007, IEEE INT C ROB AUT, DOI [10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363180, DOI 10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363180; Craig J., 2009, INTRO ROBOTICS MEC; Dale E., 1946, AUDIO VISUAL METHODS, P3; Denavit J., 1955, J APPL MECH, V22, P21; Dunn T.

This important topic is taught in advanced courses of operation and control of power systems, for graduate and undergraduate power engineering students. However, the most used software packages for simulation and analysis of power systems by researchers, students, and educators have put little attention on the state estimation module. Due to this fact, this paper proposes an approach to develop the computational implementation of a practical educational tool for state estimation of electric power systems using the MATLAB optimization toolbox. In this proposal, the formulation of the state estimation problem consists of developing a general digital code to implement an objective function based on the weighted least squares method. While the lsqnonlin function of the MATLAB optimization toolbox solves the formulated state estimation problem. Simplifying both research and educational processes, this tool helps graduate and undergraduate students to improve learning, understanding, and the times of implementation and development of research in state estimation. Simulations of an equivalent model of the Mexican interconnected power system consisting of 190 buses and 46 machines are used to test and validate the proposal performance.","[Zamora-Cardenas, E.

The study on job satisfaction has greater importance with the passage of time because of its nature and impact on the faculty and society. The researcher administered a standardized questionnaire on 180 individual respondents to collect the data. Respondents filled the items manually with their characteristics: age, gender, qualification, work experience, and their job position to check their level of significance with the job satisfaction. Descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analysis were used for the data analysis. Based on the statistical findings, supervisor support and working conditions have a significant positive relationship with job satisfaction. These findings extend the theoretical understanding of supervisor support and work environment which enhance the faculty job satisfaction. Results also urge colleges and higher educational institutions to understand and to emphasize the importance of the work environment, which has an impact on faculty job satisfaction.","[Kakada, Praveen; Deshpande, Y.

It implies a complex multidisciplinary panorama which includes ongoing subjects for which traditional electrical and computer engineers are not entirely ready. As the implementation of Smart-Grid is imminent, high-skilled professionals are needed to absorb the research, labor, business, logistics, and innovation issues of today and tomorrow. This leads to a transformation of the education role for undergraduate programs which is now, accordingly, urged to build up students' research skills. In this paper, a case study is presented to introduce and asses a new teaching/evaluation methodology intended to build critical thinking, objectivity, and ingenuity among mechanical-electrical undergraduate students during a one-semester course on Smart-Grid. The results show that the proposed technique may improve the aforementioned research skills within the group of students. Overall, the proposed methodology can be used as a protocol to guide new research cases and to frame similar educational proposals.","[Ponce, Pedro; Ibarra, Luis; Mata, Omar; Molina, Arturo] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Engn & Sci, Mexico City 14380, DF, Mexico","Ibarra, L (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Engn & Sci, Mexico City 14380, DF, Mexico.",ibarra.luis@itesm.mx,"Ibarra, Luis/W-9477-2019; Molina, Arturo/AAS-7147-2020","Ibarra, Luis/0000-0002-7290-3001; Molina, Arturo/0000-0001-5461-2879; Ponce, Pedro/0000-0001-7035-5286; Mata, Omar/0000-0002-2432-358X","CONACYT SENER Fund for Energy Sustainability [266632, S0019201401]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is a product of the Project 266632 Laboratorio Binacional para la Gestion Inteligente de la Sustentabilidad Energetica y la Formacion Tecnologica (Bi-National Laboratory on Smart Sustainable Energy Management and Technology Training), funded by the CONACYT SENER Fund for Energy Sustainability (Agreement: S0019201401).","Afdal HW, 2018, TEACH TEACH EDUC, V74, P215, DOI 10.1016/j.tate.2018.05.01; Alayon S, 2013, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC, V21, pE121, DOI 10.1002/cae.2053; [Anonymous], 2009, CASE STUDY RES DESI; Beringer J, 2007, J GEOGR HIGHER EDUC, V31, P445, DOI 10.1080/0309826070151403; Brown H.E., 2010, ELECT J, V23, P64, DOI [10.1016/j.tej.2010.05.005, DOI 10.1016/J.TEJ.2010.05.005; DeLorenzo Group, SMART GRI; Durham MF, 2017, CBE-LIFE SCI EDUC, V1; Fajri P, 2016, IEEE INTEL TRANSP SY, V8, P8, DOI 10.1109/MITS.2015.250573; Ghasem N, 2016, EUR J ENG EDUC, V41, P455, DOI 10.1080/03043797.2015.109515; Heydt G., 2009, P IEEE POW EN SOC GE, P; Hu QR, 2015, IEEE T EDUC, V58, P32, DOI 10.1109/TE.2014.232152; Huet I, 2018, EUR J ENG EDUC, V43, P725, DOI 10.1080/03043797.2017.141529; Ilic M., 2010, POW EN SOC GEN M IEE, P; Kember D, 2000, HIGH EDUC, V40, P69, DOI 10.1023/A:100406850031; Kezunovic M, 2010, IEEE POW ENER SOC G; Lunardi L, 2013, ASEE ANNU CONF EXP; Mathworks, 2016, PHYS SYST SIM SIM; McKenna AF, 2016, EUR J ENG EDUC, V41, P411, DOI 10.1080/03043797.2015.108583; Micari M, 2016, EUR J ENG EDUC, V41, P380, DOI 10.1080/03043797.2015.107981; Momoh J.A., 2012, SMART GRID FUNDAMEN; Monemi SS., 2011, 2011 ASEE ANN C EX; Moslehi K, 2010, IEEE T SMART GRID, V1, P57, DOI 10.1109/TSG.2010.204634; Mwasilu F, 2014, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V34, P501, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2014.03.03; Pons D, 2016, EUR J ENG EDUC, V41, P530, DOI 10.1080/03043797.2015.109516; Srivastava AK, 2017, IEEE T POWER SYST, V32, P2267, DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2016.261158; Srivastava K., 2012, POW EN SOC GEN M IEE, P; Strasser T, 2014, IEEE T POWER SYST, V29, P1989, DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2014.230574; Tlhoaele M, 2016, EUR J ENG EDUC, V41, P263, DOI 10.1080/03043797.2015.105610; Tuballa ML, 2016, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V59, P710, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2016.01.01; TURMEAU WA, 1982, HIGH EDUC, V11, P397, DOI 10.1007/BF0015765; Turner MJ, 2017, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V54, P299, DOI 10.1177/002072091668731",31,10,10,2,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

J,"Averbukh, M1",,,,"Averbukh, M.",,,Improved dimensionless nomograms approach in the electric drives and power electronics courses,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Dimensionless nomogram; power electronics; electrical drives; input-output parameters estimation,,"Parameter estimation of the nonlinear electronic schemes, including inductances, capacitances, resistances, and switches represents a nontrivial problem in the power electronics and electrical drives courses. Difficulties could be observed during solutions of electrical circuits, which describe the behavior of electric motors in drives, and various electronic appliances are being used in power electronics. This situation is a result of complicated analytical approaches aiming to solve nonlinear ordinary differential equations describing the occurring processes. A typical student has a significant problem in attaining the analytical results. Various methods of linearization nonlinear elements permitting to obtain roughly analytical solutions and simplified solution were applied over the past. Nowadays, coarsely obtained results are not acceptable as a rule. As a result, smart simulation based on PSIM, MATLAB Simulink, and WOLFRAM Mathematica giving excellent opportunity for accurate answers are recommended. All software programs represent undoubtedly important and extremely accurate approaches. However, only numerical results are provided and are not capable of solution's generalization. It seems that in the Power Electronics and Electrical Drives courses, a wide submission could obtain methods of numerical nomograms with dimensionless representation of input-output parameters. Dimensionless approach allows significant diminishing of a number of decisive parameters and simplifies calculation, whereas keeping acceptable precision of results, as well as a possibility of outcome's generalization and representation variables trends in a wide range of input parameters. The likely objects of analysis may be, for example, output characteristics of DC motors fed by controllable and uncontrollable n-phase rectifiers, resistive rectifier losses and motor's efficiency, average and root mean square currents or voltages in electronic circuits, total harmonic distortion, and others. Long-time practice of these approaches approved their usefulness, productivity, and helpfulness.","[Averbukh, M.] Ariel Univ, Dept Elect Elect Engn, Ariel, Israel","Averbukh, M (corresponding author), Ariel Univ, Dept Elect Elect Engn, Ariel, Israel.",mosheav@ariel.ac.il,,,,,"Averbukh M, 2016, 2016 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE SCIENCE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING (ICSEE; Emadi A, 2008, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V55, P2237, DOI 10.1109/TIE.2008.92276; Erickson R.

This case study discusses the experience of introducing a nonmajor undergraduate student to electrical engineering through an undergraduate research project at The University of Alabama investigating the electrical properties of bamboo, which required the characterization of a portable moisture meter. These exercises were successful at improving the student's confidence and proficiency with electrical test equipment, highlighting the limitations of test equipment, and applying concepts of resistance to a real-world application that overlaps electrical, chemical, and biological disciplines. While this exercise was a component of an undergraduate research experience, similar exercises could be easily integrated into electrical engineering laboratories for nonelectrical engineering majors to introduce and reinforce concepts from electrical engineering using a multidisciplinary application.","[Freeborn, Todd J.] Univ Alabama, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Damond, Jada] Univ Maryland, Dept Chem Biochem & Environm Engn, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA","Freeborn, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",tjfreeborn1@eng.ua.edu,"Freeborn, Todd J./H-7054-2019","Freeborn, Todd J./0000-0001-9979-7301",National Science Foundation [1559867],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant no. 1559867.

Generally speaking, it involves a number of tedious concepts that have intrinsic physical meaning, which is difficult for students to understand . In this paper, an educational method using diaphragmatic electromyographic (EMGdi) as the de-noising object, which runs on the MATLAB software, has been developed for the convenience of learning and understanding for three-years students in digital signal processing course. This method transforms the analog filter to a digital filter by applying bilinear transformation equations, which allows the students explore the various characteristics of digital filter, such as low pass filter, high pass filter, band pass filter and band stop filter. That means Laplace equation transformed by inductance, capacitance and resistance will be replaced by the z equation, which is used for deriving sequence of difference equations. In the case studies, the clinical EMGdi is used to show the features of the developed method. Furthermore, classroom experience in the Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University has shown that the developed method helps in consolidating a better understanding of signal de-noising processing in digital signal processing course.","[Luo, Guo] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Luo, G (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Nanfang Coll, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",185616509@qq.com,,,,,"ARY JP, 1979, IEEE T BIO-MED ENG, V26, P696, DOI 10.1109/TBME.1979.32646; Chapman R, 2000, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V48, P854, DOI 10.1109/78.82467; Jolley CJ, 2015, EUR RESPIR J, V45, P355, DOI 10.1183/09031936.0006301; Martinez-Torres MR, 2005, IEEE T EDUC, V48, P422, DOI 10.1109/TE.2005.84973; Meyer-Base U, 2010, IEEE T EDUC, V53, P638, DOI 10.1109/TE.2009.203921; Norilo V, 2015, COMPUT MUSIC J, V39, P30, DOI 10.1162/COMJ_a_0033; Shankar PM, 2016, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V53, P291, DOI 10.1177/002072091562247; Wei C, 2007, DIGIT SIGNAL PROCESS, V17, P50, DOI 10.1016/j.dsp.2006.04.00; Yu C, 2002, IEEE T CONSUM ELECTR, V43, P127; Zhuge QF, 2004, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V52, P1090, DOI 10.1109/TSP.2004.82350",10,7,7,6,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

One of the main issues of e-learning, especially in engineering education, is the lack of online educational laboratories. Practical work remains a considerable burden as engineering educational programs focus on handling real equipment. These last are only accessible within a restrictive schedule and might be unaffordable for low budget institutions. The need is clear for interactive platforms that enhance the motivation and controls the regulation of workload for each student. In this paper, an overview about online laboratories is given and a simple approach of remote lab is suggested. The proposal of our research team (Team SEITI) can be used for carrying-out experiments that require neither assembly nor physical changes until the results are obtained unless a technician, that must be present in the laboratory, acts on equipment. The idea is to set up a real-time measurement retrieval laboratory that requires the involvement of a technician to act on instruments and will grant access to a large scale of students.","[Zine, Othmane; Errouha, Mustapha; Zamzoum, Othmane; Derouich, Aziz; Talbi, Abdennebi] Univ Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah, Higher Sch Technol Fez, Lab PE2D, Team SEITI, Fes, Morocco","Zine, O (corresponding author), Univ Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah, Higher Sch Technol Fez, Lab PE2D, Team SEITI, Fes, Morocco.",othmane.zine@usmba.ac.ma,"errouha, mustapha/L-6700-2018","ZINE, Othmane/0000-0002-6429-1666; Derouich, Aziz/0000-0003-4598-5002",,,"Aktan B, 1996, IEEE T EDUC, V39, P320, DOI 10.1109/13.53875; Asumadu JA, 2005, IEEE T INSTRUM MEAS, V54, P38, DOI 10.1109/TIM.2004.83459; Auer ME23.

Two second-year classes in electrical engineering at the University Tahri Mohamed in Bechar, Algeria, were involved in the study. The experiment compared the level to which one class of students mastered goals without the use of information and communication technologies, to the mastery achieved by a second class which participated in a tutorial that has a technological tool built into the project-based approach. The subject of power electronics was chosen for this study because of its different knowledge, which is strongly represented in difficult learning contents for students. A questionnaire about motivation was used to collect data within an experimental research plan. After three months of conducting the study, the results demonstrated that the integration of the tutorial with the project-based approach is likely to increase students' motivation to learn and to master the subject of power electronics.","[Belagra, Mammar; Draoui, Belkacem] Bechar Univ, 110 Cite 160 Logement, Bechar 08000, Algeria","Belagra, M (corresponding author), Bechar Univ, 110 Cite 160 Logement, Bechar 08000, Algeria.",maamar_didact@yahoo.fr,"DRAOUI, Belkacem/AAE-1461-2019","DRAOUI, Belkacem/0000-0001-5490-3991",,,"AMES C, 1992, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V84, P261, DOI 10.1037/0022-0663.84.3.26; Ames C., 1992, STUDENT PERCEPTIONS, P32; Archambault J, 1996, VERS GESTION ED CLA; Arpin L, 2001, APPRENTISSAGE PROJET, P25; Bernet E., 2002, THESI; Bernet E., 2010, THESI; Campos-Delgado DU, 2010, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V47, P430, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.47.4.; Chiang C.

Adequate selection of the method is done by using the tests for checking the given factors to the students' data, which are later used to select the most favorable method for learning a programming language.","[Iskrenovic-Momcilovic, Olivera] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Educ, Sombor, Serbia","Iskrenovic-Momcilovic, O (corresponding author), Univ Novi Sad, Fac Educ, Sombor, Serbia.",oljkaisk@yahoo.com,,"Iskrenovic-Momcilovic, Olivera/0000-0003-0162-4416",,,"Biemans HJA, 1996, INSTR SCI, V24, P157, DOI 10.1007/BF0012048; Bosch N, 2013, P INT C ART INT ED ; Campbell L., 2009, MINDFUL LEARNING 101, P; Charters P, 2014, P 45 ACM TECHN S CO; Combefis Sebastien, 2016, Olympiads in Informatics, V10, P39, DOI 10.15388/ioi.2016.0; Costley KC, 2012, SRATE J, V21, P2; D'Mello S, 2012, LEARN INSTR, V22, P145, DOI 10.1016/j.learninstruc.2011.10.00; DOCHY FJRC, 1995, EUR J PSYCHOL EDUC, V10, P225, DOI 10.1007/BF0317291; Dunlosky J, 2013, PSYCHOL SCI PUBL INT, V14, P4, DOI 10.1177/152910061245326; Farooq M.S., 2011, J QUAL TECHNOL MANAG, V7, P; Febrilia I, 2011, P 3 INT C HUM SOC SC, P; Feldgen M, 2004, 34 ASEE IEEE FRONT ; Graziotin D, 2015, PEERJ COMPUT SCI, DOI 10.7717/peerj-cs.1; Hall N, 2004, BACKGROUND KNOWLEDG; Jenkins T., 2001, SIGCSE Bulletin, V33, P5; Khan IA, 2013, COGN TECHNOL WORK, V13, P24; Kudryashova A., 2015, MEDITERRANEAN J SOCI, DOI [10.5901/mjss.2016.v7n1p460, DOI 10.5901/MJSS.2016.V7N1P460; Lee DMC, AFFECTIVE COMPUTING, P17; Marzano RJ., 2004, BUILDING ACAD BACKG; Mushtaq I., 2012, GLOB J MANAG BUS RES, V12, P1; Pekrun R, 2006, EDUC PSYCHOL REV, V18, P315, DOI 10.1007/s10648-006-9029-; Piaget J., 1968, DEV MEMORY IDENTIT; Pintrich P.R., 1991, MANUAL USE MOTIVATE; Thompson, 1998, MOTIVATING STUDENTS, P1; Wrobel M., 2013, P 6 INT C HUM SYST ; Zainal NFA, 2012, PROCD SOC BEHV, V59, P277, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.09.27",26,7,7,6,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The design was randomized subjects with pretest and posttest control group design. The participants (N=148) were randomized to treatment and control conditions. Repeated measures analysis of variance and univariate analysis of variance were conducted by the researchers to compare changes across the treatment and control group participants. To test for differences in categorical data representing characteristics of the participants, the researchers used Chi-square (chi(2)) statistic. Results show that the experimental group achieved higher achievement scores than the control group for electronic works achievement test at the posttest and follow-up test stages. Furthermore, the study found that there was no significant difference (P>0.05) in the achievement of students in the different ability levels and genders after the treatment. Hence, problem-based learning was advocated for teachers of electronic works in Nigeria.","[Orji, Chibueze Tobias; Ogbuanya, Theresa Chinyere] Univ Nigeria, Fac Vocat & Tech Educ, Dept Ind Tech Educ, Nsukka 410001, Nigeria","Ogbuanya, TC (corresponding author), Univ Nigeria, Fac Vocat & Tech Educ, Dept Ind Tech Educ, Nsukka 410001, Nigeria.",chinyere.ogbuanya@unn.edu.ng,"Orji, Chibueze Tobias/I-4488-2019","Orji, Chibueze Tobias/0000-0002-3457-6206; Ogbuanya, Theresa Chinyere/0000-0002-1656-0147",,,"Adesoji FA., 1995, IFE J CURRICULUM STU, V1, P5; Agbayewa JO., 1996, RES CURRICULUM STUDI, V1, P4; Ahmad A, 2006, P SEM PROBL BAS LEAR, P2; Aina O., 2000, NAT SEM TECHN VOC E; Ajai J.T., 2015, INT J RES ED SCI IJR, V1, P4; Akbarizadeh G., 2015, P 7 C INF KNOWL TECH, P1, DOI DOI 10.1109/IKT.2015.728877; Akbarizadeh G, 2017, NATL ACAD SCI LETT, V40, P117, DOI 10.1007/s40009-016-0513-; Akbarizadeh G, 2014, MALAYS J COMPUT SCI, V27, P21; Akbarizadeh G, 2012, IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE, V50, P4358, DOI 10.1109/TGRS.2012.219478; Akbarizadeh Gholamreza, 2013, J REMOTE SENSING TEC, V1, P44, DOI DOI 10.18005/JRST010200; Akpan AC., 2003, THESI; Akpomi ME, 2009, EUROPEAN J SOCIAL SC, V8, P15; Albanese M.

Traditional undergraduate textbooks and lab exercises rarely highlight the fact that the performance of capacitive proximity sensors can be quite sensitive to ground loading. This paper presents a simple classroom demonstration for exploring this topic in detail. The capacitive proximity sensor for this demonstration is a hand-held LCR meter connected to a homemade capacitor composed of two strips of aluminum foil. Students explore the operation of this sensor for two different system ground configurations. In the first case the LCR meter is battery powered (floating ground referenced) and in the second case the LCR meter is powered by AC mains supply (earth ground referenced). When a student positions their hand near the foil strips, the battery-powered sensor measures an increase in capacitance. Conversely, the AC-mains-powered sensor measures a decrease in capacitance. The instructor guides students to discover for themselves the reason for this seemingly puzzling difference by modeling parasitic capacitance and ground loading using simple circuit models.","[Scher, Aaron D.] Oregon Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn & Renewable Energy, 27500 SW Pkwy Ave, Wilsonville, OR 97070 USA","Scher, AD (corresponding author), Oregon Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn & Renewable Energy, 27500 SW Pkwy Ave, Wilsonville, OR 97070 USA.",aaron.scher@oit.edu,,"Scher, Aaron/0000-0002-5206-9590",,,"Aliau-Bonet C, 2015, J ELECT BIOIMP, V6, P3; Atmel Corporation, QTAN0087 ATM COR; Committee on Earth Gravity from Space, 1997, SATELLITE GRAVITY GE, P1; Davison B, AN1334 MICR TECHN I; DuBroff RE, 2015, EMC EXPT DEMONSTRATI, P1; Harrington RF., 1958, INTRODUCTION ELECTRO, P23; Kawahara Y, 2013, UBICOMP'13: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2013 ACM INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON PERVASIVE AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING, P363, DOI 10.1145/2493432.249348; Keysight Technologies, IMP MEAS HDB GUID M; Liao R, 2016, SNOA952 TEX INST; LiuFeng X, 2016, INT J SIMUL, V1; Quintans C, 2010, 2010 IEEE Education Engineering 2010 - The Future of Global Learning Engineering Education (EDUCON 2010), P445, DOI 10.1109/EDUCON.2010.549254; Schmitt R., 2002, ELECTROMAGNETICS EX; Shorter M., 2014, P 2014 C DES INT SYS, P48",13,8,8,1,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In electric circuits textbooks, the transformation is found by comparing the two networks and making sure that the resistance between each pair of nodes in one network is the same as the resistance between the same pair of nodes in the other network. The two networks are compared as open-circuit networks. This creates confusion among students because usually the network is part of a larger closedcircuit network. In this paper, an alternative method is proposed. The new method starts from one configuration and finds the corresponding equivalent configuration by deriving currents and voltages, as part of a closed circuit. This method can be adopted in circuit analysis courses to help students develop a deeper understanding of this topic.","[Arabasi, Sameer] German Jordanian Univ, Dept Phys, POB 35247, Amman 11180, Jordan","Arabasi, S (corresponding author), German Jordanian Univ, Dept Phys, POB 35247, Amman 11180, Jordan.",sameer.arabasi@gju.edu.jo,,"Arabasi, Sameer/0000-0001-6645-7802",,,"Alexander C.K., 1989, FUNDAMENTALS ELECT ; Baser M, 2010, EURASIA J MATH SCI T, V6, P4; DIRECTOR SW, 1995, P IEEE, V83, P1246, DOI 10.1109/5.40642; Engelhardt PV, 2004, AM J PHYS, V72, P98, DOI 10.1119/1.161481; Frederiksen JR, 1999, J RES SCI TEACH, V36, P806, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2736(199909)36:7<806::AID-TEA5>3.0.CO;2-; Geban O., 2008, RES SCI TECHNOLOGICA, V25, P243, DOI [https://doi.org/10.1080/02635140701250857, DOI 10.1080/02635140701250857; Gunstone R, 2009, RES SCI EDUC, V39, P515, DOI 10.1007/s11165-008-9092-; Hart C, 2008, RES SCI EDUC, V38, P529, DOI 10.1007/s11165-007-9060-; Jaakkola T, 2010, USE EXTERNAL REPRESE, P13; Jaakkola T, 2011, J RES SCI TEACH, V48, P71, DOI 10.1002/tea.2038; Jacob J.

According to the student feedback, this approach allowed gathering his main interests - vector control, microcontroller programming and wind power generation - together, therefore reinforcing his motivation towards his final year project and making him feel particularly responsible for its outcome. Microcontroller-based hardware-in-the-loop emulation made possible to combine the three afore-cited student interests. In this context, the virtual prototype of a current-controlled wind turbine-driven 2-MW permanent-magnet synchronous generator is presented, along with the pseudo-code corresponding to the permanent-magnet synchronous generator speed control algorithm programmed in an 8-bit microcontroller. In addition, tuning formulas are derived for the digital integral-proportional controllers commanding both the permanent-magnet synchronous generator current and speed. Detailed descriptions are provided in order to guarantee reproducibility. Implementation of the hardware-in-the-loop rig is also tackled, supported by illustrative results obtained when running it. The developed hardware-in-the-loop rig is considered suitable for laboratory practices of subjects like digital control and microcontroller programming.","[Larruscain, Gorka; Tapia, Gerardo; Susperregui, Ana; Itsaso Martinez, M.] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Fac Engn, Dept Automat Control & Syst Engn, San Sebastian, Spain","Tapia, G (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Fac Engn, Plaza Europa 1, San Sebastian 20018, Spain.",gerardo.tapia@ehu.eus,"Tapia, Gerardo/P-4160-2017; Susperregui, Ana/Q-9323-2018; Martínez, Miren Itsaso/ABF-1201-2020","Tapia, Gerardo/0000-0002-6224-9595; Susperregui, Ana/0000-0002-0803-7049; Martinez Aguirre, Miren Itsaso/0000-0002-3286-6744",,,"Baltic M, 2014, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V51, P204, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.51.3.; Fragoso S, 2016, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC, V24, P400, DOI 10.1002/cae.2171; Geng H, 2009, IET RENEW POWER GEN, V3, P168, DOI 10.1049/iet-rpg:2007004; Goodwin GC, 2011, IEEE T EDUC, V54, P48, DOI 10.1109/TE.2010.204343; Gunasekaran M, 2012, IEEE T EDUC, V55, P508, DOI 10.1109/TE.2012.219244; Ibrahim D, 2003, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V40, P175, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.40.3.; Ibrahim D., 2006, MICROCONTROLLER BAS; KUO BC, 1992, DIGITAL CONTROL SYS; Montesinos-Miracle D, 2009, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V46, P183, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.46.2.; Ogata K., 2001, MODERN CONTROL ENG, V4t; Rodriguez-Ponce R, 2015, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V52, P219, DOI 10.1177/002072091557592; Rodriguez-Resendiz J, 2011, IEEE T EDUC, V54, P657, DOI 10.1109/TE.2011.210621; Short M, 2011, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V48, P339, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.48.4.; Tapia G, 2006, IEEE T ENERGY CONVER, V21, P909, DOI 10.1109/TEC.2005.85997; TOLIYAT HA, 2004, POW ELE APP, pNIL; Troni G, 2013, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V50, P395, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.50.4.; Vas P., 1998, SENSORLESS VECTOR D; Welch T.

The industrial field trip was organized in the early weeks of the engineering education course. Participating in an industrial field trip is a formal requirement of an engineering education program. After each course, the experience in organizing field trips is reflected and modified continuously to increase the effectiveness in the introduction to engineering for students. A process of organizing the industrial field trips has been developed to increase the effectiveness of education, which includes three main stages: (1) classroom activities to prepare for the field trip, (2) implementation of the field trip, and (3) reflections on the field trip experience. Results showed that the industrial field trips enhance the emotions of students about an engineering education field.

One of these is the harmonic oscillators that generate an output sinusoidal signal. Due to the advantages of these, this paper proposes a methodology based on an analysis based on the dynamical system theory. This provides undergraduates a useful tool for a better understanding of the harmonic oscillators in order to design and implement accurately this kind of circuits. This tool complements the widely recognized Barkhausen criterion, which is a mathematical condition that must be satisfied by linear feedback oscillators. The analysis based on the dynamical system theory consists of obtaining a state matrix and its eigenvalues from the mathematical model of the oscillator circuits. The eigenvalues are adjusted to get an oscillator system, thus from this way, a set of conditions are derived. These conditions are complementary to those obtained by the Barkhausen criterion.","[Salas-Castro, Pablo; Delgado-Aranda, Finees; Tristan-Hernandez, Edgar; Campos-Canton, Isaac] UASLP, Fac Ciencias, Inst Invest Comunicac Opt, San Luis Potosi, Slp, Mexico; [Martinez-Montejano, Roberto C.] UASLP, Unidad Acad Multidisciplinaria Zona Media, San Luis Potosi, Slp, Mexico; [Murguia, J.

These three aspects are core to disassembly-assembly techniques used in higher education where students are required to engage with visual, auditory and kinesthetic learning within a laboratory environment. The purpose of this article is to describe a disassembly-assembly technique used in a compulsory engineering module and identify how many African engineering students can successfully create a problem (disassemble a two-stroke motor) and then correctly solve the problem (assemble the two-stroke motor back to a working condition). A longitudinal study involving quantitative data is used with descriptive statistics. Results indicate, that on average, 85.5% of African engineering students can successfully engage with the disassembly-assembly technique. A possible recommendation is to encourage more academics to make use of the disassembly-assembly technique with regard to engineering systems, equipment or machinery.","[Swart, Arthur J.] Cent Univ Technol, Elect Elect & Comp Engn, Bloemfontein, South Africa","Swart, AJ (corresponding author), Cent Univ Technol, Private Bag X20539, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, Free State, South Africa.",drjarnesswart@gmail.com,"Swart, Arthur James/AAC-4542-2020","Swart, James/0000-0001-5906-2896",National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa [106017],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is based on the research supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa (Grant Number: 106017).","Ahn B, 2013, PROC FRONT EDUC CON; AlHumoud S, 2014, GLOB ENG ED C EDUCO; Basart JM, 2015, TELEMAT INFORM, V32, P409, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2014.05.00; Battle B., 2015, DIFFERENTIATING SC; Biggs J., 2011, TEACHING QUALITY LE; Bloom B.

Regarding developments on the practical side, however, a networked control system is still wanting when it comes to experimental platforms suitable for research and educational purposes, which contributes to most of networked control system theory being validated by means of numerical examples and simulations. This paper addresses this issue by presenting a low-cost real-time networked control system platform, based on custom hardware and software solutions that can be readily explored with the sole use of a web browser connected to the Internet. The technical decisions made during development represent a fundamentally novel take on networked control system experimental platforms that can potentially be reproduced by several universities. The platform provides the user with multiple controller and input reference options, network configurations, delay statistics, and even a downloadable file containing advanced experiment data. A survey conducted with students located over 1200 km away from the platform who used it during laboratory assignments highlight the system's usability and interactivity, and supports the platform is suitable for educational purposes.","[Cavalcanti, Joao; Santana, Pedro Hrqa] MIT, Dept Aeronaut & Astronaut, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Figueredo, Luis Fc; Ishihara, Joao Y.; Bernardes, Mariana C.; Borges, Geovany A.] Univ Brasilia, Dept Elect Engn, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Figueredo, Luis Fc] Univ Leeds, Sch Comp, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Vargas, Alessandro N.] Univ Tecnol Fed Parana, Electrotech Dept, Cornelio Procopio, Brazil","Cavalcanti, J (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Aeronaut & Astronaut, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",cavalcanti.vilela@gmail.com,"Borges, Geovany A/G-4431-2013; Bernardes, Mariana/ABE-2103-2020; Ishihara, Joao Yoshiyuki/AAJ-8408-2020; Vargas, Alessandro do Nascimento/AAQ-8396-2020; Figueredo, Luis F.

Problem identification and formulation, applying mathematical and engineering knowledge for solving a problem, and design and synthesis of the final product are some of the outcomes that the students achieve upon completing such projects. In this paper, the design of an electrodynamic suspension system, in which an aluminium disc suspended above two concentric coils, is considered. The mathematical description is presented and proved that the value of electromagnetic force exerted on the disc is proportional to the inverse square of its height. The system is then simulated with a finite element method software and the effects of varying different system's parameters on the exerted force are studied through simulation results. Analytical calculations and simulation results are validated by being compared with experimental measurements, which show a close agreement.","[Ghayoor, Farzad; Swanson, A.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Elect Elect & Comp Engn, Durban, South Africa","Ghayoor, F (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Howard Coll, Elect Elect & Comp Engn, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa.",ghayoor@ukzn.ac.za,,"Ghayoor, Farzad/0000-0001-5780-6767; Swanson, Andrew/0000-0002-9965-4746",,,"[Anonymous], 2014, E02PE ENG COUNC S A; Barry N, 2012, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V44, P28; Bussy BR, 2017, P 25 SO AFR U POW EN, P12; Cazacu E, 2006, REV ROUMAINE SCI TEC, V51, P27; Branco PJC, 2010, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V47, P380, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.47.4.; Earnshaw S., 1839, SOC, V7, P9; LAITHWAITE ER, 1965, P I ELECTR ENG, V112, P2361, DOI 10.1049/piee.1965.039; LeeKim HK, 2006, IEEE T MAGN, V42, P191; Liu HJ, 2017, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V54, P341, DOI 10.1177/002072091769465; Meeker D.C., 2006, FINITE ELEMENT METH; Oka K, 1996, ELECT ENG JPN, V116, P29; Riba JR, 2017, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V54, P35, DOI 10.1177/002072091665950; Santisteban JA, 2012, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V44, P23; Suresh S, 2015, INT INNOVAT RES J EN, V1, P1; Thompson MT, 2000, IEEE POTENTIALS, V19, P40, DOI 10.1109/45.82564",15,4,4,1,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The autonomous audio heater car is a comprehensive project-based analog design experience within a conceive, design, implement, operate framework. The students participate in the overall design process with guided discovery, rather than merely conducting scripted laboratory exercises. Students develop an understanding of the analog design required for each subsystem through weekly individual pre-laboratory and laboratory exercises. The car is guided to a beacon by light and/or audio tone. In transit, the car heats water to a temperature corresponding to the beacon tone and emits a tone corresponding to the instantaneous water temperature. The project culminates with team-based system integration and a competition. The individual work serves to cross-train all of the team members such that they all contribute effectively in the teams. The project motivated students because it provided a framework for laboratory topics, which would typically be considered without the broader context of a system design introduced at the beginning of the course.","[LeBoeuf, Richard L.] Univ Los Andes, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, Santiago, Chile; [Gomez, Jorge T.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Dept Ingn Elect, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile","Gomez, JT (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Dept Ingn Elect, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",jtgomez1@uc.cl,,"LeBoeuf, Richard/0000-0002-0427-6069",,,"Ahlgren DJ, 2013, INT J SOC ROBOT, V5, P127, DOI 10.1007/s12369-011-0137-; Amiel F, 2014, IEEE COMMUN MAG, V52, P98, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2014.697995; Arbelaitz O, 2015, IEEE T EDUC, V58, P110, DOI 10.1109/TE.2014.233244; Becker JP, 2014, IEEE T EDUC, V57, P75, DOI 10.1109/TE.2013.227331; Beer RD, 1999, COMMUN ACM, V42, P85, DOI 10.1145/303849.30386; Bhatti PT, 2011, IEEE T EDUC, V54, P628, DOI 10.1109/TE.2010.210331; Borrego M, 2013, J ENG EDUC, V102, P472, DOI 10.1002/jee.2002; Bruce JW, 2004, IEEE T EDUC, V47, P83, DOI 10.1109/TE.2003.81761; Calnon M, 2012, GLOBAL J ENG ED, V14, P; Cappelleri DJ, 2013, IEEE T EDUC, V56, P73, DOI 10.1109/TE.2012.221532; Carpeno A, 2011, IEEE T EDUC, V54, P229, DOI 10.1109/TE.2010.204875; Chang GW, 2008, IEEE T EDUC, V51, P220, DOI 10.1109/TE.2007.90732; Chu RH, 2008, IEEE T EDUC, V51, P108, DOI 10.1109/TE.2007.90660; Costa LRJ, 2007, IEEE T EDUC, V50, P41, DOI 10.1109/TE.2006.88645; Dal M, 2013, IEEE T EDUC, V56, P459, DOI 10.1109/TE.2013.225642; Dym CL, 2005, J ENG EDUC, V94, P103, DOI 10.1002/j.2168-9830.2005.tb00832.; Feisel LD, 2005, J ENG EDUC, V94, P121, DOI 10.1002/j.2168-9830.2005.tb00833.; Felder RM, 2004, J ENG EDUC, V93, P279, DOI 10.1002/j.2168-9830.2004.tb00817.; Fuhrmann T, 2015, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V52, P287, DOI 10.1177/002072091558386; Paneda XG, 2013, IEEE REV IBEROAM TEC, V8, P39, DOI 10.1109/RITA.2013.224469; Gary K, 2015, COMPUTER, V48, P98, DOI 10.1109/MC.2015.26; Hassan H, 2015, IEEE T EDUC, V58, P167, DOI 10.1109/TE.2014.234853; Hosseinzadeh N, 2012, IEEE T EDUC, V55, P495, DOI 10.1109/TE.2012.219158; Jonassen D, 2006, J ENG EDUC, V95, P139, DOI 10.1002/j.2168-9830.2006.tb00885.; Jung S, 2013, IEEE T EDUC, V56, P129, DOI 10.1109/TE.2012.221360; Kim J, 2012, IEEE T EDUC, V55, P145, DOI 10.1109/TE.2011.215679; Lamar DG, 2012, IEEE T EDUC, V55, P69, DOI 10.1109/TE.2011.212061; Litzinger T., 2011, J ENG EDUC, V100, P123, DOI [10.1002/j.2168-9830.2011.tb00006.x, DOI 10.1002/J.2168-9830.2011.TB00006.X; Mantri A, 2008, IEEE T EDUC, V51, P432, DOI 10.1109/TE.2007.91252; Martinez F, 2011, IEEE T EDUC, V54, P87, DOI 10.1109/TE.2010.204450; Maskell DL, 1998, IEEE T EDUC, V41, P101, DOI 10.1109/13.66971; Max L, 2009, IEEE T EDUC, V52, P524, DOI 10.1109/TE.2008.93051; Munoz-Merino PJ, 2014, IEEE T EDUC, V57, P182, DOI 10.1109/TE.2013.229731; O'Connell RM, 2015, IEEE T EDUC, V58, P90, DOI 10.1109/TE.2014.232965; Oakley Barbara., 2004, J STUDENT CENTERED L, V2, P; Prince M, 2004, J ENG EDUC, V93, P223, DOI 10.1002/j.2168-9830.2004.tb00809.; Prince MJ, 2006, J ENG EDUC, V95, P123, DOI 10.1002/j.2168-9830.2006.tb00884.; Rengel R, 2012, IEEE T EDUC, V55, P525, DOI 10.1109/TE.2012.219429; Troni G, 2013, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V50, P395, DOI 10.7227/IJEEE.50.4.; Yadav A, 2011, J ENG EDUC, V100, P253, DOI 10.1002/j.2168-9830.2011.tb00013.; ZHU JJ, 1994, IEEE CONTR SYST MAG, V14, P64, DOI 10.1109/37.32089",41,8,8,1,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The measurement system consists of an AC/DC voltmeter and a universal resistive/capacitive high voltage divider. The voltmeter shows measured voltage values based on the scale factor of the voltage divider. The divider ensures a stable capacitance for AC voltage measurements and an additional resistive parallel path for DC voltage measurements. Both the divider and the voltmeter are calibrated in AC and DC modes. All uncertainty components are taken into account to obtain measured values with an acceptable accuracy. The calibration results in traceability to the national standards, which make measurements using the international system of units. The proposed calibration method is useful for the theory and practice of high voltage measurements in education, industrial applications, and electrical metrology studies.","[Mageed, Hala M.

The authors of this paper were prompted to propose changes to the teaching of a final year control unit of a BEng (Hons) Degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering after numerous students had expressed concern about their ability to be successful in this subject. The average exam grade had also been low for several years. Teaching previously had been didactic in nature, based on lectures, predefined laboratory exercises and tutorial sessions. Use of appropriate-based workshop study sessions can lead to higher levels of attainment and development, and student perception is that the experience is informal, engaging but appropriately challenging. A series of workshop sessions were introduced into term two of the unit teaching over a period of several weeks. Students worked individually on learning improvement activities, within cooperative groups in an informal workshop environment. The tasks set to the students were challenging and designed to improve general skills in Control, and students were encouraged to explore further areas that interested them. Results presented in this paper describe an improvement in student engagement, confidence in exam preparation and communication of learning measured by grades since the introduction of the workshop sessions, and improved feedback from students. The workshop sessions were integrated into the teaching scheme rather than being elective and did not require any additional timetable sessions.","[Twigg, Peter; Ponnapalli, Prasad; Fowler, Margaret] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Engn, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England","Twigg, P (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Engn, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England.",p.twigg@mmu.ac.uk,,"Twigg, Peter/0000-0001-8772-8384",,,"Arendale D.

The available open access tools are commonly focused on transmission network analysis. On the other hand, commercial tools adapted to radial networks do not allow the students to follow the intermediary calculations and learn with them. In many cases, the students have to develop their own computational tools, which is a time-consuming activity. This paper aims to fill the gap encountered by undergraduate and graduate students when they are performing their optimization problems involving distributed generation units, presenting the advantages of a new power flow tool focused on radial electrical distribution networks with high levels of unbalanced loads which require a three-phase power flow tool to be analyzed.

The proposed educational method combines theoretical, simulation and experimental approaches with the purpose of a higher-level knowledge achievement. Several exercises have been defined and implemented in the teaching process. Some characteristic overhead transmission line steady state regimes, such as Ferranti effect, natural load flow and capacitive overhead transmission line behaviour, have been analysed. The special analysis has been carried out in order to determine the basic characteristics of the switching transients. Software package MATLAB/Simulink has been used for the estimation of system parameters and for the simulation analysis. Different overhead transmission line models have been compared and useful modelling guidelines have been recommended. Experimental calculations have been performed by using a physically scaled system consisting of multiple Pi sections representing 100 km length 400 kV overhead transmission line. The proposed method has been tested within High Voltage Engineering undergraduate course and useful application feedback from students has been obtained.","[Forcan, Miodrag] Univ Belgrade, Fac Elect Engn, Belgrade, Serbia; [Forcan, Miodrag; Banjanin, Mladen; Vukovic, Goran] Univ East Sarajevo, Fac Elect Engn, East Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg","Forcan, M (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Sch Elect Engn, Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra 73, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",miodrag.forcan@etf.unssa.rs.ba,"Banjanin, Mladen Svetozar/AAD-9818-2019; Forcan, Miodrag/AAZ-7502-2021","Banjanin, Mladen/0000-0002-9797-5386",,,"[Anonymous], 2004, 600714 IE; [Anonymous], MATLAB SI; [Anonymous], 1998, PESTR7 IEE; Banjanin M, 2015, INT J ELEC ENG EDUC, V52, P340, DOI 10.1177/002072091558810; Bergen A, 2000, POWER SYSTEMS ANAL, P4; Canadian-American EMTP User Group, 2011, ATP RUL BOO; CIGRE, 1990, GUID REPR NETW EL C; DIgSILENT, VERS 14 0 52; Hileman A., 1999, INSULATION COORDINA; Kiessling F, 2014, OVERHEAD POWER LINES, P2; Seyedi H, 2013, IET GENER TRANSM DIS, V7, P218, DOI 10.1049/iet-gtd.2012.028; Shahnia F, 2016, IEEE T EDUC, V59, P81, DOI 10.1109/TE.2015.244861; Shenkman A., 2005, TRANSIENT ANAL ELECT, P32; Tleis N., 2008, POWER SYSTEMS MODELL, P3; Vahidi B, 2010, INT J ENG EDUC, V26, P135; Wood R.J.C., 1925, Journal of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, V44, P121; Yuan J., 2011, IEEE T POWER DELIV, V27, P112, DOI [10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2172696, DOI 10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2172696",17,4,4,1,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The educational tool comprises a graphical user interface in MATLAB. The graphical user interface permits an individual to investigate various parameters involved in the design of the required compensator, which includes percentage overshoot, peak time, and velocity error constant and observe the results dynamically as the parameters change. The approach used in this article for the design of compensators is based on the frequency response analysis. One can obtain various plots including unit step response plot, Bode plot, and root locus plot for uncompensated and compensated systems to have a better understanding of the designed compensator.","[Yadav, Drishti; Patel, R.
