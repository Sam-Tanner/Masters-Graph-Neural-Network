AB Although literary translation and aesthetics belong to different categories, they are inextricably linked. No matter what kind of language is the target of literary translation, it will be branded with relevant aesthetic thoughts to a great extent. This phenomenon can be seen everywhere in the field of literary translation in the East and the West. There are similarities between Chinese and Western aesthetics, for example, their origins are related to philosophy, and they are inseparable from literary aesthetics; there are also differences certainly, such as different psychological origins, different characteristics of development track, different attention to beauty, different methodology and so on. Through the comparative analysis of the similarities and differences between the two sides in aesthetic ideas, this paper aims to enhance its guiding role in translation practice.

AB With the rapid development of computer technology and the Internet, mobile learning in AT teaching mode has become the most popular concept and technology in the IT field. It can be said that mobile learning in AT teaching mode is closely related to people's daily life, so the AT teaching mode Mobile learning has received a high degree of attention.This paper constructs the inquiry teaching mode and framework, and explores the effective ML method based on AT mode, so as to improve students' apos; learning performance and learning interest, so as to improve the teaching effect and teaching quality. In this paper, the evaluation-based information teaching mode AT mode is constructed, which provides support for teaching, and studies the learning interest based on AT mode. This study takes the change of students' apos; interest as the breakthrough point, and on the basis of traditional teaching mode, using the methods of literature, experiment and mathematical statistics, taking the students of our university as the research object, this paper adopts the preset model and measures and analyzes the data with the help of measurement tools. On the basis of ensuring its good reliability and validity, the students apos; interest is tested. The results show that ML based on AT mode can improve students' apos; academic performance, and the improvement degree is related to the difficulty of learning content and students apos; learning level. It shows that mathematical modeling based on the AT model can help students understand knowledge, reduce learning difficulty, and increase learning interest. It also proves that student performance and learning interest interact and promote each other.

AB With the continuous development and progress of society, the reform of higher education is gradually unfolding, and colleges and universities are responsible for the development of education. From the perspective of students' cognition, understanding the law of the occurrence and development of students' cognition is conducive to change the traditional rigid management mode to the development of flexible management mode. In addition, it also meets the requirements of student management to take into account students' cognitive and human needs, and provides guidance for student management in the new era, and enriches the theoretical basis of student management. Based on the educational cognitive theory, this paper conducts a questionnaire survey on College Students' management, and uses SPSS software to analyze the survey data, so as to measure the satisfaction of various management work, and to study the influence of cognitive theory on the management mode of college students in the new period. In the process of design, the questionnaire focuses on students' self-cognition and social cognition, especially the cognition of "the other" in students' social cognition, that is, the cognition of student management work and the cognition of student management workers. The results of the questionnaire survey show that there is a difference between students' self-perception and the cognition of others, and students' cognitive characteristics determine how to manage students. Student management workers need to improve the role of "advisors, mentors and helpful friends". The cognitive characteristics of students determine the changes in student management. The cognitive needs of students determine the content of student management; the cognitive level of students accounts for 34% of the effectiveness of student management.

AB With the advent of the Internet age, network information technology is rapidly entering college English classes, which fundamentally changes the mode of college English teaching. In college English classroom teaching mode, as a brand teaching form, College English multimedia network teaching environment has brought advantages to classroom teaching, but also brought about impacts on teaching concepts, teaching models, teaching methods and other aspects. There are some phenomena that are inconsistent with the reform model at the students, teachers and the environment. The balance of traditional English classroom teaching has been broken, which has affected the smooth progress of college business English classroom teaching mode reform. It is very important to analyze and resolve these imbalances and find ecological methods for optimizing university English education. In this context, the advent of multimedia-assisted education technology has provided better conditions for the implementation of Business English classroom education in universities.

AB The purpose of this study is to explore the stability and interaction between parental pressure and social research report, as well as the role of employment status and family income levels in this process. This study used a special study on Korean children (PSKC) 2-4 waves. Use t-test, correlation and autoregressive cross-delay modeling to analyze the data. The main findings of this study are: First, over time, parental pressure and mother's social research report are consistent. Secondly, the pressure of motherhood and childcare has an obvious lagging effect on upbringing, and vice versa. Third, there is no significant difference between working mothers and non-working mothers in terms of the stability of working parents' pressure, social research report and social research report for children's pressure channels. However, parental pressure can only predict the social research report of working mothers. Fourth, there is no significant difference between the stability and interaction of these two structures in household income levels. In short, the results show that, over time, parental pressure is consistent with mother's social research report. The results also show that there is a significant cross-lag effect between the mothers' perceptions of mutual pressure analysis. In the process from parental pressure to social research report, I found the difference between working and non-working mothers. The advantage of this study is that the expected longitudinal design was adopted during infancy and the priority between the two structures can be considered. The results of this study can be used as a source of intervention plans to help parents withstand severe parenting pressure and lack of social research report.

AB The emergence of multimedia has created a new teaching vitality for the development of English teaching, and at the same time stimulated students' interest in learning and made the whole classroom more diverse and interesting. It is a new way for people to use modern technology to assist teaching. This article proposes CD-ROM self-learning and face-to-face teaching to guide and inspire multimedia teaching. Studying the type, construction and function of interactive English teaching mode in multimedia environment is of great significance to the reform of English teaching in colleges and universities. Therefore, it is necessary for teachers engaged in open English teaching to explore suitable combination of human-machine and English-based teaching modes based on network multimedia independent learning and face-to-face teaching. The novelty of this article is based on the experience of full-time colleges and universities, and considering the particularity of college English teaching, a teaching model based on open English multimedia CD-ROM and face-to-face teaching was constructed. Based on language input theory, this research fully considers the central role of students, uses a set of multimedia CD-ROM autonomous learning system while teaching face-to-face, integrates tests and questionnaires, carries out a year-long teaching experiment. The experimental results show that it is an effective open English teaching model.

AB With the development of economy, society and science and technology, the disadvantages of the traditional "subject based" curriculum system construction mode are increasingly apparent. Graduates go to the society, what they learn is not what they use. There is a phenomenon that education and employment deviate from each other. Even if they have a job, they have to learn again, which requires a longer adaptation period. According to the skills and abilities that human resource management (HRM) students may enter into after graduation, a targeted modular teaching system is constructed. The modular teaching system can carry out customized learning in advance according to the students' work goals, and grasp the required employability in advance. At the same time, the reform of the system also enriches the teaching methods of teachers. Through the questionnaire and experimental test, this paper finds that: modular teaching breaks the traditional curriculum design method under the framework of the discipline theoretical system, aims to cultivate students' professional ability, improve their adaptability to the job, and further enhance their practical employability. Experimental results: the relationship between the quality characteristics and academic performance of HRM students was verified, and the relationship between them and the influence model of causality were clarified. The results of the two classes are similar in the pre-test; and from the back results, we can see that the scores of the experimental class after the use of modular teaching are significantly improved, while the comparison class is not significantly improved compared with before the experiment, which fully shows that the implementation of modular teaching can help students improve their comprehensive performance. The path coefficient of growth driven to academic performance is 0.428, the path coefficient of learning development to academic performance is 0.122, and interpersonal skills affect academic performance indirectly. It fully verifies the relationship between the quality characteristic model and academic performance, and shows that the quality characteristic model constructed is relatively perfect and can be used as a reference for students' evaluation.

DE Output oriented education concept; moral education; teaching reform;
   moral education curriculum reform
AB In order to keep up with the pace of the times, we should infiltrate the output oriented teaching concept into the teaching reform of moral education course, so as to improve students' knowledge ability and moral quality. On the basis of existing scholars' research, this paper expounds the three characteristics of output oriented education concept: learning as the center; emphasizing the integration of learning and application; paying attention to the whole person education. And through the research on the main problems existing in the current moral education curriculum teaching, it is found that the teaching methods are backward, the curriculum is few, and the teaching materials are unrealistic. This has led to the unsatisfactory effect of the moral education curriculum. This paper analyzes the causes of these problems, and uses the method of questionnaire survey to investigate the current situation of moral education teaching in a university in our city. The survey results show that most teachers and students think that moral education course is of great significance, but they are not interested in it. In view of the problems reflected in the survey results, this paper finally puts forward the following suggestions for reference: integrating teaching content, innovating teaching forms; strengthening the construction of teaching staff; effectively connecting the curriculum system and learning outcomes.

AB Specialized project design (SPD) is a compulsory course for most of the engineering students in China. A SPD course requires teamwork of students. It is therefore an important issue about how to group students in a more reasonable form to increase students' interest in the course and improve their performance. However, at present, it remains a challenge to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of group teaching and optimize group teaching through state-of-the-art methods such as artificial intelligence. In this study, we propose a qualitative analysis method to study the group teaching of students through teacher's subjective evaluation of different aspects of students' abilities. In particular, the proposed method is a background-based grouping method which takes into account the students' scores attained in prerequisite courses of a SPD course and realized by a genetic algorithm. Results of our experiment demonstrate that, compared with the conventional random grouping method, the proposed method improves the students' average scores in all eight SPD topics by 2.5 in the grade 2016 and 1.875 in grade 2017, respectively (the total score is 100). Therefore, our findings strongly support that grouping students based on their strengths (for example, the courses they are good at) can enhance students' interest in the SPD course and thereby improve students' SPD performance.

ID PROVISION
AB In this paper, from the perspective of safety education, we focus on sports the optimization strategy of curriculum teaching is studied. This paper adopts the methods of questionnaire survey and control experiment. In the study, 770 students' acceptance of safety education and acceptance content were investigated. At the same time, the students were divided into control group and experimental group. In addition, we use the adjustment processing method to analyze the experimental data, through the analysis of the students' safety knowledge, obstacle ability, attitude and frequency of participating in sports activities, and the preferred sports project selection. The results show that 62.1% and 36.6% of the subjects in the control group like and prefer to participate in sports activities, while 75.4% and 81.6% of the subjects in the experimental group like to participate in sports activities and prefer to participate in sports activities, Therefore, safety education can not only help students acquire safety knowledge and skills, but also improve students' enthusiasm to participate in sports activities.

AB In 2020, the epidemic spread rapidly and frightening. During the period of epidemic prevention and control, college students did not go out and lived in isolation at home, so some students had mental health problems, such as the lack of normal face-to-face social interaction, the unmet need to talk; family contradictions occurred from time to time, resulting in large fluctuations in college students' mental health. This paper analyzes the causes of college students' psychological problems under the background of the epidemic situation, and carries out the experimental data collection and statistical analysis in the form of scale test and telephone interview. The results show that college students are prone to psychological problems in the context of the epidemic, and senior students and female students are more likely to have psychological problems. This paper provides a theoretical basis for solving the mental health problems of college students, and has important reference significance.

AB The operation and maintenance of sports venues is the basis of ensuring the orderly organization of various events in large-scale comprehensive sports games. Due to the lack of evaluation methods and an index system, it was difficult to predict the input of operating and managing sports venues in large-scale comprehensive sports games. Excessive manpower is often put to guarantee the smooth operation work, causing the problem of waste on all resources. Based on the practice of the operational work for specified sports fields during the 7th World Army Games, this paper establishes a staffing allocation model for the maintenance and operation of sports venues. On the premise of building up a clear maintenance scope, a clarified organization structure and working procedure, the maintenance index of 15 specified venues is evaluated with analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and a set of allocation criteria of the operation team is put forward. The maintenance coefficients of studied venues range from 0.08 to 0.91, and the venues with highest coefficients are the main stadium, the naval pentathlon venues and the soccer field, etc.

AB Sport plays an integral role in schooling institutions. It has hitherto been part of the curriculum, right from kindergarten, to the higher institutions of learning like colleges and universities. It is thus imperative to form a concrete system that will ensure its smooth operation. The School sports management system is efficient with this respect. The School Sports management system (SSMS) is a set of protocols, procedures, and techniques used in educational institutions to ensure that all the activities run conclusively and smoothly. In sports and sporting activities, numerous reforms are always put in place and implemented to establish and improve the operational processes. An existing SSMS should accommodate these reforms and incorporate them into school sports and physical education curricula, which is the objective of this paper. This paper aims at discussing how the SSMS can adapt to sports reforms and If the school wants to reform the function of physical education, it needs to innovate the sports management system. At present, there are many drawbacks in school physical education. The following problems hinder the development of school physical education to a great extent. First, the related funds of school physical education subjects are obviously insufficient, the related expenses of physical education subjects account for a small proportion of the total funds of the school. Compared with the growth of the total funds of the school, the proportion is small, the equipment is not updated in a timely manner, and the development of physical education subjects mainly depends on the school allocation, which makes it difficult to form a benign fundraising mechanism. Second, the allocation of resources in the use of school physical education funds is not reasonable, and the allocation among teaching, scientific research and training expenses of sports teams is not appropriate. Third, the physical education departments of colleges and universities lack rational and scientific management, and lack of vitality within the departments, which to a large extent hinders the effective play of physical education functions. Therefore, in view of the above problems, this paper puts forward several principles that should be followed in the development of sports management system in the future.accustom to the changes. We discuss the importance of a management system in school sports explicitly, expounding on its operation. We then provide a listing of the reforms sports have encountered in recent times and how they can be integrated into the school curriculum.

AB China is the world's largest exporter, and is also one of the few economies that have successfully transitioned from central-planned to market-oriented economy. In this paper, we analyze the effect of China's official export credit insurance on Chinese exports to countries in the world. We describes the background of official export insurance in general and the development of China's ECI. Meanwhile, we discuss the data and model used to examine the relationship between China's ECIs and exports. We estimate both the static and dynamic gravity models where exports are a function of country size, transportation costs, and country-risk. Our results of static model suggest that that a 1 percent increase in China's official ECI coverage stimulates its exports volume by 0.34 percent. Furthermore, Chinese companies export 1.5 times more to countries with ECIs than to those countries where ECIs are not available. Our estimates from the dynamic model are similar to the static model, to a lesser extent, of ECI impacts on exports to trading partners.

AB With the rapid development of Internet technology in China, mechanical drawing plays a more and more important role in social development and practice. The main purpose is to use the course of mechanical drawing to accurately represent the appearance, size, principle and technology of the machine. It is often called the language of communication in the industry. In order to make mechanical drawing better applied and practiced, and to make maximum use of Internet technical resources, the establishment of multimedia courseware teaching mechanism is the development trend of mechanical drawing.In order to adapt to the trend of network information, based on the multimedia environment, this paper studies the application of animation technology in mechanical drawing teaching, and constructs a small multimedia teaching platform. Through the explanation of animation courseware, students can better understand the making and principle of mechanical drawing, and cultivate students' divergent thinking. The teaching platform combines teaching material knowledge with practice to deepen students' understanding of the basic content of mechanical drawing. Finally, the rationality and practicability of the system are analyzed by investigating the platform users. The results show that the application of animation technology in mechanical drawing teaching is reasonable and practical.

AB Objective
   Parents' labor migration has resulted in a great quantity of Left Behind Adolescents (LBA) in China. This study aims to examine if childhood trauma and internet addiction does predict depression on LBA in comparison to Non-Left Behind Adolescents (NLBA) in China.
   Methods
   Participants in the study includes a sample of 1890 adolescents aged 12 to 27, including 102 LBA and 1399 NLBA in China. All participants completed the self-report questionnaires, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-28), Internet Addiction Test (IAT), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).
   Results
   There was a significant difference in IAT and CTQ between LBA and NLBA (P < 0.05). The frequent childhood trauma type was physical neglect (48%), followed by emotional neglect (32.3%). Males reported higher levels of emotional and physical abuse and physical neglect than female counterparts in LBA. The prevalence of depression (23.5%) and internet addiction (29.4%) were higher among LBA than NLBA. There were no significant differences in depression (p > 0.05). There were positive correlations between CTQ (except emotional neglect), BDI, and IAT. Multiple linear regressions indicated that emotional abuse and neglect, internet addiction, and poor academic performance were significant predictors for depression among LBA.
   Conclusion
   Childhood trauma and internet addiction were directly related to symptoms of depression in LBA, There is an urgent need for targeted interventions for LBA to prevent negative mental health outcomes.

   microelectronics
AB This paper describes observations and experiences collected during 14 years of running the "Integrated circuits" course in the framework of a distance learning program. The main objective of the "Integrated circuits" course is to raise the interest in microelectronics, convince the students that IC design is not a "secret science" requiring extraordinary talent and prepare the students for continuation toward M.Sc. degree. The course includes a mixture of teaching materials available online for self-studying, short video files, interactive self-tests, two "hands on" exercises and educational software needed for these exercises. E-mail and/or phone consultations, face-to-face or online meetings with the instructor are possible. About 1/3 of all students enrolled for the distance learning course perceive the "Integrated circuits" course as interesting, praise the design exercises and ask if it would be possible to continue education in microelectronic design at a more advanced level. Unfortunately distance learning at advanced level is not possible, mainly because professional design software can be used only on site, not remotely.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Economic value of agricultural water; the perspective of crops;
   irrigated water requirement; acid areas
AB This paper aims to estimate the economic value of agricultural water use in Arizona based on an improved economic value estimation model (EVIW model). In this research, EVIW method is optimized for the economic value estimation of agricultural water use from the perspective of crops. Crop Price per unit for crop production, crop yield per acre and irrigation area are used to calculate gross profit. Crop variable costs per acre (labor costs, chemical costs, machinery fuel and repair costs, etc.) and corresponding irrigation areas are used to calculate variable costs. Gross revenues and variable costs are used to calculate the net returns generated by irrigation water. Arizona agricultural water use for crops are estimated based on meteorological data and Cropland Data Layers. Finally, economic values of agricultural water are determined by the net returns of irrigated crops and agricultural water use. The results show that the economic values of agricultural water are positive and negative with great variations. The models applied in the research bring forward practical conclusions for further water allocations, transfer, and policies.

DE Judicial examination; reform; legal education; education mode
AB Judicial examination has existed in our country for many years. For law students, the judicial examination is an important examination of their career. By the end of 2015, the state has put forward the objectives and tasks of improving the national legal professional qualification system. In August 2017, the judicial examination was reformed in the draft of the 8 judicial amendments, such as the Judge Law. This puts forward new requirements for the cultivation of the practical ability of law students. Judicial examination is an important link between law education and legal profession, and has an important influence on the undergraduate education of law. Legal education is an important part of higher education. It is an educational activity with the content of imparting legal knowledge, training legal thinking and cultivating qualified legal professionals. However, the cultivation of legal professionals is not the only goal of law education. Under the background judicial examination reform, it is necessary to explore the legal undergraduate education model, change the concept of legal education and cultivate national application talents.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB The Harmonics control of any inverters can be decided by the PWM incorporated for the switches. In recent years the carrier and reference modification based research is going on the inverter field. This paper suggests that the alteration of carriers and references of the three phase voltage source inverter enhance the ability to decrease the harmonic content.This enhanced realization deals with the carrier and reference modification arrangement for three phase voltage source inverter through amalgamating the boosted reference and random triangular carrier. The boosted reference is the addition of sine reference with injection of 1/3rd of reference amplitude (3fs) in the middle portion of the reference wave. i.e., Pi/3 to 2 Pi/3 and 4 Pi/3 to 5 Pi/3. The proposed PWM scheme use two carriers, one is Triangle wave and another one is inverted Triangle wave. The process of selecting the winning carrier among the two triangle carriers is purely based on the LFSR technique. The spectral quality of the induction motor drives has improved by the random carriers. The simulation and experimental values are proving the validity of the PWM method. The PWMs are generated by using parallel processing enabled FPGA processor.

AB For the study of corporate social responsibility, the most fundamental problem is the relationship between Social Responsibility and Financial Performance on enterprises, which is related to whether the enterprise should bear social responsibility directly. For a long time, state-owned enterprises of China as the backbone of social responsibility, to shoulder a large number of policy burden. When corporates' social responsibility rises to the height of the national strategic development level and becomes the focus of government attention, what is the impact of state-owned enterprise social responsibility on financial performance? Will the impact of social responsibility on financial performance in our country be different between private enterprises and state-owned enterprises? This article attempts to study these issues. The study shows that the social responsibility of Chinese enterprises has reduced its financial performance significantly. The more concerned on different aspects of social responsibility, the lower the financial performance. Secondly, compared with the private enterprises, the social responsibility of the state-owned enterprises will reduce its Financial performance, and especially in the areas where government intervention more.

AB Physical education (P.E.) and physical activity are the central and practicable aspects of emotional, mental, and physical well-being. They are crucial determinants of health outcomes within an individuals' lifespan. P.E. has long-established been the elementary role played by schools in promoting physical activity, which in turn has brought with its numerous benefits as far as health is concerned. Various study approaches have been put in place. These approaches assist in reviewing the status of physical education and physical activity in college institutions. The review process helps solely in examining both their short-term and long-term benefits and effects. Merely introducing physical education facet in colleges and forming review committees will not aid in implementing this curriculum, and appropriate teaching frameworks should be delineated. Proper frameworks set in place will ensure full utilization of physical education methods, which will, in turn, reap more benefits. This study aims to conduct exploratory research on the multiple ways of teaching physical education in higher institutions of learning, in particular, colleges. We will be running a double-blind qualitative case study framework to enumerate the effectiveness of the different strategies of P.E. teaching. Both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected for this study. These data will then be analyzed, after which conclusions will be drawn enumerating the various aspects and how they can be holistically combined to realize effectual benefits.

DE Big-data; higher education management; influence; countermeasure
AB Nowadays, China has got into the era of big-data. In the background of big-data information era, the management of college students in China has undergone certain changes, and the trend of student management informationization is obvious. Universities are momentous places for cultivating talents. The student management work of universities directly affects the quality of talent training and affects the stability of colleges and universities (CAU). The internal structure and external environment faced by higher education are undergoing unprecedented profound changes, bringing many new situations, new problems and new challenges to the supervision of university students. Therefore, college education managers need to show solicitude for the impact of big-data technology on college education management (CEM) and propose corresponding countermeasures to raise the productivity of college education administration. This paper concentrates on the characteristics of big-data. On the basis of investigating the present situation and matters of the development of big-data education administration in CAU in China, this paper explores the countermeasures to raise the innovation of big-data education management (BDEM) in universities in China.

AB Various modern learning modes also promote the wide application of online learning. In order to solve the current situation of lack of educational resources in Colleges and universities (CAU), we need to use innovative learning theory, cutting-edge teaching technology and tools, and integrate multimedia education into the existing mixed teaching to form a new teaching mode. This paper takes the teaching course of practical writing as the research object, uses the method of literature survey to read and analyze a large number of relevant literatures. According to the research needs, through the research and summary of the literature content, some views, methods and relevant opinions are collected. In this paper, a questionnaire survey was conducted on 120 students and 10 teachers who participated in the reform of teaching methods. The data collected from the questionnaire were summarized and analyzed by using the statistical method of several cases and logical analysis method. The survey results show that the satisfaction of students in the teaching class with multi-media education integrated into the hybrid university teaching mode reaches 80%, while that of the traditional teaching method class is only 33.33%; 39 students in the new teaching mode achieve excellent results in the assessment, and 19 students in the traditional teaching mode class achieve excellent results. Clear teaching strategy, scientific teaching mode and reasonable teaching content can enhance students' interest in writing course, strengthen students' practical application ability, and play a positive role in the exploration of practical writing teaching mode, and provide certain basis.

DT Article; Early Access
DE College students; optimism; reliability; validity
AB Objective
   To explore the structure of college students' optimism and develop a questionnaire.
   Methods
   The initial items of the questionnaire are formed by interview, open questionnaire and document retrieval. On the basis of forecast, 692 valid questionnaires are obtained from the subjects with the self-designed questionnaire. The life orientation questionnaire is used to test the validity of the criterion.
   Results
   The questionnaire on college students' optimism contains 13 items, including two high-order factors: optimism and pessimism. Optimism includes optimistic expectation and optimistic explanatory style which pessimism factor includes pessimistic expectation and pessimistic explanatory style. The fitting indicators are better (X2/df = 3.45, GFI = 0.96, IFI = 0.95, NNFI = 0.93, CFI = 0.95 and RMSEA = 0.06), internal consistency reliability is between 0.61 and 0.74, and all sub-dimensions of the questionnaire are significantly correlated. The total scores of the questionnaire and four factors are positively correlated with the total scores of the life orientation questionnaire (0.74 similar to 0.81).
   Conclusion
   The college students' optimism is composed of four factors; the reliability and validity meet the requirements of psychometrics, and can be used in related research and practice. This study seemed to show that the CSOQ was a valid tool for measuring optimism among Chinese college students.

AB This paper presents a magnetically controlled series compensation-fault current limiter (MCSC-FCL) which is composed of a magnetically controlled reactor (MCR) and a compensation capacitor. The device is improved from the traditional thyristor-controlled series compensation (TCSC), which has the characteristics of small output harmonics and simple control. The traditional saturated iron-core reactor is improved to increase the adjustable range of output reactance. During the fault, the MCR is connected to the grid alone to limit fault current; when the grid is normal, MCR and capacitor are used in series compensation mode. It effectively improves the utilization rate of the traditional current limiter MCR. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed MCSC-FCL, this paper analyzes the control characteristics of reactor models with different air gap structures by JMAG finite element analysis software, and verifies the voltage regulation characteristics and fault current limitation capabilities on MATLAB/Simulink platform.

AB The article presents the possibility of conducting remote laboratory classes in subjects that require the use of specialized equipment (which the student does not have at home). The article is based on the example of classes in microcontrollers programming and electronic circuits. The methods with the use of simulation programs and an innovative approach enabling work on real equipment are presented. The solutions presented in the article were practically and successfully implemented in connection with the coronavirus pandemic in spring 2020 at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of West Pomeranian University of Technology in Szczecin. A very important feature of the presented ideas is the possibility to adapt the already existing stationary solutions to remote work and use free applications. The characteristic feature of the presented ideas is also simplicity. These two features make it possible to implement remote learning quickly and at a low-cost. Classes conducted using the described system for a group of about 50 students were positively evaluated by them. Their opinions were also included in the article.

AB The use of computer technology for three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction is one of the important development directions of social production. The purpose is to find a new method that can be used in traditional handicraft design, and to explore the application of 3 D reconstruction technology in it. Based on the description and analysis of 3 D reconstruction technology, the 3 D reconstruction algorithm based on Poisson equation is analyzed, and the key steps and problems of the method are clarified. Then, by introducing the shielding design constraint, a 3 D reconstruction algorithm based on shielded Poisson equation is proposed. Finally, the performance of two algorithms is compared by reconstructing the 3 D image of rabbit. The results show that: when the depth value of the algorithm is 11, the surface of the rabbit image obtained by the proposed optimization algorithm is smoother, and the details are more delicate and fluent; under different depth values, with the increase of the depth value, the number of vertices and faces of the two algorithms increase, and the optimal depth values of 3 D reconstruction are more than 8. However, the proposed optimization algorithm has more vertices, and performs better in the reconstruction process; the larger the depth value is, the more time and memory are consumed in 3 D reconstruction, so it is necessary to select the appropriate depth value; the shielding parameters of the algorithm have a great impact on the fineness of the reconstruction model. The larger the parameter is, the higher the fineness is. In a word, the proposed 3 D reconstruction algorithm based on shielded Poisson equation has better practicability and superiority.

AB With the development of the new curriculum reform in China, the traditional college English teaching model is no longer suitable for the needs of college English teaching tasks in the new era. The multimodal literacy teaching in the college English multimodal teaching mode is to help students internalize their English language skills after learning and understanding English knowledge, thus improving the efficiency of English learning. The hot spots and topics in the information age are always inseparable from technological innovation. Wearable technology is becoming more and more popular, the scope of research is expanding, and innovations are constantly emerging, showing interdisciplinary and integrated features. This paper introduces the wearable technology in detail, and takes the college English teaching as an opportunity. Through the questionnaire survey of teachers and students, this paper analyzes the survey data. The results of the survey show that wearable technology can stimulate academic interest in college English. This research attempts to conduct interdisciplinary research on multi-modal semiotics and humanistic teaching methods in the following areas, which expands the scope of research and, to a certain extent, enhances the vitality of multi-modal discourse analysis.

DE Cross-cultural perspective; English teaching; cultural teaching;
   teaching practice research
AB The progress of science and technology and the development of information technology have accelerated the speed of information dissemination and cultural transformation. In the context of multiculturalism, if we want to cultivate talents who can communicate across cultures, domestic English teaching needs further reforms. The unified implementation of English teaching in China has lasted for decades, and the research on teaching theory has gradually formed a stable framework. But from an overall point of view, instillation teaching under test-oriented education is not conducive to improving students' English practice level. In order to solve this problem, this article analyzes the cultural teaching content in college English teaching from a cross-cultural perspective, and emphasizes the importance of cultural infiltration in English teaching. At the same time, it analyzes the problems in teaching practice from multiple aspects of listening, speaking, reading, writing and translation, and puts forward suggestions for the construction of a cross-cultural communication ability training system. Experiments show that in the classes taught by ordinary English teachers, the average proportion of classroom culture teaching is only 14.995%; under the same conditions, the average proportion of classroom culture teaching in the classes taught by foreign teachers reaches 33.865%. Combined with the higher average scores of students in foreign teachers' classes, it can be known that cultural teaching can play a certain role in improving the level of comprehensive English teaching.

DE Network language; socialization; youngsters; emotion engineering; values
   and education
AB Sang language is an important manifestation of Sang subculture which refers to a cultural trend formed by a large scale of young people born in the 90s and 00s expressing or showing their frustration in various forms on social platforms. In recent years, Sang subculture has evolved from a form of network subculture that initially aroused the inner resonance and self-deprecation of middle school and college students, and has developed into a complete industrial chain formed under the combined effect of the deliberate catering of online media and the active marketing of businesses. Its existence eventually caused the mainstream ideology to be impacted, and the ideals, beliefs and value choices of some students were greatly affected. This article takes Sang language as an anchor, pays attention to the thought changes and behavior characteristics of middle school and college students, as well as the channels and methods of Sang language and subculture communication, and then deeply analyzes its motivation. This article finds that Sang language, due to its inherent unique form of mimicry, reflects the emotional and rational characteristics of youth groups in the process of socialization. In the end, it shows that the timely transformation of mainstream cultural discourse on the Internet, guiding the youth student groups to cultivate and practice positive values, and accurately locating life development goals, should become an important task for school youth cultivation.

AB GIS is widely used in the fields of high voltage, ultra-high voltage and ultra-high voltage. The structure of GIS is compact, the floor area is small, the configuration is flexible and the reliability is high. Moreover, it has strong security and strong environmental adaptability. However, the electric field strength in GIS is very strong, once there are some defects in the equipment, partial discharge will occur, resulting in insulation deterioration of GIS equipment. In this paper, positioning detection technology is used, A fast live detection method of power equipment in complex area based on lilac is proposed. The position of the discharge source is roughly located, and then the linear electron accelerator is used to accurately locate the partial discharge source, which improves the efficiency of defect location. Based on the linear electron accelerator, GIS signal detection device is studied. In the detection, it is necessary to obtain the data generated by partial discharge signal, high-frequency current data and data for comparative analysis, so as to effectively eliminate the interference signal in GIS field, and improve the accuracy and defect type identification.

DE Roche multiway tree clustering; comprehensive English; correlation;
   multivariate evaluation
AB In this study, the questionnaire survey, diversified classroom teaching, and multivariate evaluation are carried out on college students of non-English majors based on the Roche multiway tree clustering method. The SPSS statistical software is used for statistical analysis. The results show that Roche multiway tree cluster distribution of non-English major college students is at a medium level. There is no significant correlation between the comprehensive English performance and the overall Roche multiway tree clustering, and there is a low positive correlation between Roche multiway tree clustering and English listening. Studies have suggested that in comprehensive English classroom teaching, teachers should pay attention to the weak intelligence of students, teach students according to their intelligence difference, build a diversified classroom teaching evaluation model, and promote the all-round development of student intelligence.

ID TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE; UNIVERSITY-STUDENTS; INTENTION; MODEL; PLS
AB Under the circumstance of COVID-19, online education has become an inevitable choice and a mainstream form of education in various countries. Intelligent Tutoring Systems ( ITSs ) are a critical category of a carrier of online education which refers to using Artificial Intelligence Technology ( AIT ) to realize distance teaching and learning through integrating multiple resources, assist teachers to implement online classes and help students learn courses online, etc. The target of this study is to examine the determinants that explain college students' adoption of ITSs based on TRA and TAM under the era of COVID-19 in China.. This study targets college students who have used ITSs over the previous year to learn courses. In total, 590 valid samples were collected. Partial least squares ( PLS ) approach is employed to inspect the determinants of college students' acceptance of using ITSs. The results of the analysis indicate that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, subjective norm, college students' attitude and political influence significantly affect college students' behavioral intention towards using ITSs. In addition, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and political influence also affect college students' attitude toward using ITSs. And consisitent with previous research, perceived ease of use has a significant effects on perceived usefulness. This study enriches the TRA and TAM theories by incorporating a new variable political influence for researchers to consider in the future. In addition, it makes several suggestions for system developers to improve system functions regarding its ease of use and for content manufactures to pay attention to quality regarding usefulness. Recommendations are provided to colleges, universities and education authorities to rethink their roles in reforming online education through ITSs.

AB In this paper, a high-efficiency and compact wireless power transfer (WPT) receiving antenna using an flexible printed circuits board (FPCB) with high-Q factor is proposed. The proposed high-efficiency and compact WPT receiving antenna consists of a spiral structure, a lumped element and via through the ground structure. In this paper, in order to design a miniaturized high-efficiency WPT receiving antenna, machine learning technology was used to optimally design the antenna pattern that affects the Q factor. The designed receiving antenna has improved wireless power transmission efficiency with high Q characteristics. The power transfer efficiency is above 88% from distance 10 mm and the resonant frequency is 110 MHz. The sizes of the receiving antenna and the NFC antenna are 30 x 40 mm and 20 x 30 mm, respectively. Machine learning was used to design and fabricate the composite module of a WPT receiving antenna and NFC antenna. Comparison of the experimental results of the proposed receiving antenna with a general receiving antenna confirms the improvement in transmission efficiency.

AB This paper will analyze by analogy, the internal relationship between different design majors is clarified on the basis of discussing the characteristics of design disciplines, and then the talent cultivation direction of design education is discussed. From the point of view of the characteristics of design as a subject, the discipline of design is comprehensive and application-oriented. It is comprehensive as it involves different types of disciplines such as technical skills, abstract concepts and theoretical knowledge, and different types of knowledge such as knowledge about practical skills, human thinking and information, as well as different types of capabilities such as professional skills, creative thinking, knowledge acquisition and application. The knowledge structure of the design subject consists of three dimensions, the thinking level, knowledge level and technical level. The inherent connections of the different branches of the design discipline are as follows: they are interconnected on the thinking level, related on the knowledge level and different on the skill level. The knowledge and abilities on these three dimensions compose the design skills designers should acquire, among which the thinking level serves as the foundational and core piece. Therefore, the design education reform should focus on cultivating students' abilities, especially students' thinking skills. Then, it can be concluded that design education should not emphasize the difference of design direction, but should pay attention to the training of students' design ability instead of the training of students' skills, especially the training of students' thinking ability.

TI A novel understanding of circular four-coil configuration for uniform
   magnetic field generation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION
LA English

DE Uniform magnetic field; sensor; coil; electromagnet; engineering
AB The uniform magnetic field is widely used in sensors and other laboratory devices. The four-coil configuration has the advantage of open space and good uniformity. Traditional schemes include Lee-Whiting, Tetracoil, Braunbeck, etc. The first two schemes have rounding errors of coil turns. The Braunbeck configuration avoids rounding errors, but the structure is solidified and cannot meet the requirements of flexible sensors. In this study, we derive a general constraint equation that fits various four-coil configurations and show that the constraint parameter uniquely defines the configuration. Moreover, we develop a simple optimization approach that allows building the optimized configuration that lacks rounding errors of coil turns. We analyzed system performance for different coil cross sections and configurations. The comparison of the original Lee-Whiting and optimized coils revealed that the normalized maximum radius R-max increased by 7.67%. Finally, the increase in cross-section resulted in performance that was principally different from classical models. The proposed approach makes both scientific and educational contributions for future studies.

AB Nowadays, legal education has received more and more attention from the society. This article takes legal education and teaching as the research object, and uses a literature survey method to read and analyze a lot of related documents. According to research needs, through the research and summary of the content of the literature, the views, thoughts, methods and relevant opinions on the reform of law teaching have been collected. This article uses a questionnaire survey to conduct a sample survey of 300 students and 28 teachers, and grasp their opinions and suggestions on the reform of law teaching. At the same time, comprehensive reforms have been made to the subject setting, teaching strategy, teaching effect and performance evaluation. The results of the study showed that the satisfaction rate of the students before the reform was 77.03%, which was significantly lower than the 95.76% after the reform (P < 0.05). After the reform, the total reasonable rate of teaching strategies was 99.08% (P < 0.05), and the satisfaction of teaching management before the reform was 73.50%, which was lower than the 97.60% after the reform (P < 0.05). The teaching strategy was obvious, and the teaching subjects were complete. And reasonable teaching content plays a vital role in the reform of the law major of our school, and provides a foundation for the reform of law major.

AB The purpose of this study is to study in depth the effective mechanism of China's vocational education reform to promote the poverty alleviation of precision industries. The purpose of this research is to deeply study the effective mechanism of my country's vocational education reform to promote precision industry poverty alleviation, and investigate the financial aid for poor students and the number of aids of a secondary vocational college for 5 consecutive years. Investigate the number of registered poor agricultural households in a city for five consecutive years, the number of rural labor transfers in employment, and the growth of per capita income of farmers. Taking 100 poor families in a poverty-stricken county as an example to investigate and analyze the educational background, knowledge level and attitudes of parents and students to school. Investigate various major local technical trainings conducted in a city for 5 consecutive years. The results show that the poverty subsidy of vocational schools has increased year by year, and the number of poverty subsidies has also increased. Among them, the intensity of targeted poverty alleviation has also been continuously strengthened. The dynamic management of information on the establishment of filing cards has greatly improved the precision of poverty alleviation and realized dynamic management. Per capita income has also achieved steady growth. At the same time, most parents have a junior high school diploma, and the student's academic qualifications are generally not high. In view of the attitude to school, most parents believe that it is very necessary, but the students think that they can not go up. There are more and more people participating in the main technical training in various localities, and more and more training projects are taking place, and the proportion is gradually increasing. These jobs are of great significance to the development of today's society.

DT Article; Early Access
DE TOD; rail transit; mathematical modeling
AB Transit-oriented development zones (TODs) are mixed-use residential or commercial areas that aim to maximize the use of public transportation, and often include functions that encourage public transportation. This paper proposes establishes an equilibrium model for designing the rail transit corridor considering the development of TOD project. The proposed model features the choice of living place. Further, house rent, travel cost and the capacity constraints of TOD's housing supply were also considered in this model. The objective function of model optimization is to maximize profit and maximize social welfare. Results show that while TOD near the CBD station can significantly improve the revenue of rail operation, while TOD far away from the CBD station may increase land use profit due to low land price.

ID TECHNOLOGY; GLOBALIZATION; POLICY
AB In the era of economic globalization, the US and China are the two largest economies in the world and play leading roles in the allocation of global resources. However, under the guidance of the "America First" principle, its economic policies have involved the domestic manufacturing backflow and international trade protectionism, which has led to the rise of "unilateralism" and "local protectionism". These have caused Chinese labor-intensive industries, which leverage the comparative advantages of Chinese economy, to have fallen into development dilemma. From economic comparative advantage perspective, this paper analyzes the importance of labor-intensive industries in Chinese economic transformations, weighs the "dilemmas" and "opportunities" of these industries under the influential trade protection policies, and considers adjusting their factor endowments like personnels and capitals. To matain vitality and promote industrial upgradings, the financial and talents-educational policies of the market and government should seek sustainable strategies to guide this type of industry. The financial support emphasizes on survivals, while talents education focuses on long-term international competence.

AB Machine learning models enable data-based decision-making in many areas and have attracted extensive attention. By testing the factors that influence the adoption of machine learning models, this study expands the scope of machine learning models in information technology adoption research. Based on the machine learning background and Technology Acceptance Model, this study integrates the necessary external variables, proposes a research model, and further verifies the validity of the model through the survey of 192 users of machine learning models. The results showed that organizational factors, trust, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use are positively correlated with the attitude of machine learning models. Moreover, our findings show that the interpretability of the model has an important positive effect on trust. The factors examined in this study are the basis for the development and use of reliable machine learning models. And it has important practical significance for promoting user adoption of machine learning model. Meanwhile, these theoretical studies also provide a strong literature support for the adoption of machine learning models and fill the theoretical research gap in this field.

AB Given that the traditional methods cannot perform clustering analysis on the Internet financial credit reporting directly and effectively, a kind of precise clustering analysis of internet financial credit reporting dependent on multidimensional attribute sparse large data is proposed. By measuring the overall distance between Internet financial credit reporting through the sparse large data with multidimensional attributes, the multidimensional attribute sparse large data are used to perform clustering analysis on the overall distance matrix and the component approximate distance matrix between the data, respectively. The correlation relationship between the Internet financial credit reporting under these two perspectives is taken into comprehensive consideration. Multidimensional attribute sparse large data pairs are used to reflect the comprehensive relationship matrix of the original Internet financial credit reporting to achieve clustering with relatively high quality. Numerical experiments show that compared with the traditional clustering methods, the method proposed in this paper can not only reflect the overall data features effectively, but also improve the clustering effect of the original Internet financial credit reporting data through the analysis of the correlation relationship between the important component attribute sequences.

   capital; AGTFP; threshold model
AB This paper constructs a threshold regression model to empirically test the non-linear relationship between rural human capital and agricultural green total factor productivity (AGTFP) with provincial panel data during 1993-2018. The results show that there is a significant double threshold effect between rural human capital and AGTFP under different levels of agricultural material capital (AF)and agricultural economic development (AGDP). When AF and AGDP are at different levels, the relationship between rural human capital and AGTFP presents an inverse N-type trend or an inverted U-type trend. The nonlinear relationship between rural human capital and AGTFP has been verified. It is necessary to attach importance to the promotion of agricultural human capital to the growth of AGTFP. It is suggested to strengthen education on environmental protection and green production technology training for farmers, and urge them to widely adopt the production mode of mitigating climate warming. In addition, it is important to ensure the coordinated development of AF and rural human capital while enhancing the input of AF.

DE Rhythmic gymnastics ball; sphere; air sports
AB With the application of CFD technology in the field of sports engineering research, there are many research results on ball sports such as football and table tennis, but less research on rhythmic gymnastics equipment for difficult and beautiful sports. This paper uses ADAMS dynamic analysis software to carry out CFD simulation test on ball exercise equipment, and explore the influence of different parameters on the air movement of ball equipment. The results are as follows: (1) the factors that affect the track of rhythmic gymnastics ball in the air are the mass, volume, velocity of the ball, as well as the forces of the ball in the air. (2) The rotation speed of the ball is an important factor affecting the lateral bending degree of the track of rhythmic gymnastics ball. The rotation speed and the air pressure difference between the left and right sides of the ball are directly proportional to the curvature of the running track.(3) The gliding performance of rhythmic gymnastics ball mainly depends on the value of lift drag ratio, which has an important influence on the flight height and flight time of the ball, and its size changes with the attack angle. And there are some suggestions: rhythmic gymnastics ball in the air belongs to non dynamic flight. It is suggested that in practice, the athlete should consider a series of factors, such as the initial velocity of the ball, the throwing angle and the height of the shooting point, so as to effectively control the flight radian, distance and height of the artistic gymnastics ball.

ID MOTIVATION
AB Whether the apprentice is competent for the job and produces performance for the organization is the key index to test the quality of apprenticeship education. Based on competency theory, this paper investigates the influence of competency dimensions and work meaning on performance. Through the competency questionnaire analysis of 224 shop managers in apprentice project enterprises, it is found that: the part of the competency dimension of personality traits, motivation and values hidden in the iceberg model has a significant impact on performance through work meaning; the relationship between work values and work meaning of apprentices is stronger, and that the relationship between work motivation and work meaning of non-apprentices is stronger. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the cultivation of multiple values of apprenticeship, especially the significance of moral education. The results provide reference for upgrading the quality of talent training in Colleges, reconstructing talent training objectives and the practice of human resource management in enterprises.

DE Classroom teaching quality evaluation; triangular fuzzy number
   evaluation; range method; analytic hierarchy process
AB With economic globalization and the informatization of social life, English has become a language extensively used around the globe. The research on the evaluation of English teaching quality is of crucial practical significance and theoretical value. Hence, student evaluation form for the college English classroom teaching quality that has been evaluated and has good reliability is used in this paper to expound the principles of the triangular fuzzy number evaluation method and the range method based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Examples are used to analyze the differences between the two methods as well as their advantages and disadvantages. The comprehensive evaluation result of the teaching quality evaluation of a teacher by using the range method is excellent (85.500 points), and the comprehensive evaluation result by using the triangular fuzzy number method based on the analytic hierarchy process is good (64.818 points). The results show that the range method is better for the comprehensive evaluation of teachers' teaching quality. The statistical analysis results suggest that there are differences between the two methods in the evaluation of the classroom teaching quality in colleges and universities (t = 11.197, P < 0.0001). In the evaluation of the teaching quality by using the triangular fuzzy number evaluation method based on the analytic hierarchy process, the non-linear and fuzzy features of evaluation factors are taken into consideration comprehensively. The weight values of various evaluation indexes are calculated scientifically. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations are combined to obtain the evaluation result of the classroom teaching quality of teachers more objectively, which is of great significance in the practical teaching quality evaluation process.

AB Stock market performance prediction has always been a hit research topic and is attractive due to its strong potential to generate financial profit. Being able to predict future stock price in a relatively accurate way forms a significant task of stock market analysis. Different mechanisms from fundamental analysis to statistical modeling have been deployed to study stock market performance and various factors from fundamental factors, technical factors to market sentiments are also incorporated in the stock price prediction task. However, due to the chaotic stock market performance, which is close to random walk, and the difficulty in discerning influential factors, predicting stock price faces a lot of challenges. In recent years, fast development in fields such as machine learning has offered new ways to look at this task. In this paper, we employ Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm, a recent modification of traditional feedforward neural network with single hidden layer, whose learning speed is greatly improved based on solid mathematical background and capability to circumvent problems such as local minimum is also enhanced, to construct an ELM combination model to study stock market performance and predict stock price. A comparison between the predicted output and the real data is carried out to test the feasibility of applying ELM model to stock market analysis. The result indicates that ELM model is desirable for predicting stock price variation trend while some inaccuracy exists in the prediction of peak values, which may require further model modification. Overall, by applying the machine learning model ELM to predict stock price and generating desirable outcome, this paper both contributes to offering a new way to investigate stock market performance and enlarging the field deployment of ELM model as well.

DE Intangible cultural heritage; economic effect; integrative development
AB In the context of the current economic globalization, the protection of intangible cultural heritage is of great significance to the protection of traditional culture and cultural independence. We suggest that development should be carried out on the basis of the protection of intangible cultural heritage, but the ultimate purpose of the protection of intangible cultural heritage is to promote the protection of intangible cultural heritage through the development of intangible cultural heritage. Intangible cultural heritage needs to be inherited and carried forward, and the development of local tourism needs cultural support. How to integrate the two is worth studying. Taking Huzhou Intangible cultural heritage as an example, this paper studies the complementary and mutually promoting relationship between the creation of intangible cultural heritage brands and the inheritance of intangible cultural heritage, and proposes to rely on the promotion of intangible cultural heritage brands, so as to promote the inheritance and development of intangible cultural heritage.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Education; income level; sports lottery; fixed panel model
AB Sports lottery revenue is not only an important part of the regional and national sports industry, but also a source of public funds to support the continuous enrichment and improvement of public sports resources. It is a major method to promote the participation of the masses in sports activities and consumption, and to improve health. In this paper, panel data of all provinces in China from 2010 to 2019 are collected and empirically tested by the robust standard error estimation method of fixed panel model. The results show that: a) The significant increase of income level in recent years has a significant effect on the sales volume of sports lottery, and the effect is greater in economically underdeveloped areas than in economically developed areas. b) When the income level reaches a certain level, the education level is the most important factor affecting the sales volume of sports lottery. In economically developed regions and provinces with higher per capita income, the economic basis is the guarantee of sports lottery consumption, and the education level is the dominant influencing factor of sports lottery sales.

DE Big data; college English; translation teaching; PACTE translation
   ability model
AB With the development of the big data era and the opening of translation majors in colleges and universities, translation teaching is gradually receiving attention. However, there are still many problems in the training of translators in colleges and universities in terms of teachers, teaching time and teaching mode. In the context of the era of big data, this article uses questionnaires and data analysis, starting from the PACTE translation ability model, combined with constructivist learning theory, blended learning theory, and instructional design theory to analyze the problems of undergraduate translation ability. This article conducts a questionnaire survey on the 2018 students of XX University's a major, and analyzes their English scores. Students' bilingual ability is weak, and it is difficult to consider translation under the influence of context in the translation process; their strategic ability is not ideal, and they lack the ability to solve problems when they encounter specific translation problems. The English performance of the experimental class students who have undergone English translation teaching for one semester is significantly better than the control class students who have not received English translation teaching. Teachers can combine teaching theories to design English translation teaching and cultivate students' awareness of comparative analysis in English learning. Teachers can cultivate students' English thinking ability, promote them to master English better, and help them improve their English application ability.

AB The new curriculum of fine arts is a newly emerging thing in the situation of education reform. There are many facets of traditional art education which should be improved, including the fact that the teacher's classroom teaching is dull, the teaching material is limited, the training mode is single, the "classroom" is understood by the teacher as the normative teaching content instead of a platform for communication, and the teacher can not find his role. In the new curriculum, teachers must change their ideas, so that in the classroom teaching students can take advantage of the teaching materials interestingly and efficiently. Both teachers and students are supposed to find their roles in the new curriculum.

   nursing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Scenario simulation teaching method; progressive teaching mode;
   orthopedic nursing; clinical teaching; application effect
AB Objective
   To investigate the application value of scenario simulation teaching method combined with progressive teaching mode in clinical teaching of orthopedic nursing.
   Methods
   104 nursing interns who were employed in the orthopedics department of our hospital from March 2018 to March 2020 were selected and randomly divided into traditional teaching (TT) group (n = 52) and joint teaching (JT) group (n = 52). Among them, the traditional teaching mode was adopted in the TT group, while the scenario simulation teaching method combined with progressive teaching mode was adopted in the JT group. The theoretical examination results, performance assessment results, comprehensive assessment results, the scores of nurse-patient communication skills, the CTDI-CV (Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory-Chinese Version) scores and the teaching satisfaction in the two groups of nursing interns were compared and analyzed.
   Results
   The theoretical examination results, performance assessment results and comprehensive assessment results in the JT group were significantly better than those in the TT group, with statistical differences (P < 0.05, t = 12.91, t = 11.65, t = 9.92). The scores of nurse-patient communication skills and the CTDI-CV scores in the JT group were significantly better than those in the TT group, with statistical differences (P < 0.05, t = 22.18, t = 16.88). Teaching satisfaction of 94.23% in the JT group was significantly higher than 73.08% in the TT group, with statistical differences (P < 0.05, chi(2) = 11.6050).
   Conclusion
   The application of scenario simulation teaching method combined with progressive teaching mode in clinical teaching of orthopedic nursing can effectively consolidate nursing interns' understanding of theoretical knowledge and significantly improve the proficiency in operating skills, the nurse-patient communication skills, the critical thinking ability in judging patients' conditions and nursing measures, as well as the nursing interns' teaching satisfaction of nursing, which is of positive significance to improve nursing interns' nursing quality.

AB In transmission line, the series compensation is used to improve stability and increases the power transmission capacity. It generates sub synchronous resonance (SSR) at turbine-generator shaft due to the interaction between the series compensation and wind turbine system. To solve this, several methods have been presented. However, these provide less performance during contingency period. Therefore, to mitigate the SSR and also to improve the dynamic performance of hybrid wind and PV system connected with series compensated wind farms, the adaptive technique of the Black Widow Optimization algorithm based Fuzzy Logic Controller (BWO-FLC) with UPFC is proposed in this paper. Here, the objective function is solved optimally using BWO technique. Based on this, the Fuzzy Logic Controller is designed. The results proved that the proposed controller performs the mitigation of SSR. The damping ratios of proposed controller to mitigation of SSR are 0.0098, 0.0139, and 0.0195 for wind speed of 6, 8 and 10 m/s respectively.

TI Study on the occlusion of the visibility window on highway exit ramps

AB Traffic accidents frequently occur at the nose of highway exit ramps for a variety of reasons. When attempting to take an exit, a driver's line of sight may be obscured by the curvature or slope of the main expressway, roadside vegetation, traffic signs, and other vehicles traveling alongside. These increase the likelihood of accidents due to inaccurate or poor driver judgement when approaching a highway exit. Because of emotional responses that accompany the possibility of missing an exit, many drivers act irrationally through haphazard acceleration or braking, aggressive lane changes; in some cases, even coming to a complete stop and reversing against the flow of high speed traffic to correct their course. This study applies to curved highway exit corridors with a poor line of sight. The total visible area of the exit ramp is defined in accordance with the design specifications of both the highway routes and exit ramps, which was then further refined by considering the driving characteristics of both the drivers and of surrounding traffic. This study set out to establish a reliable occlusion model of highway exits with the following goals in mind. Geometric equations describing the area and volume of the target area of the exit ramp are established. Discrete expression equation was deployed to establish the occlusion model for the target area within the visual field. Parameters taken from specifications of the Hunan section of the Shanghai-Kunming Expressway are used for multiple calculations, in which obstruction patterns of objects with the same width, and objects with different width at different positions are analyzed. Based on the patterns observed from stimulated experiments mentioned above, multiple effective measures were proposed to prevent the obstruction of the highway exit ramp. In summary, this study provides theoretical support for prevention of obstruction as well as an anti-occlusion model for better identification of the highway exit ramps by intelligent vehicle systems.

AB Wang Guowei, a famous scholar and thinker in our country, thinks that "aesthetic education harmonizes people's feelings in the process of emotional music education, so as to achieve the perfect domain", "aesthetic education is also emotional education". Therefore, in the process of music education, emotional education plays an important role in middle school music teaching, and it is also the highest and most beautiful realm in the process of music education in music teaching. Music teachers should be good at using appropriate teaching methods and means. In the process of music education, they should lead students into the emotional world, knock on their hearts with the beauty of music, and touch their heartstrings. Only when students' hearts are close to music in the process of music education, can they truly experience the charm of music and realize the true meaning of music in the process of music education. Only in this way can music classes be effectively implemented The purpose of classroom emotion teaching.

AB In order to study the dynamic influence mechanism of population characteristics on health expenses, the panel data of 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government (excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) from 2009 to 2016 were used to construct panel smooth transformation model with population characteristics as heterogeneous variables for empirical analysis. The results show that the population number, population structure and population distribution have significant nonlinear effects on per capita health expenses, and the threshold values of population number, population structure and population distribution are 24.6686 million people, 6.9928%, 40.707%. When the threshold is crossed, The effect of population size on per capita health costs is reduced smoothly, The effect of population structure and population distribution on per capita health cost changed from inhibition to promotion.Therefore, according to the relationship between current population characteristics and health expenses, all regions should optimize the structure of health expenses expenditure, improve the level of health services, especially expand the scale of education and training of targeted rural medical students, strengthen the education and training of rural doctors, in order to narrow the difference between urban and rural diagnosis and treatment level.

TI Active aerodynamic noise control research for supersonic aircraft cavity

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION
LA English

DE Aerodynamic noise; nonlinear; cavity; turbulence; active control
AB Prediction of aerodynamic noise is the key technology for the internal weapon bay of supersonic aircraft. Nonlinear numerical simulation is proposed as a new method to analyze noise recently. The Non-Linear Acoustic Solver (NLAS) is employed to study the cavity noise in supersonic combined with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation. It is shown by the comparison between the calculated results and the WICS wind tunnel tests when the Mach number is 2, the sound pressure level of every monitoring point is in good agreement with experiments. It indicates that the NLAS method which is based on turbulence reconstruction could well simulate the cavity noise in supersonic and reduce mesh numbers. Based on this, the contribution to aerodynamic noise suppression made by active control measure such as adding jet screen at the leading edge of cavity is investigated. It is found that jet screen improves flow condition and increases cavity safety, therefore, it is suitable for suppression of aerodynamic noise under supersonic condition.

DE Basketball; college basketball management system; college sports
AB Research has shown that the world's population is currently 7.8 billion, out of which 28% are exposed to the online market. Creating a sports management system for basketball teams will thus have a great impact to the approximately 2.2 billion people using the online platforms. Since marketing is important in almost every field, we will be employing it in school sports. School sports assume a significant role in mental and physiological well-being, particularly in the information age. Its emergence has incredibly helped in the upkeep of a healthy well being and an exponential decrease in non-communicable diseases and chronic illnesses. As one of the sports being played in college institutions, Basketball is fundamental in maintaining an optimal body mass index (BMI) and reducing obesity. It should thus be encouraged. This study's objective is to oversee the creation of a sports marketing management system (SMMS) for college basketball teams. We explain the procedural processes involved in building the management system. This is because its mere presence and practice are not sufficient to oversee its full potential, marketing is at the core of every successful implementation and it is thus necessary to create this system for this sole purpose. Creating this system, especially in this data age is so important since there are a barrage of platforms to facilitate its use. A previous study has indicated a rise in the utilization of technological gadgets, such as PCs, cell phones, and work stations. Figure 1 indicates these findings. Making a management system that may be utilized with these gadgets will subsequently help access to numerous understudies. It will likewise assist in reaching a large circle of target audience. This is because participants will be not only able to participate on-site but also off-site. This investigation discretely explains the requirement for the SMMS. It procedurally clarifies the procedures required from the conceptualization to its realization and release.

AB The need to evolve an innovative approach that can improve the practical learning outcomes among technical college students necessitated this study. Thus, the present study investigated the effect of innovative pedagogy integration in electrical installation and maintenance works in technical colleges in Enugu and Lagos states of Nigeria. The study adopted a school-based randomised Solomon Four-Group Design involving a treatment group versus the control group. We selected three hundred and fifteen (315) technical college year two (TC II) electrical installation and maintenance work students who met the study's inclusion criteria from the technical colleges in Enugu and Lagos state of Nigeria. The intervention consisted of eight weeks of innovative pedagogy treatment. Electrical installation and Maintenance Achievement Test (EMAT) were used for data collection. We used analysis of variance, t-test for independent samples, and Chi-Squared for data analysis. The outcome indicated that innovative pedagogy improved students' learning outcomes and significantly affected students' EMAT achievement among electrical installation and maintenance work students in the treatment group compared to their control group counterparts. The study showed, no significant main difference across all the control variables. Finally, there is no interaction effect of pre-test and treatment conditions. Thus, the current study suggests that technical college teachers should adopt innovative teaching approaches to improve students' learning outcomes, mainly because access to teaching and learning resources is limited.

AB Analyzing and learning students' behavior states in classroom plays a positive role in understanding and improving the teaching effectiveness. Meanwhile, the application of lightweight network to pattern recognition has become a trend with the development of mobile networks. In order to improve the recognition accuracy of the lightweight network model MobileNetV2 and reduce the computational cost and delay caused by extracting rich features, an improved lightweight network model based on MobileNetV2 is proposed, in which an improved reverse residual module (C-Inverted residual block) is applied to replace the traditional module. In the improved reverse residual module, channel split operation is added to reduce MAC, and channel shuffle operations are used to promote information exchange and channel fusion. Experiments were carried out on Pascal VOC 2007 detection data set to test the general performance of the proposed improved model. Under the operation limits of 140 MFLOPS, 40 MFLOPS and 20 MFLOPS, mean average precision (mAP) of the improved MobileNetV2 algorithm increased by 1.2%, 2.2% and 4.3% compared with MobileNetV2. While the recognition accuracy of the proposed network model on self-made dataset of student classroom behavior states is 4.6% and 3.7% higher than that of MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2 respectively, and the average recognition rate of students' classroom behavior states can be up to 92.7%. The results of this research combined with mobile networks would be expected to be used to evaluate teaching and learning effects and promote teaching quality improvement.

AB Game teaching in physical education has become an effective means to develop students' intelligence, physical strength and basic activity ability in all stages. The quality of game teaching is related to the quality of physical education, which can not be compared with the simple standardized and traditional teaching. With the growth of students' age, it is very necessary to carry out the game teaching in a targeted way. Up to now, the reform of physical education curriculum has been deepened, and the organizational form and goal of physical education teaching have changed dramatically. Games are the same sports activities that students like very much. They are rich in content and various in forms. Most of the games have story plots or competition factors, and integrate various activities such as running, jumping and throwing, which is very suitable for the age characteristics and psychological characteristics of students at all stages.

AB The socialization of old residential district management is an inevitable trend of urban development, but the current situation is not optimistic. According to the theory of community conflict, this paper analyzes obstacles of management socialization from four perspectives of environmental factors, opposite relations, power factors and emotional factors, and constructs an analysis system for the socialization obstacles of old residential district management. Regression analysis of the survey data through the establishment of orderly multiple Logit models, using IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 software to process the data. The regression analysis of the data shows that environmental factors, opposite relations, and emotional factors have a significant impact on the socialization of old residential district management. The results show that the transformation of old residential areas, diversified management of property service enterprises, increased publicity and establishment of supervision mechanisms, and the establishment and use of the role of owners' committees, which can effectively promote the socialization process of old residential district management, fill in shortcomings, and improve the quality of life of residents in old communities.

AB The paper presents an intelligent approach for the comparison of social networks through a cone model by using the fuzzy k-medoids clustering method. It makes use of a geometrical three-dimensional conical model, which astutely represents the user experience views. It uses both the static as well as the dynamic parameters of social networks. In this, we propose an algorithm that investigates which social network is more fruitful. For the experimental results, the proposed work is employed on the data collected from students from different universities through the Google forms, where students are required to rate their experience of using different social networks on different scales.

TI Flow entry conflict detection and resolution scheme for software-defined

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION

DE Software-defined networking; OpenFlow; flow entry conflict; B plus tree
AB Software-defined networking (SDN) has the ability to flexibly configure the network and is widely used in various scenarios. In SDN, different applications require the controller to deploy corresponding flow entries to maintain the effectiveness of network. However, the matching field range covered by entries of different applications may overlap, and when actions specified by these overlapping entries are inconsistent, conflicts may occur. Such conflicts may cause the flow to match the wrong entry, thereby affecting the correct expression of application functions. The scheme we proposed in this paper will be able to detect and resolve conflicts between flow entries. Firstly, we discussed the causes of conflicts, and then classified various conflict situations. This classification will help us to adopt different ways of resolving different types of conflicts and make the resolution of conflicts more targeted. Next, we propose a conflict detection algorithm based on B+ tree. This algorithm can detect different types of conflicts. According to theoretical proof, the use of B+ tree compared with other similar structures better in the performance of the time and space complexity. Finally, for the detected conflicting entries, we propose a conflict resolution scheme based on the failure degree of the flow entry according to the characteristics of SDN services tending to be more detailed. Through experimental evaluation, our scheme can effectively detect and resolve conflicts with lower overhead.

AB To study the influence of comprehensive nursing on self-care ability and psychological state of sufferers with coronary heart disease (CHD) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). From August 2017 to June 2019, 79 patients who underwent coronary intervention in the Department of Cardiology medical of our hospital were selected as the research object. 34 subjects who received routine basic nursing were included in the control group (CG). 45 cases in the observation group (OG) received comprehensive nursing intervention based on routine nursing. The self-care ability, quality of life and psychological state of patients were compared in both groups before and after nursing intervention. The compliance behavior and nursing satisfaction of patients were compared in both groups. After the nursing, the ESCA and life quality scores in both groups were obviously ameliorated compared with those before the nursing care, and the OG was higher than the CG (P < 0.05). After the intervention, the blood pressure, blood lipid, SAS score and SDS score of sufferers were significantly declined in both groups, and the SAS and SDS scores of sufferers in OG were obviously lower than those in CG (p < 0.05). Comprehensive nursing intervention can effectually ameliorate the self-care ability and life quality in sufferers with CHD after PCI, which can be applied and popularized in clinical practice.

AB It is of great value to strengthen the comparative study of value in film English teaching. This reflects that "value education" is the core of quality education. The core of intercultural communication is "value distribution," and "value identity" is identity. The main aspects of learning linguistics. From the perspective of film culture, it is necessary to reduce the "Chinese and English value" of English film education. Among these representative forces, film culture is mainly concentrated in the core of Chinese and English. On the radio, "British film culture" became English. The field of knowledge teaching is much larger. Based on the positive and positive English movies, this paper adopts the teaching method of Chinese and English double subtitle music to capture the words and sentences in the film, and uses the combination of image and sound to improve the perception of English. The difference between Chinese application and English application lies in the embodiment of traditional thinking mode in different countries. It is proved by experiments that there are great differences in application value. However, due to the iconicity and randomness of language symbols, the application of Chinese has some value in English. Students who adopt English film teaching method have advantages in shaping values and accepting foreign values. With the passage of time, the application of English film teaching will continue to deepen.

AB The way the teachers deliver the content of any course curriculum is always important. It must create enough interest in the students, especially, when it is in the online mode. In this paper, a novel pedagogy has been proposed, which can work for both online and offline classes based on the social constructivist methods. The methods followed in the proposed pedagogy are classified into two types, viz. social examples and technical drama. One of the courses of first-year engineering undergraduates, Basic Electrical Engineering (BEE), has been taken into consideration for the practical implementation of this pedagogy. A detailed explanation of the above mentioned two methods has been presented in this paper as teaching experiments (TE), with the support of different topics of the course considered. The teachers of the courses such as BEE can follow the methods described in this paper to facilitate active learning, leading to a good understanding of the concepts. The methods have been designed such as to make both teachers and students active participants in the process of teaching and learning in both online and offline classrooms. Students are well satisfied with this novel pedagogy and it is reflected in their feedback on teacher practices as well as in their performance in the semester examinations.

AB This document presents the development of a didactic software tool used as a platform for the generation of complex urban scenarios based on probabilistic user-defined parameters. An adaptive algorithm and a set of primitive elements have been developed in order to allow the user to define the complexity and main features of the scenario and obtain a script containing the geometric elements that conform the resulting geometry. This tool has been developed by undergraduate students and is the result of a number of multidisciplinary projects. It is used in undergraduate and graduate teaching programs in order to perform multipath ray tracing analyses, validate propagation models, analyze the multipath channel characteristics or study the performance of MIMO antennas, among others.

AB There is a deep relationship between urban design and public health, and the urban built environment plays an important role in shaping human health and well-being. Globally, under the influence of the COVID-19, the interdisciplinary research between the two disciplines has once again attracted attention. From the perspective of public health, the origin of the relationship between the disease and urban design was traced, and the urban epidemic prevention in the "isolation-quarantine-epidemic prevention-traceability" epidemic was discovered response to the changing process. In response to frequent epidemics, it is proposed that urban design needs to return to a healthy city model oriented by public health and public health needs. While promoting the layout of urban epidemic prevention, it actively develops coping strategies for interdisciplinary collaborative research, in order to provide new insights and thinking for urban development research.

DE Flash satellite; Morse code; attitude mode design; light energy
   estimation; ground observation
AB The first satellite which can flash Morse code on orbit is introduced in this paper. The design of the system includes light energy estimation, attitude mode design, elevation angle analysis and flash time design. It is a 100 kg satellite with two LED arrays on 547 km. When it flashes, the satellite points to the observation location. The LED rays flash as the rule of Morse code. The satellite was sent to the orbit in Dec 2018 and the test of flash was completed within one month after then. The photo taken by star sensor can compare the apparent magnitude by the gray level. The results of the analysis show that the satellite can achieve 0 apparent magnitude, which is consistent with the design of the system.

AB Nowadays, due to the rapid development of social economy, many rural labors have flowed into more developed cities, resulting in more and more left-behind children(LBC), which is an urgent problem in our country's life. Although there are many researches on LBC, there are few researches on LBC's physical and mental health(PMH).In this regard, this paper studies whether physical education and exercise are very important for improving PMH in LBC, and collects and classifies data on PMH in LBC by referring to the literature. Interviews are used to collect the true thoughts of LBC and to understand PMH. The questionnaire survey was used to investigate the PMH status of LBC, and objectively and comprehensively collected the PMH status data of LBC. Finally, the data obtained are statistically analyzed by the method of several examples. This paper studies the situation of LBC participating in extracurricular sports activities and makes a comparison with non-LBC. The results show that the LBC who take part in more after-school sports training have better PMH, more cheerful personality, more love and compassion, can quickly adapt to a new environment, and are emotionally stable. They can handle things calmly and develop their individual emotions well. In addition, the probability of PMH problems of non-LBC is smaller than that of LBC. Through the research and analysis of sports and PMH of LBC, it is found that sports play a positive role in promoting the PMH of LBC. Therefore, physical education is of great value to promote the healthy development of LBC.

AB The rapid development of a new generation of information technology has caused major changes in teaching and learning methods, promoted the innovation and transformation of education informatization, and promoted the realization of education modernization. Education informatization has gradually become one of the core factors that determine the quality of education. There is a close connection with the regional economy. The western region of my country (mainly including the mountainous areas in the southwest and the arid areas in the northwest) shows regional characteristics such as fragile ecological environment, lagging economic development, and large gaps in infrastructure and public services. Informatization of education is urgently needed to promote regional economic development. By comparing the gross product and educational expenditure of Zhejiang province and Gansu Province, this paper concludes the interdependence and mutual promotion between the development of educational informationization and regional economic development. On this basis, this paper analyzes the necessity of the informationization of education and the coordinated development of regional economy in the ecologically fragile areas of western China. Finally, from five aspects, it puts forward an effective way to promote the development of education informatization and regional economy, aiming at realizing the coordinated development of education informatization and regional economy. Finally improve the social productivity of western region and our country's comprehensive national strength.

DE Reflective practice; Blackboard&#8482; University of Technology
AB Assessment plays a major role in student learning. It needs to be provided on a regular basis and include the aspect of reflective practice to be really effective. The purpose of this article is to highlight the results of how an academic in Electrical Engineering effectively used Blackboard (TM) to foster student engagement and academic success through regular online self-assessments that require reflective practice. A time-lag study is used with a non-experimental descriptive design. A total of 812 first-year engineering students were asked to complete weekly online self-assessments via Blackboard (TM) between 2016 and 2018. Results indicate that students engaged at least three times more with each section of the course content and that their pass rate increased by more than 20% when compared to previous years where no online self-assessments were used. These results tend to suggest that online self-assessments should include multiple attempts with some form of feedback to foster student engagement and academic success.

AB In view of the widespread of group collective organizational deviance and its profound influence on the development of the organization, its causes and formation mechanism have attracted great attention from the academic and practical circles. Drawing on social identity theory, we attempt to explore the influence mechanism of servant leadership on group collective organizational deviance, especially the intermediation of team egoism. In order to test our model, we conducted a survey on 394 subordinates and 102 team leaders from 5 companies in Pearl River Delta, China. It is found that servant leadership can reduce team egoism, team egoism will enhance group collective organizational deviance, and team egoism plays a mediating role in the relationship between servant leadership and group collective organizational deviance. Our work uses social identity theory to build a comprehensive frame work for understanding the antecedents of group collective organizational deviance, thus providing a uniquely generative frame work for further research.

TI The application of sports skill transfer theory in aerobics teaching in
   the information age
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Sports skill; transfer theory; aerobics; teaching; information age;
   curriculum
AB Aerobics has always been an imperative facet in school curricula, right from elementary to higher institutions of learning like colleges and universities. Its importance in physical and mental well-being cannot be overlooked, especially in this information age, where a sizeable subset of the population has adopted a sedentary lifestyle. Unwholesomeness is still evident notwithstanding its introduction and practice in most institutions. This is presumably due to the lack of a better way to utilize its full potential. This calls for better implementation, for which this paper is written. The object of this paper is to look into the application of sport skill transfer theory in teaching aerobics. Skill transfer is a method of propagating a skill from one docket to the other for the sole purpose of process improvement. Sport skill transfer is thus the process of adopting skills used in sports into the aerobics teaching curriculum. The transfer of these skills will transform the teaching curriculum and processes in the course of aerobics lessons. Some skills which the paper will be delving into are; the use of competition as a tool. Fair competition is always known to improve processes to a certain degree. Other than competition vs practice comparisons, the paper also looks into biofeedback for which it elaborates on the importance of employing electromyogram (EMG) in monitoring motor movements; bilateral skill transfer and the use of imagery are also elaborated. It further discusses the dynamics of aerobics and sports, drawing the similarities and differences of the duo and showing the application of the former's skills in teaching the later, especially in this information era.

AB Rotational Inverted Pendulum is a typical nonlinear, unstable and strong coupling system. How to design a control system to restore the equilibrium state quickly and stably is a problem worth studying. High order super twisting sliding mode system has the advantages of traditional sliding mode control system. Super twisting system can elimination control chatter due to the discontinuities of control variable which contain in traditional sliding mode system. The super twisting system is designed. The saturation function replaces the sign function in the super twisting control function to improve the smoothness of the control variable. The simulation shows that this design has excellent precision. Inverted pendulum has smaller movement stroke than traditional super twisting system. Control chatter is also smaller than traditional super twisting system.

AB This paper describes variable speed wind turbine (Types 3 and 4, IEC 61400-27-1) simulations based on an open-source solution to be applied to Bachelor and Master Degrees. It is an attempt to improve the education quality of such sustainable energy by giving an open-source experimental environment for both undergraduate and graduate students. Indeed, among the renewable sources, wind energy is currently becoming essential in most power systems. The simulations include both one-mass and two-mass mechanical models, as well as pitch angle control. A general overview of the structure, control, and operation of the variable speed wind turbine is provided by these easy-to-use interactive virtual experiments. In addition, a comparison between commercial and open-source software packages is described and discussed in detail. Examples and extensive results are also included in the paper. The models are available in Scilab-Xcos file exchange for power system education and researcher communities.

AB Ultrasonic techniques are applied to treat polluted soils because they are efficient, expeditious, inexpensive, and environmentally safe. In this study, the ultrasonic-assisted organic acid removal of cadmium from mining soil was investigated using the following setup: 0.1 mol/L citric and oxalic acid, a 1:20 solid-liquid ratio, and 30 min of ultrasonic-assisted time. A cadmium removal rate of 69.10% was obtained when using organic acids, while it was only 61.82% for removal by oscillation extraction. This implies that the ultrasonic-assisted removal method has beneficial effects on the removal of cadmium via organic acid. Speciation analysis of cadmium in mining soils before and after organic acid removal was performed using the Tessier sequential extraction procedure. The results showed that exchangeable species and those bound to manganese, iron and carbonates were lower after ultrasonic-assisted organic acid removal. This indicates that organic acids can remove most of the removable cadmium from soil in mining areas fast and efficiently.

AB Effective candidates screening is critical for any IT firm as it impacts the future growth and productivity of that firm. Currently majority of these firms follow a manual approach of hiring employees which is more prone to errors and time consuming. Prime purpose of the research is to develop an intelligent predictive model to decide upon candidate's suitability for an applied It based job. A sample size of 13,168 instances with 19 attributes of job seekers data are used for study. An ensemble predictive meta model approach is presented in the research where a stacked KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours) algorithm combined with hard voting approach is employed. The idea is to use a single unified predictive model in place of separate classification models by considering the predicted class with maximum votes against each class label. The proposed approach comprises two functional modules. 'Stacked KNN Learner Module' involves the use of five variants of KNN which include 1-NN, 3-NN, 5-NN, 7-NN and 9-NN. Individual prediction of the job seeker data from these variants of KNN algorithm are input to the 'Hard Voting Ensemble Predictive unit' which eventually aggregates majority of predicted class votes determined for each class label to generate the final output predicted class label on basis of maximum votes. The developed ensemble meta model is successfully implemented using python programming language and its performance evaluation is done using various metrics. The implemented model generated a 96.96% prediction accuracy rate. The specificity, sensitivity and f-score value recorded was 96.36%, 96.06% and 96.26% respectively. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root mean Square Error (RMSE) value observed with our proposed meta model was 0.0048 and 0.0102 respectively. A comparative analysis of the proposed model was done by varying the data sample size and it gave a consistent performance throughout. It was observed that proposed ensemble model gave an impressive 96.96% mean accuracy rate and the overall performance of other variants was consistent. Performance of proposed meta model was also compared with some existing techniques like C.45, CART and K-Means. It outperformed other techniques in terms of accurately predicting the class label of candidates applying for job. This ensemble meta model can be of great help for growing IT firms and assist the organization unit in hiring right and deserving candidates in future. Proposed work can act as a decision making framework in multi sector units with enormous work force to streamline performance appraisal process thereby enabling in hiring right people for right job.

DE Intelligence behavior recognition; multi-scale fusion; spatio-temporal
   GCNs; residual connection
AB In the era of intelligent education, human behavior recognition based on computer vision is an important branch of pattern recognition. Human behavior recognition is a basic technology in the fields of intelligent monitoring and human-computer interaction in education. The dynamic changes of human skeleton provide important information for the recognition of educational behavior. Traditional methods usually use manual information to label or traverse rules only, resulting in limited representation capabilities and poor generalization performance of the model. In this paper, a kind of dynamic skeleton model with residual is adopted-a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network based on residual connections, which not only overcomes the limitations of previous methods, but also can learn the spatio-temporal model from the skeleton data. In the big bone NTU-RGB + D dataset, the network model not only improved the representation ability of human behavior characteristics, but also improved the generalization ability, and achieved better recognition effect than the existing model. In addition, this paper also compares the results of behavior recognition on subsets of different joint points, and finds that spatial structure division have better effects.

AB COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on higher education worldwide. In particular, the situation can be more crucial for electrical power engineering education due to the importance of the direct relationship between the students and their instructor embodied in the campus' classroom interaction and the requisite face-to-face learning. Apparently, e-learning instructional design has provided a fairly accepted solution through online lectures and exams for power engineering courses. Nevertheless, the difficulty persists in moving the experiment equipment of the laboratories to the homes of the students since most experiments were likely to be carried out on the University campus' dedicated power system panels. An urgent and reduced cost solution is therefore needed. This paper introduces a shortcut design method as a compensatory solution at no extra cost, which during this challenging period is suitable for teaching power system labs and also suitable for full online education programs. The work presented in the paper goes beyond that to discuss the relevance to ABET student outcomes. Two experiments are presented in the PowerWorld Simulator environment with systematic steps to facilitate the expansion of the rest of the laboratory experiments. The method is based on the simulation of a textbook example and the verification of results from another textbook followed by a discussion of the relevant students' outcomes of ABET. The paper may be used as an educational guide for instructors in the following academic year in institutions that embrace distance learning programs.

AB Nowadays, there are more and more researches on the application of natural language processing technology in computer-aided language system, which can provide a good assistant role for foreign language learners. However, in the research of computer-aided language system, there are still some deficiencies in the recognition of English spoken stress nodes, which cannot be well recognized. Based on this, this paper proposes a method of English spoken accent recognition based on natural language processing and endpoint detection algorithm, which aims to promote the accuracy of accent recognition in the computer-aided language system and improve the performance of the computer-aided language system. In order to avoid the interference of background noise, this paper proposes a short-term time-frequency endpoint detection algorithm which can accurately judge the beginning and end of speech in complex environment. Then, on the basis of traditional speech feature extraction and fractal dimension theory, a nonlinear fractal dimension speech feature is extracted. Finally, RankNet is used to process the extracted features to realize the recognition of English spoken stress nodes. In the simulation analysis, the application effect of the short-term time-frequency endpoint detection algorithm proposed in this paper in the complex background noise and the effect of non-linear fractal dimension speech features on the recognition of English spoken stress nodes are verified. Finally, the performance and good application effect of the method designed in this paper are illustrated.

AB Interest in facial recognition hypotheses and algorithms has grown steadily over the last few decades. Video monitoring, criminal identification, building access control, and unmanned and autonomous vehicles are only a few examples of concrete applications that are becoming increasingly attractive to industry. Various techniques are being developed, including local, holistic, and hybrid approaches, which use only a few face image characteristics or the entire facial features to provide a face image description. Many methods have good results, if there are sufficiently representative training samples per person, in the face recognition system. Facial part finding and extraction show the utmost vital role in face and age recognition. In this research work a new algorithm is proposed for Face and Age Recognition (FAR) by using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine (RBF-SVM) classifier, and Rotational Local Binary Pattern (RLBP). RLBP is utilized for the selection and extraction of features from the face image. In this algorithm, extract the face component like Nose, Mouth, Left and Right eye. In the preprocessing stage median filter is used to remove noises from the face image. By using this, there is an improvement in the feature extraction procedure. In pattern recognition, a basic errand is finding a picture from the picture parts. For the implementation of results FG-NET ((Face and Gesture Recognition Network) and AT&T datasets are used. The detection rate of face recognition has reached up to 92-98% and the detection rate for age recognition is 87%. The proposed algorithm is compared with SVM shows better over previous algorithms and also estimate the value of accuracy.

DE Ensemble model output statistics; ensemble verification; homogeneous and

AB Ensemble verification of low-level wind shear (LLWS) is an important issue in airplane landing operation and management. However, there have been few studies on the probabilistic forecasts of LLWS obtained from ensemble prediction system. In this study, we analyzed a reliability analysis to verify LLWS ensemble member forecasts and observation based on the limited grid points around Jeju International Airport in Jeju. Homogeneous and non-homogeneous regression models were used to reduce the bias and dispersion existing ensemble prediction system and to provide probabilistic forecast. Prior to applying probabilistic forecast model, reliability analysis was conducted by using rank histogram to identify the statistical consistency of LLWS ensemble forecasts and corresponding observations. Based on the results of our study, we found that LLWS ensemble forecasts had a consistent positive bias, indicating over-forecasting, and were under-dispersed for all seasons. To correct such biases, homogeneous regression and non-homogeneous regressions as EMOS (Ensemble Model Output Statistics) and EMOS exchangeable model by assuming exchangeable ensemble members were applied. The prediction skills of the methods were compared by the mean absolute error and continuous ranked probability score. We found that the prediction skills of probabilistic forecasts of EMOS exchangeable model were superior to the bias-corrected forecasts in terms of deterministic prediction.

   mixed mode database miner; SLIQ
AB Graphical processing unit (GPU) has gained more popularity among researchers in the field of decision making and knowledge discovery systems. However, most of the earlier studies have GPU memory utilization, computational time, and accuracy limitations. The main contribution of this paper is to present a novel algorithm called the Mixed Mode Database Miner (MMDBM) classifier by implementing multithreading concepts on a large number of attributes. The proposed method use the quick sort algorithm in GPU parallel computing to overcome the state of the art limitations. This method applies the dynamic rule generation approach for constructing the decision tree based on the predicted rules. Moreover, the implementation results are compared with both SLIQ and MMDBM using Java and GPU with the computed acceleration ratio time using the BP dataset. The primary objective of this work is to improve the performance with less processing time. The results are also analyzed using various threads in GPU mining using eight different datasets of UCI Machine learning repository. The proposed MMDBM algorithm have been validated on these chosen eight different dataset with accuracy of 91.3% in diabetes, 89.1% in breast cancer, 96.6% in iris, 89.9% in labor, 95.4% in vote, 89.5% in credit card, 78.7% in supermarket and 78.7% in BP, and simultaneously, it also takes less computational time for given datasets. The outcome of this work will be beneficial for the research community to develop more effective multi thread based GPU solution in GPU mining to handle large set of data in minimal processing time. Therefore, this can be considered a more reliable and precise method for GPU computing.

AB Nowadays, with the development of economy, sports industry attracts more and more people's attention, and the number and scale of sports events continue to expand. But the fierce competition, for athletes, is not only physical competition, psychological competition is particularly important. Psychological pressure is an important factor that affects athletes to play at a high level in the competition field. How to analyze the pressure source of athletes in the competition field is very important for athletes to overcome the competition pressure. Therefore, this paper designs a method based on the improved hierarchical K-Means clustering algorithm (KMCA) to analyze the pressure source of athletes in the competition field, so as to help athletes overcome the pressure on the competition field and promote their high-level performance. In this method, firstly, 182 athletes were investigated by questionnaire to obtain the data of related psychological pressure sources. Secondly, because KMCA is sensitive to the selection of initial class center, the performance of KMCA is directly related to the selection of initial class. Aiming at the problem of KMCA, this paper proposes an improved hierarchical KMCA. Finally, the improved hierarchical KMCA is applied to the clustering analysis of sports competition pressure source data. Through simulation analysis, compared with KMCA, the improved layered KMCA proposed in this paper has a good performance improvement. The improved hierarchical KMCA proposed in this paper can be applied to the analysis of the pressure source of athletes in the competition field, which can analyze the pressure of athletes and get the characteristics of the pressure of athletes, so as to help athletes overcome the pressure in the competition field and achieve the mental health of the competition field?

AB To investigate the bond strength between BFRP bars and concrete under freezing and thawing cycles, a total of 36 specimens for freezing and thawing cycles tests and center pull-out tests were carried out with different times of freezing and thawing cycles (0, 10, 20, and 40 times) and different concrete strength grades (C30, C35, and C40). The results of this study showed that the specimens without freezing and thawing cycle (0 times) and specimens of C30 with freeze-thaw for 40 times were pulled out, and the remaining specimens were split. With the increase of the concrete strength grade, the debonding strength increases gradually and the ultimate bond strength does not increase in proportion. The debonding strength of BFRP bars and concrete decreases gradually with the times of freezing and thawing cycles. The ultimate bond strength and peak slip indicated a trend of increasing and then decreasing with the increasing times of freezing and thawing, while the peak slip of specimens of C30 with 40 times freeze-thaw increases slightly.

AB The new crown pneumonia (COVID-19) epidemic in 2020 has spread globally, causing schools around the world to stop routine teaching. Educational institutions in various countries have adopted online teaching methods in response to this crisis. This research, carried out in Human Institute of Information Technology with a number of teachers and students as its subjects, sets out to give statistical analysis upon the students' selections of online teaching platforms as well as their evaluations of online teaching. At the same time, based on the online teaching practice of "Building Structure", a certain quantity of research upon the online teaching practice is completed among the students who began their college studies in engineering cost in the year of 2018. According to all these studies, it is evident that multiple factors such as teachers' ages, professions, and the features of various online teaching platforms, can determine which one is used by different individuals. The evaluation results suggest that online teaching is necessary under the impact of the epidemic despite the fact that students may face a series of problems for lack of self-control and other possible reasons. Through practice, an innovative teaching and evaluation method can partially solve the problems found in online teaching and provide useful ideas for creating higher quality teaching on the Internet.

AB With the rapid development of information technology, multimedia-assisted instruction has been widely used in classroom teaching, especially in English classroom teaching, the importance of multimedia teaching has been generally recognized. However, there are still some problems in the practical application of multimedia teaching, which deserve further study. Taking 400 students and 50 teachers as the subjects of investigation, through my own English classroom teaching practice, observation and investigation, this paper explores and analyses the real situation of multimedia English teaching from many aspects, and reflects on how to improve multimedia English teaching more effectively in the multimedia environment. In English teaching, we should correctly view the position of multimedia in teaching, correctly understand the traditional English teaching relative to multimedia, organically combine multimedia English teaching with traditional English teaching, and pay attention to people-oriented, teacher-student interaction and emotional exchange in multimedia classroom teaching. Finally, according to the survey results, we can know that what is important is not the improvement of teaching methods and equipment but whether the teaching concept is updated.

AB It is a theoretical innovation of teaching concept that the distance English teaching integrates with intelligent learning based on the perspective of big data. The acquisition of distance English teaching data requires the realization of automatic collection, forming the collection of data systematization, standardization, sustainability and real-time. The design mode and storage mode of data resources in the early stage have strict requirements. The analysis of distance English teaching data is to provide guarantee for future intelligent learning, because of the complexity of teaching data, the continuous and changing dynamic data, difficulties in mining the law of change and large volatility affected by individuals. To explore the inherent law and value of distance English teaching data will effectively promote the improvement of learners' learning efficiency, the improvement of the overall level of distance education, the further expansion of educational opportunities and the enhancement of employability, and provide reference value for other related fields. Therefore, it is very important and urgent to study scientific methods which are suitable for distance English intelligent learning from the perspective of big data.

AB With the deepening internationalization of China's economy and society, English has gradually become a common language for Chinese people to connect with the world, and plays an increasingly important role in daily life. At the same time, Chinese people's mastery of English is gradually improving. Grasping the foundation of this period can effectively improve students' English level, and it will play a very important role in further learning English or job hunting in the future. Therefore, how to improve the interest of college school students in English learning and improve their ability and level of English learning is particularly important. Virtual community refers to a group of people who communicate and discuss through the Internet and are willing to share some knowledge and information in the exchange, and gradually develop into a social network aggregation. This paper designs an English learning platform for college school students based on virtual community and image processing technology. The platform is developed with SSM framework. After the development, the platform is tested for college school students in several schools in Xi'an. The experimental results show that the system can effectively stimulate students' interest in learning English, and then improve students' vocabulary and academic performance, which provides an effective reference for the study of students' learning methods.

ID ACHIEVEMENT; POLICY
AB This study aims to identify the epistemological and cultural beliefs that act as barriers in English learning by Saudi undergraduate learners. English is a compulsory component of education from the early school years in Saudi Arabia, and the Ministry of Education invests a great deal of workforce and financial resources in this sector in a concerted effort to ensure that Saudi students attain language proficiency. The study employed a mixed-method research design and was conducted with 85 undergraduate learners at Qassim University. It used a questionnaire and interviews to obtain insight into the factors that inhibit the English learning experience. Results revealed that the respondents' resistance to the learning of others' culture stems mainly from the epistemic and cultural barriers embedded in English language learning. Implications of the study will provide the basis to policymakers, educationists, institutions, and learners for contextualizing the English language curriculum of Saudi Arabia.

AB People's learning style is constantly changing together with the rapid development of information technology. Nowadays, online learning has become a common learning style, but online learning resource providers are also faced with the charging issue. Besides, a large number of studies have been made by scholars at home and abroad in this field. In this paper, the influence of middle school students' self-efficacy on online learning resource purchase intention is analyzed, and the study comprises two stages. To be specific, in the first stage, the interview method is adopted to acquire related materials, and the grounded theory is also followed to reconstruct the theoretical research framework; in the second stage, the theoretical framework is empirically verified by the questionnaire. Then, it is found that middle school students' self-efficacy affects the identity about online learning resources' perceived quality and their purchase intention for online learning resources. At the same time, the teacher-student relation may also reinforce students' purchase intention for online learning resources. Thus, it can be seen that online learning resources' perceived quality and the intimate teacher-student relation have significant influence on middle school students' purchase intention.

DE Conjugate matching cooperative game method; agriculture and animal
   husbandry; industrial structure; optimization model
AB Whether the regional industrial structure reasonably reflects the level of economic development of a region, and a good industrial structure can promote the development of economic cycle. Agricultural production structure is closely related to water resources and grain yield. Optimizing agricultural industrial structure is related to the national economy and people's livelihood, and has a great impact on the economic development of a region. In this paper, an optimization model based on conjugate cooperative game is established to verify the influence on the development of agricultural industrial structure, and propose solutions. The research has good innovation and guidance. In view of the unreasonable regional industrial structure, starting with the fundamental theoretical research of the regional industrial structure adjustment, a conjugate matching cooperative game method is used to establish a regional industrial structure optimization model. The results suggest that: Wheat planting area is increased by 1.1%, maize planting area is decreased by 40.5%, beans planting area is increased by 16.5%, potato planting area is increased by 18.3%, oil crops planting area is decreased by 5.5%, vegetable planting area is increased by 4.2%, and forage planting area is increased by 5.9%. The proportion of food crops: cash crops: forage is adjusted from 50.0: 11.7: 38.3 to 27.1: 28.7: 44.2, and the structure of agriculture and animal husbandry tends to be rationalized. In this paper, the conjugate matching cooperative game method is used to analyze the model, and the optimization method of regional industrial structure is proposed, which can help agricultural industry to improve production and promote the further optimization of industrial structure.

AB Despite Saudi Arabia's substantial investment in English and Science education to enhance future generations' global competitiveness, listening skills challenge many Saudi learners of English as a foreign language (EFL). Most language courses at Saudi universities rely heavily on textbooks and sometimes use limited, non-film-based audio-visual support. This study examined the effects of including English feature films as teaching resources for sophomore English majors (N = 40) at Qassim University in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It evaluated learner perceptions of the introduced methodology and materials. It measured the experiment's success through pretest and posttest to accurately measure EFL learners' listening skills. The results indicated significant improvement and learner engagement through film-based instruction as the literary texts were deemed difficult given their length and the variety of their language use.

AB With the continuous development of the modern university system, the focus of university management continues to move downward, and the improvement of the internal governance structure of universities has become a research hotspot in higher education academic circles. This article aims to improve the governance structure of colleges and universities and improve the governance capacity of colleges and universities by discussing the application of information technology in the governance structure of colleges and universities. This paper conducts questionnaire surveys and interviews with some teachers and students and relevant persons in charge of A colleges and universities, and analyzes the current situation of the governance structure of college A, the existing problems and the current situation of governance informatization of college A. 80.46% of the respondents believe that the actual governance of the school is still dominated by administrative power, and the administrativeization of colleges and universities is becoming more and more serious; 93.71% think that academic strength is weakened; 77.48% think that in participating in school governance matters, teacher and student participation is low and the school does not pay enough attention to it. Based on this, they put forward countermeasures to improve the governance structure of universities. The research in this article is helpful to realize the modernization of my country's university governance and university development through the informationization of university governance.

AB With the gradual advancement of education reform, English learning has become more and more important, and efficient and fast English learning has become a concern of people. In this study, an online translation platform based on artificial intelligence was selected for exploration. Use SQLite software database server as text data source. When the user performs English translation, the query word will be input into the translation platform, and at the same time, the artificial intelligence Google API translation technology will translate the text. Based on the collected actual user service usage records, build edge computing solutions and analyze user data input records. Use word2vec to construct the feature vector of the word, and use LSTM to construct the word ranking of the text. The word ranking method is used to predict the user's service usage, select the corresponding edge server, and combine the relevant probability model to preload the service. Combined with the edge algorithm compression data processing technology of the Internet of Things, the data is synchronized and tracked. After the data is compressed, the translated text is displayed on the application interface in the form of voice and words. The research results show that the use of edge computing of the Internet of Things increases the preservation rate of historical query records of intelligent translation by 30%, and the intelligent translation platform predicts that the matching degree of users' translation queries is 90%. The use of edge algorithm compression technology of the Internet of Things can greatly save the network traffic and bandwidth of the server. The optimized query algorithm can improve query efficiency, save query time, and increase users' enthusiasm for learning English.

DE Trend analysis of financial market; neural network prediction; BP neural
   network; autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity
AB Many experts and scholars at home and abroad have studied this topic in depth, laying a solid foundation for the research of financial market prediction. At present, the mainstream prediction method is to use neural network and autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity to build models, which is a more scientific way, and also verified the feasibility of the way in many studies. In order to improve the accuracy of financial market trend prediction, this paper studies in detail the neural network system represented by BP and the autoregressive conditional heterogeneous variance model represented by GARCH. Analyze its structure and algorithm, combine the advantages of both, create a GARCH-BP model, and transform its combination structure and optimize the algorithm according to the uniqueness of the financial market, so as to meet the market as much as possible Characteristics. The novelty of this paper is the construction of the autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model, which lays the foundation for the prediction of financial market trends through the construction of the model. However, there are some shortcomings in this article. The overall overview of the financial market is not very clear, and the prediction of the BP network is not so comprehensive. Finally, through the actual data statistics of market transactions, the effectiveness of the GARCH-BP model was tested, analyzed and researched. The final results show that model has a good effect on the prediction and trend analysis of market, and its accuracy and availability greatly improved compared with the previous conventional approach, which is worth further study and extensive research It is believed that the financial market prediction model will become one of the mainstream tools in the industry after its later improvement.

   speech recognition; Lattice; SVM
AB Language is the most important communication tool of human beings, and listening is one of the basic skills of language expression. Without good listening comprehension ability, it is impossible to use language flexibly to communicate. Due to the influence of traditional education mode, Chinese students' English listening is generally poor. Therefore, a new English listening teaching mode is needed to help students improve their English listening. In this paper, multimedia network technology is used to realize the integrated English listening teaching of listening, speaking and dictation skills, and a multimedia network English listening teaching model based on speech recognition confidence learning algorithm is proposed. In order to improve the effectiveness of the mainstream confidence method based on Lattice posterior probability, this paper proposes an improved confidence algorithm based on Lattice posterior probability, and then converts the obtained confidence score into discriminant confidence score by Support Vector Machine(SVM) to further enhance the discriminant ability of confidence. Aiming at the imbalance of training data, a score correction strategy is proposed. The experiment shows that the English listening teaching model realized by using multimedia network technology can effectively enhance the students interest in learning and improve their listening ability. And the improvement of the mainstream confidence method based on Lattice posteriori probability can effectively improve the recognition ability of the algorithm and further improve the students' English listening learning effect.

AB The development concept of higher education will have a direct impact on the development direction of higher education, because the concept usually reflects people's understanding of the law of higher education, and the current education concept restricts the scale, quality, structure and efficiency of higher education to a certain extent. Throughout the evolution of the world's higher education development concept, it has generally experienced the overall coordination of the economic growth, the internal and external laws, and the people-centered sustainable development. This paper hopes to provide effective help by joint intelligent algorithms. In this paper, the particle swarm optimization algorithm in intelligent optimization algorithm and the FCM algorithm in cluster analysis are studied in depth, and the two are merged together to propose a fuzzy clustering algorithm based on improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. The main research contents of this thesis include: Firstly, the PSO algorithm is improved, and the random search step levy flights and PSO algorithm are repeatedly called by the iterative mode by introducing the eagle strategy. After improvement, the ESPSO algorithm can achieve a balance between global search and local development, and make the particles have more satisfactory search ability and convergence effect. Then the improved PSO algorithm is integrated into the FCM algorithm to solve the above problems of the FCM clustering algorithm and improve the clustering effect. The experimental results show that the improved espso algorithm and FCM algorithm are suitable for actual data. The simulation results show that the algorithm has better clustering effect than the traditional clustering algorithm.

DE Constructivist theory; multimedia; college English; teaching
AB Constructivist theory advocates a "student-centered" teaching model, focusing on learner-centered and problem-based learning, collaborative inquiry learning, and situational learning. Constructivism plays a huge role in college English teaching, by enabling students to give full play to their initiative and enthusiasm. Simultaneously, the use of multimedia technology provides ideal conditions for constructivism to apply to college English teaching. Building a reasonable application of theory in the classroom English teaching, multimedia helps college teachers to optimize the classroom teaching and improve the English teaching quality. Information technology and network, has been fully utilized in the service of teaching, providing the teachers with new teaching ideas and techniques, and bringing the teaching new vitality. This paper discusses and explores how constructivism directs multimedia-assisted English teaching. Designed under the theory of constructivism, experiments were conducted on 188 sophomore students in teaching the course of college English intensive reading. The results of the experiments show the organic combination of constructivism and multimedia assistance can promote the effectiveness of college English teaching, and greatly improve students' learning ability as well.

AB The paper conducts an investigation on the service of public gymnasiums focusing on public satisfaction degree by collecting and studying the data about the service quality of public gymnasiums according to satisfaction-oriented multidimensional survey. The satisfaction degrees in the multidimensional research mainly include basic satisfaction rate, expectation satisfaction rate, excitement satisfaction rate, undifferentiated satisfaction rate and reverse satisfaction rate, a total of five dimensions. The service quality of public gymnasiums is subdivided based on these five dimensions and the linear superposition method of stacked plot, which refers to the comparative analysis of the changing tendency of common linear superposition and differential linear superposition, is applied to observe the linear superposition tendency in the process of improving the service quality of public gymnasiums, thus obtaining the specific judgement and analysis of the tendency in service quality. In the social construction and public operation of public gymnasiums in China, service capability has been in a tough dilemma and only by grasping the key factor and combining the targeted strategies obtained from the real survey, can the problems in the development of public gymnasiums be solved effectively and public gymnasiums embrace smooth and sustainable development.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Accessibility to primary education resources; multiple constraint model;
   multi-mode transport
AB In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the equity issues in education, Many Chinese families hope to change the fate of their children through educational equity. Based on the theory of accessibility, this paper analyzes the accessibility of distance education resources by using multi constraint model. The primary school education resources in the former Haishu District of Ningbo City are taken as examples to evaluate the accessibility to educational resources in all the primary schools in the district under the walking mode, the public transport mode, and the driving mode, respectively. The study shows that the areas with high accessibility to education resources in Haishu District are mainly distributed in places with developed road networks, large scale schools, and developed public transport networks, while those places with low accessibility are mainly located in the peripheral area. There are significant differences in the accessibility under different modes of transport, and the accessibility in the driving mode is superior to that in the public transport mode and the walking mode. In comparison, the correction effect on the accessibility in the public transport mode and the driving mode is average. Based on the multiple constraint model, the correction effect on the accessibility in the walking mode is significant. According to the analysis results, suggestions are put forward to promote the balanced development of educational resources in the Haishu District.

AB This study aims to identify a range of changes and challenges that education in English (as a foreign language) presents to Saudi university students' mainstream culture. With greater exposure to the internet and foreign media, travel to other countries, and observation of the country's immigrant populations' cultures, the young Saudis are changing their perception of the native culture. Though it is too early to identify the nature and extent of these changes, these are perceptible at least on the educational campuses. Though not very pronounced because of the Saudi culture is very deeply rooted and firm, these changes can be perceived during informal conversation setups. A certain degree of inhibition also laces the young people's views, unsure as they are to the reaction of society to their changed perceptions. It is essential to understand these changing perceptions of the young Saudi people so that the impressions formed by them may be given a positive turn vis-a-vis the rich Saudi heritage and ancient cultural ethos, while at the same time, ensuring that the nation walks in tandem with its compatriots across the globe. This study takes a phenomenological qualitative research approach, seeing the opinions of fifty proficient English students at Qassim University via a self-report survey to gather data on their behaviors and attitudes vis-a-vis learning English and native culture.

AB With the advancement of multimedia technology, a series of problems have emerged in the reform of college English teaching. How to use multimedia to assist college students in English learning has become a meaningful study. Multimedia-assisted instruction is a common method of teaching English. The design of multimedia-assisted English teaching resource software determines its development, management, evaluation and other aspects, so the design of multimedia platform plays a vital role in the effect of multimedia teaching. This paper will discuss the design and implementation of multimedia-assisted college English independent education resources from the perspective of knowledge classification. Through the content analysis, some problems exist in the design process of some college English multimedia teaching, and the status quo is analyzed. It also studies the difficulties of college students in the process of multimedia assisted learning, and how college students hope to design multimedia independent learning multimedia platform. Finally, the five knowledge classification learning theories of "listening, speaking, reading, writing and translating" can change the status quo, meet the needs of college students, and develop the knowledge of vocabulary, grammar and listening in college English. The design strategy of self-learning multimedia-assisted instruction and the design of college English self-learning multimedia teaching is briefly written.

AB To solve the problems of urbanization and homogenization of landscape, loss of regional culture, and lack of overall planning in the landscape planning and design of Chinese villages in the context of urban-rural integration, by combining the Attraction-Validity-Capacity (AVC) theory with the design and planning of rural landscapes, constructing an AVC-based rural landscape evaluation indicator system, and combining Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and other methods, the relationship of rural planning to the vitality, attractiveness, and capacity of AVC theory is explored. Combined with the theory of AVC, the theoretical basis for the expression of regional culture in the planning and construction of rural landscape is put forward. The results show that after the construction of the AVC evaluation system for the special terrain and deep cultural heritage of Dang village in Hancheng City, Shaanxi Province, the comprehensive AVC score of Dang village landscape is 0.3121, and the comprehensive scores of attraction, vitality, and capacity are 0.3055, 0.2985, and 0.3381, respectively. In summary, it is concluded that although Dang village has a good cultural environment and profound background, it lacks reasonable development and orderly planning measures, resulting in the gradual loss of its unique regional culture. Finally, combined with the AVC evaluation and analysis results, suggestions for the follow-up construction planning of Dang village are put forward and applied to practical teaching research. The results can provide a reference for studying the expression of regional culture in landscape planning and design.

AB With the advent of the information age, multimedia technology and Internet technology have shown diverse characteristics. Our lifestyle has undergone fundamental changes in almost every aspect: network-based computers are used in almost every aspect of social daily life. It has become a means of household information exchange; the number of web-based distance education learners exceeds traditional face-to-face teaching. Therefore, processing power is very important for clever computers to search, analyze, synthesize and exchange information online. In addition to reading and writing, this ability is seen as a new electronic literacy. Those who lack it will be considered illiterate in the near future. Since English has gained the status of a global language, about 85% of the world's electronically stored information is in English, how to inject English learners into electronic culture to ensure the survival of every citizen. The digital age has become the basic task of every educator, especially those who teach English. This paper uses questionnaires and interviews to investigate and analyze the adaptability of college students' English autonomous learning from three aspects: learning concept, learning environment and learning style. The survey results show that students are relatively uncomfortable with English autonomous learning in the multimedia network environment, especially for the online learning environment. On this basis, this paper proposes suggestions for improvement of the current teaching model, in order to help college students to carry out independent learning better.

AB Purpose
   To evaluate the effect of midwifery-led doula companion care in puerpera delivery nursing.
   Methods
   126 primiparas were admitted to our hospital from June 2018 to November 2019 by random sampling method. According to the order of admission of primiparas, they were divided into conventional group (63 cases) and study group (63 cases). The routine group of primiparas were given routine delivery care, while the research group of primiparas were given doula accompanied care by midwives. The time of labor, pregnancy outcome, delivery pain score, delivery control and anxiety score of the two groups were compared and analyzed.
   Results
   Compared with the conventional group, the time of the first, second and total labor was significantly shorter in the study group (P < 0.05). The amount of postpartum hemorrhage in the study group was significantly less than that in the conventional group (P < 0.05). The rate of perineal incision and perineal laceration in the study group was significantly lower than that in the conventional group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in Apgar score <8 points compared with the control group (P > 0.05). The scores of pain and anxiety in the second stage of labor were significantly lower in the study group than in the conventional group (P < 0.05). The control score of the puerpera in the study group was significantly higher than that in the conventional group (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion
   The intervention measures of companion doula led by midwives can effectively shorten the time of labor, reduce the anxiety and pain score and improve the sense of control during labor of primiparas. This nursing method has clinical promotion and application value.

AB The paper, with Neuroeducation as theoretical support, has explored the application of the neuroscientific assessment method to the assessment of classroom teaching process. Firstly, the scientific idea of monitoring and evaluating classroom teaching process is put forward. Secondly, the experiments of comparison of attention index and emotional index of different students in the course of learning,evaluation of teaching effect of two teachers in different teaching part and ERPs analysis of facial expression classification by teachers at different levels are conducted respectively. These sample experiments are used to illustrate the application of neuroscience to the assessment of classroom teaching process. This method can evaluate teachers' teaching ability, students' learning ability, students' learning effect, course content selection and other aspects related to teaching. And more importantly, it can provide objective evaluation basis for classroom teaching process. It is expected that this method can efficiently help solve the problems in the existing evaluation methods of classroom teaching process.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Circadian rhythm; LED lighting; short-wavelength ratio characteristics;
   natural light; effect analysis
AB The short-wavelength ratio of natural light that changes a day cycle helps maintain the circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is a phenomenon in which the flow of physical activity is repeated every 24 hours and is synchronized mainly by natural light. However, since people's exposure time to artificial lighting has increased recently, the issue of circadian rhythm imbalance has been raised, and lighting techniques for reproducing the color temperature or wavelength characteristics of natural light have been proposed. There has not been any case for the short-wavelength ratio cycle reproduction of natural light close to the circadian rhythm; thus, a circadian rhythm-assisted LED light that reproduces the short-wavelength ratio of natural light for one day is presented in this paper, and its effect is confirmed through animal experiment. After the lighting control standard is derived through the analysis of natural light characteristics, its periodic short-wavelength ratio is realized through the control of each LED lighting channel. Subsequently, rat-based animal experiment is conducted to analyze the amount of melatonin, a major factor in circadian rhythm. The results confirm that the proposed lighting environment has higher melatonin levels by about 17% (day7) and 24% (day14) compared with the general lighting environment.

AB The fluctuation of the stock market has always been a matter of great concern to investors. People always hope to judge the trend of the stock market through the trend of the K line, so as to obtain the price difference through trading, Therefore, it is a theoretical research concerned by the academic circles to carry out empirical research through big data stock volatility prediction algorithm, so as to establish a model to predict the trend of the stock market. After decades of development, China's stock market has gradually matured in continuous exploration. However, compared with the stock market in developed countries, there are still imperfections. For example, the market value of China's stock market does not improve well with economic growth. Year-on-year growth and the development of the real economy. By studying the historical data from 2002 to 2017, we use the Multivariate Mixed Criterion Fuzzy Model (MMCFM) to predict the price changes in the stock market, and obtain the market in China through error statistical analysis. (SSE) is more unstable than the US stock market. Therefore, Multivariate Mixing Criterion (MMC) can be used as a reference indicator to visually measure market maturity. In this paper, we establish a multivariate mixed criteria fuzzy model, and use big data to predict the stock volatility. The algorithm verifies the reliability and accuracy of the model, which has a good reference value for investors.

AB Ecological civilization construction and rural revitalization is a strategic decision made by the central government to solve the problems of ecological protection and rural sustainable poverty alleviation. At present, the dominant agricultural operation modes in China can be roughly divided into three types: family farm mode, agricultural enterprise mode and cooperative mode. Practice has proved that different agricultural operation modes have different effects. In ecological fragile areas, how to adopt agricultural operation modes can not only promote agricultural prosperity and increase farmers' income, but also protect the ecological environment and promote the coordinated development of ecology and economy needs further analysis. Based on the current rural revitalization strategy and ecological protection background, this paper analyzes the operation mechanism of agricultural operation mode from the principal-agent and ecological land rent theory, and analyzes the development dimensions of advantageous agriculture of various modes. On the basis of rural and farmers, this paper provides references for the selection of agricultural operation mode in different regions. There are many factors that need to be considered in the choice of agricultural operation mode in ecological fragile area. In the future, each region should conduct analysis and treatment according to its own actual situation.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB In order to improve the 3D reconstruction capability of high-resolution fine-grained 3D images, a fast 3D image reconstruction algorithm based on artificial intelligence technology is proposed. The cross-gradient sharpening detection method is used to collect features and extract information from high-resolution fine-grained three-dimensional images, and establish an edge contour feature detection model for high-resolution fine-grained three-dimensional images. Combining the salient feature analysis method and the subspace feature analysis method to cluster and analyze the high-resolution fine-grained three-dimensional image. In the artificial intelligence environment, the saliency of the three-dimensional image is detected and analyzed, and the multi-dimensional segmentation and gray histogram of the high-resolution fine-grained three-dimensional image are reconstructed through the subspace segmentation method. According to the reconstruction results of the gray histogram, fast 3D image reconstruction and image fusion processing are performed. Finally, the accurate detection and recognition of the reconstructed image is realized. The simulation results show that this method has a good effect on 3D image reconstruction, and the time cost of image reconstruction is relatively short. It improves the recognition and feature analysis capabilities of high-resolution fine-grained 3D images, and has good application value in the reconstruction, detection and recognition of high-resolution fine-grained 3D images.

AB During the COVID-19 pandemic, Online Tutoring Platforms (OTPs) have been applied extensively in education in China. The aim of this study is to investigate the determinants that influence college students' behavioural intention of using OTPs to acquire knowledge. This study also explores how students' attitude change in using OTPs five months after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic based on a hierarchical component model which is combined by the Social Impact Theory (SIT) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Partial least squares (PLS) analysis is employed to analyse the data collected from 1133 students in Mainland China. The results of the analysis indicate that social impact consists of three dimensions (compliance, identification, internalization) significantly influences college students' attitude toward OTPs and further affects college students' behavioural intention toward OTPs usage. Furthermore, performance expectancy and effort expectancy also positively affect students' behavioural intention toward using OTPs to acquire knowledge. This study makes several suggestions for universities to encourage students using OTPs to cope with the situation of Covid-19 pandemic and for educators to promote online tutoring for reforming universities in the future.

In this paper, the structure form, prefabricated construction method and support unloading process of the gymnasium are introduced in detail. To ensure smooth construction unloading, the deflection deformation of the large span floor and the field splicing node are monitored. Results show that the prefabricated construction method of the Mianyang Fule International School Gymnasium and the steel column-scaffold combination support system are affordable. After unloading, the floor has the traits of plates and relatively greater rigid reserve. Thus, it is applicable for large-span and high-load floor structure. The stress in the splicing node in the inflection point (L/2, L is the size of the grid) is relatively small, the bolt and the shearing-resistance plate have no slump, and the field splicing node is safe and reliable. The findings provide a certain reference value for the research and innovation in the process of assembly construction of multi-storey and large-span building.

AB In order to study the application of positive psychology in college teaching, a questionnaire survey is conducted by selecting freshmen and related subject teachers of xx schools, and the collected data are statistically analyzed through the constructed data analysis model platform. Then, the effect of positive psychology in college teaching is analyzed. Through the research, the results show that when analyzing the positive state of students, most students in life are more active, but in the high school, there are fewer active students, most of them know some compulsory knowledge points to meet the final exams. Most of the students' positive state of learning needs to be improved, and the enthusiasm and initiative of learning are not enough to make any benefit to learning. When analyzing the positive state of teachers, it is found that teachers are more motivated in life. The enthusiasm in the classroom is general, and nearly 80% of the teachers believe that the enthusiasm of life is helpful to the enthusiasm of the classroom; when analyzing the implementation of the three-dimensional goal, it is found that although the teacher emphasizes the importance of the goal of emotional values, less than half of the actual implementation has been put in place. In the analysis of the necessity and feasibility of infiltrating positive psychology in college teaching, it is believed that the use of positive psychology guidance can reduce the burden on students and cultivate positive emotions, scientific values and attitudes towards life. The results show that through the investigation and analysis of the application of positive psychology in college teaching, although there are some shortcomings in the research process, it can still provide reference basis for the application of positive psychology in teaching, with a view to provide a guiding direction for the improvement of future teaching level of colleges and universities.

AB Student loans are popular among university in support of young people to afford tuition fees, as US change its financial aid policy from grants to loans. Thus, the efficiency in student loan market is very important for the development of higher education, especially, human capital formation in this process. To complement the centerpiece for the relationship between human capital formation, credit market and economic performance in long run, a model which is derived from Boyd and Smith' to explore the role of information cost in the market. This work tried to indicate the fact that, higher development in credit market reduces the information cost in student loans, which would lead to higher contribution of human capital formation to economic growth.

AB Agricultural modernisation is a way for China to implement its strategy of 'Rural Revitalisation' and comprehensively build a modern socialist country. Based on a two-sector theoretical model, this paper explores the factors restraining the transformation from traditional to modern agriculture and their relationship with economic growth. Using a sample of 31 provinces and cities in mainland China from 1990 to 2016, the results show that the relative price of industrial and agricultural products has a direct impact on the willingness of people to adopt modern technology. Specifically, the relative price of industrial and agricultural products forms a single combined threshold for agricultural modernisation, while the relative productivity of industry and agriculture form a double threshold for per capita GDP, these also show a significant nonlinear relationship. Moreover, the agricultural modernisation of the provinces and cities in the mainland of China is not randomly distributed. There are hot spots with high-value aggregations. The relative productivity has a significant spillover effect on per capita income, and has a negative impact on per capita income in neighbouring areas. Agricultural modernisation can breakthrough economic stagnation and become the driving force for the economy to enter a new round of growth.

AB This paper analyzes the basic background of competency research and reviews the relevant research literature. It is believed that competence, as a term, is different in different languages and cultures; the connotation of competence is not completely the same from the perspective of different disciplines. For example, psychology, organizational behavior, enterprise strategic management and philosophy have different focuses on the study of competence, so there are obvious differences in their connotations. It is proposed that the ability of innovative talents is composed of general ability and specialty It is composed of two parts. In addition to general ability, it also includes professional ability, practical innovation ability, special skill, risk bearing ability, team cooperation ability, communication ability, social adaptability ability, democratic participation and management ability, moral ability, competitive ability and sustainable development ability.

AB The effective integration of CDIO education philosophy and the cultivation of innovative talents is an effective way to carry out the education of Transportation Engineering. With the changes in the transportation industry, the current transportation engineering education is difficult to meet the market's urgent demand for innovative engineering and technical personnel, mainly due to outdated teaching content and teaching methods, imperfect evaluation system, and imperfect teaching team construction. According to the above-mentioned problems, we should adjust to form a teaching mode suitable for innovative transportation talents. Based on the in-depth study of the existing deficiencies, this article uses the CDIO (conceive, design, implement, operate) to combine the cultivation of transportation engineering talents with the actual needs of the enterprise. By enriching educational resources, optimizing the educational evaluation system, and improving the practical teaching system, the quality and level of transportation engineering education will be effectively improved to achieve the goal of training innovative talents. The optimized teaching mode has a certain reference function for the discipline construction and innovative talent cultivation of engineering majors in colleges and universities.

For the vivid three-dimensional representation of three-dimensional geometric figures in teaching, not only is it limited to the geometric composition of a piece of chalk, but more with the wide application of multimedia technology, multimedia-assisted teaching, especially multimedia-assisted three-dimensional geometric figure teaching is playing more and more The important role, through the aid of multimedia, has cultivated students' spatial abstract thinking ability and ability to understand graphics and theorems. As multimedia becomes more and more concerned by the education community, this paper is about the question of why multimedia technology should be used to assist the teaching and application of solid geometry applications, and how to apply multimedia technology to achieve the maximum value of the teaching effect of stereo geometry. A lot of experimental research has been carried out. Through experiments, we have built a more complete multimedia assistant teaching system, which is beneficial for students to acquire new knowledge on the Internet. The multimedia technology-assisted three-dimensional geometric method is more conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm and initiative of students than the traditional method. The biggest innovation of this paper is to use the indispensable advantages of traditional teaching to discount the media to the network platform. To some extent, the research in this paper enhances the guiding significance of interactive research to the actual development work.

AB As the most historically and culturally valuable city district in Nanning, Xingning Block has gradually formed its own unique color characteristics and architectural style in the slow process of urban historical development, showing the unique local customs and architectural features. However, restricted by the specific development conditions, many undesirable aspects can be found in the overall architectural landscape color of some nodes on the block, such as lack of systematic planning, poor material matching, messy building color, as well as various challenges of contemporary social development to the architectural environmental color on the block.The architectural environmental color of urban traditional blocks is an important part of the specific history, culture and spirit of the times of a city, which plays a vital role in the development and change of the city. Therefore, how to effectively and reasonably do a good job in sustainable urban planning and development is an issue that must attract the attention of competent authorities at all levels, scientific research institutions and planning practitioners.

AB With the great success of crowdsourcing business models in the context of the sharing economy, how crowdsourcing services work has gained wide attention. Based on the value co-creation theory, taking ZBJ website of Chinese crowdsourcing service platform ranking first on the Alexa platform as an example, the paper constructs the value co-creation process model of crowdsourcing services under the sharing economy from a dynamic perspective through qualitative analysis of the cases of employers and service providers and interview data. It opens the black box of the value co-creation process. Its contribution is that it proposes the dynamic changing rule of three-dimensional interaction, integration and authorization of crowdsourcing service value co-creation, the change of the role of crowdsourcing main body, and the function mechanism of crowdsourcing service value co-creation on crowdsourcing performance. And the value co-creation mode of different stages is determined. The value co-creation mode is the dominant logic of "service + product" In the release task phase. The value co-creation mode is the value creation of user-led logic originally in the stage of contract submission. The value co-creation mode is the dominant logic of "product + service" in the evaluation and reward stage.

DT Article; Early Access
DE CFO power; earnings management; China
AB In combination with the unique cultural and institutional background of China, this paper puts forward the measurement of CFO power in the Chinese context, and systematically analyzes and tests the role of CFO power. The empirical results show that the greater the power of CFO, the lower the degree of earnings management of the company, indicating that the power of CFO is more of a supervisory role, rather than collusion with the CEO due to interests binding. And the inhibition effect only exists in the sample group of private enterprises. Moreover, the supervision role of CFO power only exists in companies with high robustness and severe agency conflict, which shows that CFO reduces their company's earnings manipulation based on their own conservation and by suppressing opportunism. In addition, CFO power helps improve the effectiveness of their own compensation contracts.

AB With the continuous development of China's economy, the level of science and technology has been improved to a great extent. The advent of the era of Internet and cloud computing has brought a major change to China. However, with the advent of the era of big data, a bigger technological change is coming. The arrival of the era of big data has brought a certain impact on China's enterprise management and decision-making, and put forward higher requirements for China's enterprise management and decision-making. Therefore, enterprises need to constantly strive to improve themselves so as to better adapt to the era of big data. In order to keep pace with the development of The Times, major companies and enterprises need to constantly change their internal management methods in order to achieve sustainable and stable development in their own fields and make their management decisions smoother. Among them, optimization and reform of the application of big data are particularly important. Starting from the characteristics of big data and its role in enterprise management decisions, this paper analyzes the current situation of big data management within enterprises and discusses the influence of big data on enterprise management decisions from five aspects, namely, environment, data, participants, organization and technology. And this paper analyzes the construction method and design idea of enterprise decision support system based on artificial intelligence.

DT Article; Early Access
DE The openness of meteorological data; regional economic; dynamic
   relationship
AB Based on the data from 31 provincial administrative regions in China from 2003 to 2018, this paper uses the panel VAR model to study the dynamic relationship between the meteorological data sharing capability and regional economic development. The research results show that the meteorological data sharing capability can make a significant difference in a small part of the regional economic development. Relatively speaking, regional economic development has a greater impact on the amount of meteorological data sharing. This study innovatively seeks and establishes data association between meteorological engineering field and regional economic field, and provides a new idea for meteorological data research from the perspective of external macro environment.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Grading system; deep learning; image recognition; machine learning
AB According to the survey, off-line examination is still the main examination method in universities, primary and secondary schools. The grading processing of off-line examination is time-consuming. Besides, since the off-line grading is subjective, it is error-prone. In order to address the challenges in off-line examinations of universities, primary and secondary schools, it is very urgent to improve the efficiency of off-line grading. In order to realize intelligent grading for off-line examinations, we exploit deep learning techniques to off-line grading. First, we propose an image processing method for English letters. Second, we propose a image recognition method based on deep learning for English letters. Third, we propose a lightweight framework for grading. Based on the above designs, we design an intelligent grading system based on deep learning. We implement the system and the result shows that the intelligent grading system can batch grading efficiently. Besides, compared with related designs, the proposed system is more flexible and intelligent.

ID EULER-BERNOULLI BEAM; VIBRATION; RESONANCE
AB This paper develops a time-varying model for battery tabs based on the parametric excitation of Euler-Bernoulli beams. The instability caused by combination resonance under a high-frequency longitudinal load is considered. A Galerkin procedure is used to discretize the time-dependent problem into the Mathieu equation. The critical axial load is obtained from the transition curve of combination resonance. The effectiveness of the stability analysis was verified by numerical simulations involving longitudinal and bending loads.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Multi-channel surround sound system; multimedia teaching; college
   singing classroom; feasibility analysis
AB The multi-channel surround system used for multimedia teaching can bring more powerful auditory effects to the audience, and can fully mobilize students' interest and enthusiasm in learning. Such as music arrangement, Yunnan musical instruments, the sound characteristics of national music and national musical instruments, and the sound processing knowledge of music processing. You can quickly master basic music arrangement, the sound characteristics of musical instruments, and the knowledge of mixing and processing music. Achieve better teaching results. Most multimedia devices on the market, with the music and sound effects, a high compression mono or stereo transmission. This mono or stereo transmission with a high compression ratio is very low quality. Since audio is far less powerful than visual impact, and the capacity of the disc used to store audio is small, people tend to focus on visual information processing, but ignore the importance of audio. Multi-channel surround sound technology has received more and more attention in the teaching practice of film and television colleges, but it is also affected by various factors such as venue facilities. This has caused bottlenecks in teaching in this field and has greatly affected the teaching effect. This paper designs and constructs a mobile multi-channel surround sound teaching system from a practical perspective. As part of a multimedia teaching device, try to use the best digital surround sound system for today's audio reproduction. The feasibility of entering the digital surround sound system into the multimedia teaching classroom is analyzed. Better promote students' correct understanding of audio and use modern high-tech digital technology to spread real art.

AB Based on social cognitive theory, this research examines the collective effects of individual behaviours (learning motivations and learning strategies) and environmental factors (mentorship effectiveness, course experience, and research training environment) on DBA candidates' research self-efficacy. Based on data from 156 questionnaires collected from Jinan University and Shanghai Jiaotong University in China, this study adopts an fsQCA approach and concludes that (1) DBA candidates' research self-efficacy stems from all three sets of factors, including learning motivations, learning strategies, and environmental factors. These factors, at either a high level or a low level, combine to generate a number of antecedent configurations; (2) environmental factors, especially mentorship effectiveness and course experience, substantially boost DBA students' research self-efficacy; (3) unlike environmental factors, learning motivations and learning strategies seem to have limited effects on the development of research self-efficacy and act more as contributing conditions than core conditions. This paper makes theoretical contributions to the research fields of both DBA and research self-efficacy.

AB This work aims at solving complex problems of the optimal scheduling model of active distribution network, teaching strategies are proposed to improve the global search ability of particle swarm optimization. Moreover, based on the improved Euclidean distance cyclic crowding sorting strategy, the convergence ability of Li Zhiquan algorithm is improved. With the cost and voltage indexes of the energy storage system of the distribution network as the goal, different optimized configuration schemes are constructed, and the improved HTL-MOPSO algorithm is adopted to find the solution. The results show that compared with the traditional TV-MOPSO algorithm, the proposed algorithm has better convergence performance and optimization ability, and has a lower economic cost. In short, the algorithm proposed can provide a basis for improving the optimization of active distribution network scheduling strategies.

DE Attribute studentized fuzzy interval-valued chart; normalized
   transformation; average run lengths; fuzzy
AB The attribute data, in general, is as important as variable data for data analysis and quality control which can offer more information and modify the error. And to change the type of multiple observations is applied to enhance the effect of control chart. In this thesis, the approach of normalized transformation would be employed to transfer the attribute data become variable data and extend the data type of interval observation. Using the transfer result construct a new control chart, attribute studentized fuzzy interval-valued (ASFIV) chart, with attribute fuzzy interval-valued data which is used to control the shift of quality characteristics for the manufacturing, electrical industry, traditional industry, education science and management fields where quality characteristics include the education score, sales satisfaction, numbers of defective product and so on. The ASFIV chart with interval observation of quality characteristic can point out the variation and degree of shift for the controlled characteristic in various industries. As the interval-valued quality characteristic, to be more specific, is generated which is faster detection the shift than the approach of traditional control chart. Moreover, the numerical studies are used to explain the significant consequent for application of the new ASFIV chart in this study. As such, the studentized fuzzy chart by attribute interval-valued observations could obtain the effective measurement outcome by the attribute data for the practical phenomena and provide related information for decision making of education policy, performance management and sustainable development of industry etc.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Shock wave overpressure of gas explosion; GMM; MCMC; optimization;
   random; accuracy
AB Using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) random sampling, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) of the overpressure of a blast shock wave based on parameter optimization of an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy of sampling. The probability of an explosion caused by gas accumulation under different conditions is obtained from statistics of gas explosion accidents. The explosion equivalent and shock wave overpressure are estimated by using field gas data. The data sets of different types of gas explosions and their corresponding density distribution functions are established. The EM algorithm is used for iterative calculation, and the optimal distribution of each gas explosion data set is obtained. The parameters are built according to a posteriori optimization. A state transition matrix is used to achieve numerical inversion of the overpressure of an MCMC gas explosion shock wave. The inversion results are based on the actual conditions of the mine. On the premise of improving the accuracy of the random simulation, the overpressure value of shock wave is more in line with the law of disaster change, which provides theoretical support for safety protection during a disaster.

DE Hypersonic vehicles; attitude control; modeling; disturbances
AB Hypersonic vehicles often use the aerodynamic configuration and light materials such as lifting body and waverider, which leads to the unmatched uncertain control problems caused by strong coupling characteristics and interference during reentry. To solve these problems, firstly, this paper analyzes the key factors and uncertainties that affect the attitude motion of hypersonic vehicle. Secondly, it studies the modeling and verification of rigid body and elastic body of hypersonic vehicle, establishes the error model with disturbance observation compensation, and proposes a new attitude control scheme of hypersonic vehicle, which realizes the stable tracking of attitude angle and improves the uncertainty of key parameters of the system. The simulation results show that the performance index meets the requirements and has good robust performance in the presence of unknown disturbance.

AB STRING is an important concept in geometry and physics, and is closely related to the distribution of energy system. This paper finds a geometric phenomenon that some properties of two-dimension STRING also exists in multiple-dimension STRING and proposes a STRING theorem from a dimension to high dimension. On this basis, an algorithm is designed to demonstrate the theorem and verify it. The concept of quantum energy density function is established to reveal the energy density conversion rule, and change trend between low-dimensional space and high-dimensional space in the framework of string theory.

DT Article; Early Access
DE YOLOv3; FPN; Darknet; object detection; deep learning
AB YOLOv3 is a deep learning-based real-time object detector and is mainly used in applications such as video surveillance and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we proposed an improved YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) applied Duplex FPN, which enhanced large object detection by utilizing low-level feature information. The conventional YOLOv3 improved the small object detection performance by applying FPN (Feature Pyramid Networks) structure to YOLOv2. However, YOLOv3 with an FPN structure specialized in detecting small objects, so it is difficult to detect large objects. Therefore, this paper proposed an improved YOLOv3 applied Duplex FPN, which can utilize low-level location information in high-level feature maps instead of the existing FPN structure of YOLOv3. This improved the detection accuracy of large objects. Also, an extra detection layer was added to the top-level feature map to prevent failure of detection of parts of large objects. Further, dimension clusters of each detection layer were reassigned to learn quickly how to accurately detect objects. The proposed method was compared and analyzed in the PASCAL VOC dataset. The experimental results showed that the bounding box accuracy of large objects improved owing to the Duplex FPN and extra detection layer, and the proposed method succeeded in detecting large objects that the existing YOLOv3 did not.

AB Named data networking (NDN) is a typical representation and implementation of information-centric networking and serves as a basis for the next-generation Internet. However, any network architectures will face information security threats. An attack named interest flooding attack (IFA), which is evolved, has becomes a great threat for NDN in recent years. Attackers through insert numerous forged interest packets into an NDN network, making the cache memory of NDN router(s) overrun, interest packets for the intended users. To take a comprehensive understanding of recent IFA detection and mitigation approaches, in this paper, we compared nine typical approaches to resolving IFA attacks for NDN, which are interest traceback, token bucket with per interface fairness, satisfaction-based interest acceptance, satisfaction-based push back, disabling PIT exhaustion, interest flow control method based on user reputation and content name prefixes, interest flow balancing method focused on the number of requests on named data networking, cryptographic route token, Poseidon local, and Poseidon distributed techniques. In addition, we conducted a simulation using Poseidon, a commonly used IFA resolution approach. The results showed that Poseidon could resolve IFA issues effectively.

   system
AB With the rapid development of modern computer technology, computer information management system has basically replaced the information statistics based on handwritten records. Due to the rapid development of computer technology, big changes have happened in people's way of life. Accordingly, along with the network technology and the computer technology development, the teaching method also develops rapidly. From the initial projection technology to the current multimedia classroom, microphone audio screen is available. At present, most online teaching platforms provide students with a unified teaching process, and cannot provide corresponding learning resources according to the different characteristics of learners. In order to ameliorate the efficiency of educational information, it is necessary to arouse the enthusiasm of students in the process of learning, and a variety of multimedia network learning platforms begin to be established. English euphemism is also very important in English teaching, which can improve teachers' teaching level, and secondly, improve students' oral English communication level. In this paper, a network teaching system embedded in English euphemism database is proposed to provide more convenience and resources for teachers and students to learn English. Through the technology of network, database and so on, the design of the network teaching platform is realized successfully. Finally, through the actual test and investigation, the utility of the system is fully affirmed. The application of English euphemism teaching in multimedia has a very profound foundation.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Triple independent; physical health level; subject status; mode change;

AB The teaching reform of "Triple independent" in college physical education has been implemented in Colleges and universities all over the country since 2003. The serious problems of "students' physical health level is still the obvious short board of students' quality,("vertical bar")poor eyesight and physical health level are still the short board of students' quality" have not been overcome and solved.(2) It is of great significance to study the birth and development mechanism of students' short physical health level for enhancing students' physical fitness and promoting the healthy development of teenagers. According to the idea that the connection between causes and results is the connection between things or phenomena, the retrospective perspective based on the "Triple independent" teaching mode of sports and the experience and practice beyond "point" and "level" are adopted. Based on the characteristics of "Triple independent" teaching mode and the problems existing in the implementation of "Triple independent" teaching mode and the countermeasures to solve the problems, two explanatory variables of "Triple independent" freedom and project diversity of students are extracted. Through the analysis of the two explanatory variables caused by the qualitative comparative analysis method, it is concluded that the main position of "Triple independent" of students is the effective condition configuration that causes the short board of students' physical health level. The results show that the contradiction between the students' independent choice of curriculum content and the setting of sports events, the contradiction between the students' independent choice of teachers and PE teachers are the main contradiction of the "Triple independent" Teaching mode and the root of the defect of the "Triple independent" Teaching mode. The crux of the teaching reform of "Triple independent" lies in the understanding and interpretation of the subject status of students' Triple independent. The teaching mode of "Triple independent" in physical education is to teach students in the main position of "Triple independent". The virtual teaching objectives and the lack of depth in teaching are the reasons for the short physical health level of students. The teaching reform of "Triple independent" in Physical Education in Colleges and universities, whose form is greater than content, is the reform of teaching methods, not the reform of teaching content.

AB Advanced robust controller design methods such as: H infinity, mu synthesis, or linear matrix inequality require advanced mathematics which makes these techniques difficult topics for final year projects. A robust controller (for plants with parametric uncertainty) can be designed with the aid of Kharitonov's theorem, which has simpler mathematical machinery.
   This paper studies the robust control of DC-DC converters with the aid of Kharitonov's theorem. It presents a tutorial exposition of robust controller design based on Kharitonov's theorem. Kharitonov's theorem provides a good starting point for BSc students who wish to continue their future studies in robust control.

AB Developing user-friendly learning platform tailored to illustrating the integrative nature of specific subjects can be very effective in enhancing the involvement of students in the classroom. The focus of this paper is twofold; first, highlighting a specific project from a teaching perspective for the design and implementation of a multipurpose experimental test facility for plug-in electric vehicle, renewable energy and energy storage management in the smart grid context. Second, proposing the application of this project as an interactive tool to assist in demonstrating the system behaviour, when teaching the new emerging subjects in power engineering courses particularly, Smart Grid. Indeed, the scope of the test facility with the developed simulation tool is specially structured and oriented to education, training and research studies, where problem-based learning can be easily implemented. The electrical test hardware in this design can be operated independently as a multipurpose experimental setup for plug-in electric vehicle. In addition, it can also be interconnected with a small size wind or photovoltaic system to facilitate a complete hybrid integrated platform for testing and model verification. A variety of illustrative examples are presented to show the features of the test facility with its operation and how the components of this facility were selected. Additionally, several test scenarios are depicted using the developed simulation tool, which cover the assessment of grid integration with its components in the event of unforeseen circumstances. A recommendation that can be drawn from this paper is to motivate academics who are actively involved in conducting research on smart grid, to make use of their hardware or software designs in the process of teaching and learning so that undergraduate students can get the opportunity of observation and experimentation. In this sense, suggestions for future work are proposed.

DE Cross-country faults; fault location; fuzzy inference system
AB Locating cross-country faults in a parallel transmission line is a critical and challenging task because faults occur at different locations. In this paper, an accurate fuzzy inference system scheme which provides fault location results for cross-country faults is presented. The fault information from single end of the parallel transmission line is used. A 400 kV, parallel transmission line is designed in MATLAB while fuzzy inference system scheme is modeled with Fuzzy Logic Toolbox. A "MAMDANI" type of fuzzy inference system with triangular member functions is modeled for attaining the fault distance. The fault information in voltages and currents is captured. Then, the impedances in each phase is computed and given as input to fuzzy inference system which aims to locate the faulty location. The simulation results attest that it is able to precisely locate faults in transmission lines without justifying the classification. The results are also compared with existing fault-location methods to describe salient features of fuzzy inference system scheme.

DE Environmental information disclosure; economic performance; corporate
   governance; genre analysis
AB Environmental information disclosure is gradually gaining popularity, especially under the severe environmental pollution. Analyzing the relations among environmental information disclosure (EID), corporate governance and economic performance by employing a cross-disciplinary and a cross-sectional approach is a new start for improving environmental disclosure. The Ordinary Least Square results suggest that, firstly, firm size and ownership structure have significant positive relations with EID and economic performance. Secondly, the factors of corporate governance including the equity concentration ratio, logarithm of management incentive, logarithm of management shareholding, the board size and the number of directors, all have positive influences on EID. Thirdly, corporate governance has an impact on firm's economic performance. Lastly, this study reveals that EID positively affects firm's financial performance-solvency, operational capability and profitability. It is expected that this study can highlight the importance of environmental awareness of professional genre and enhance the environmental disclosure.

AB This study investigates the integration concerns of next-generation renewable energy systems, in which the grid is turning more disseminate and accessible. In this case, the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) based wind energy conversion systems are expected to be more beneficial. Provision of power quality improvement such as Harmonic Reduction is the basic key to obtain higher utilization of wind energy. This functionality for future systems leads to lower energy cost, and reliable power system. To incorporate the advanced features, a five level cascaded H - bridge inverter, with reduced number of power electronic switches is progressed in this study, that is configured within the renewable source systems such as solar and wind. The study is carried out on a 10 KW PMSG based wind energy conversion system interfaced to grid. The proposed concept is elucidated through modelling, simulating and analysing in MATLAB/Simulink environment.

AB The methodology that increases the student interest and provides modern knowledge to the study of the p-n junction theory has been proposed. It is based on two methods: increasing the interest of students using a new approach in derivation of equations of the law of the junction that allows obtaining more comprehensive knowledge about the operation of the p-n junctions and engaging students using the storytelling technique. The reaction of students to the lecture, obtained statistics on the student activity and the results of the student survey show that the proposed methodology allows increasing the student engagement in the p-n junction theory lectures.

AB The purposes of this study are to explore the core competency content of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS) students. This study uses document analysis and focus group methods to confirm the core competency content. It was found that the core competencies of EECS students clearly defined the direction of the students' development especially mathematics ability, scientific and engineering knowledge, implementation, design and analysis, self-study, communication, social development and ethics with high degrees of overlap. This also means that, in addition to mathematical logic, EECS students should also have knowledge related to engineering science, implementation ability, communication and cooperation, and social networking ability. Finally, recommendations for cultivating the core competencies of EECS students were proposed in the hope that graduates will acquire the core competencies required by the industry.

AB Electric power systems allocate a certain amount of production capacity to provide uninterrupted power, which should be optimal and reliable. Thus, the power system can continue to operate regularly and sustainably without the need for a sudden interruption of some production units or an unforeseen load increase. For this, the optimum amount of reserves should be kept ready, which is one of the serious resources used by the power system to prevent fundamentally unpredictable failures. In this study, while the unit is being allocated, three parameters will be considered in determining the optimum reserve amount, which are the units with production costs, line losses, and reliability. In the system used as 22 Bus, each of these three impressive factors was analysed for the appropriate spinning reserve cost by adding an account and compared with eight different case studies. As a result of the calculations, the most reasonable cost of the result, in which line losses have a very low effect, evaluated in terms of production cost and reliability. As a result, when the reserve is allocated to the units in power systems, the right policy for the most appropriate planning is proposed to ensure sustainable and uninterrupted electricity.

AB The pace of technological change is accelerating, the duration of the trends is becoming shorter and the number of technological alternatives to solve IT problems grows quickly. Keeping IT higher education course curricula up-to-date becomes more and more challenging. This paper presents an empirical study that aims to assess whether an open-statement and open-solution methodology in an IT-related project-based learning (PBL) course led to the adaptation of the skills learned by students to the trends of the main IT technology domains. The study analyses data from more than 90 projects by students from eight academic years of the course" Project on Information Technologies", carried out by students in the last year of the Bachelor of Science in Informatics Engineering at the Barcelona School of Informatics. Our results identify a high correlation between the technologies chosen in student projects and technological trends, which shows that the methodology encourages students to incorporate the latest technological innovations in their project work plan.

AB Implementation of a complex circuit with hardware components in a conventional way seems to be quite difficult for the students. Resultant wave-shapes may not be accurate and determined values of different parameters may not be exact. Due to inaccurate outcomes and time-consuming process in a conventional way, researchers despond to continue their approach. In this paper, a trainer kit has been developed which is just like a laboratory with necessary components and aims to implement multivibrators (Bistable, Monostable, and Astable) and RC phase shift oscillators in the laboratory. A variable power supply is constructed in the trainer kit that provides 9 V dc to the multivibrators and 15 V dc to the oscillator. Potentiometer, voltage regulator, different active and passive components such as resistors, capacitor, op-amp, transistor, and numerous jumper wires are introduced in this kit. The trainer kit ascertains an easy implementation by eliminating complexity and assures accurate wave-shapes at the oscilloscope within a short time. To validate the proposed system, a survey program has been introduced among many students and faculty members. The outcome of the survey is the demonstration of student and instructor views and opinions which acknowledges the trainer kit as an efficient and compatible working platform.

AB Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) is an emerging technology, a subset of Wireless Sensor Network. WBAN is a collection of pieces of tiny wireless body sensors with small computational capability and communicates short distance using ZigBee or Bluetooth. The main application of WBAN is in healthcare industry like remote patient monitoring. The small pieces of sensor monitor health factors like body temperature, pulse rate, ECG, heart rate etc., and communicate it to the base station or central coordinator for aggregation or for data computation. The final data is communicated to remote monitoring devices through internet or cloud service providers. The main challenge of this technology is dead nodes due to high energy consumption with all the wireless node working on battery. Minimization of the energy consumption extends life of the network. Security is another major challenge. There are possibilities of internal attacks being executed by malicious nodes, creating problems for the network. This paper proposes a model which provides solution for extending the life span of the network by minimizing energy consumption and also proposes model to provide solution for internal soft attacks created within the network through calculation or trust, computation among nodes to identify malicious nodes with the help of social-and QoS-based trust computation for secure clustering and communication. The proposed model is compared with LEACH and LEACH-MM protocol and performance is measured with various parameters.

AB There is an increasing need for innovative educational methods that can motivate and engage students in subjects that are often perceived as difficult or boring. One such approach is the UPCT-Bloopbusters educational project, developed by a group of professors at the Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena (UPCT), Spain, wherein concepts from the fields of physics and technology are presented and exemplified in the classroom through scenes from different movies in conjunction with experiments. The project was conducted on three subjects, one from each of the three bachelor of electrical engineering degree programs offered at the UPCT, namely Physics I, Applied Physics, and Optical Communications. This paper describes the methodology of the educational project and then presents and discusses the academic results of the students involved in terms of success and performance rates both before and after the application of the new methodology. Moreover, the results of a survey carried out on the students are presented. Finally, some of the exercises used in this methodology for the teaching and learning of science based on different movie scenes are provided as examples. The results of the project show that the students were receptive of the methodology and further indicated that it may lead to increased academic performance due to their enhanced understanding of physics and technology concepts.

AB This paper proposes a co-ordinated reactive power control strategy analysis in Line Side Converter (LSC) of Doubly Fed induction generator (DFIG) and in the Automatic voltage regulator (AVR) of synchronous generator (SG) in isolated Dish Stirling solar Thermal(DSTS) - Biomass hybrid power system. This co-ordinated control strategy greatly maintains the autonomous hybrid power system voltage deviation by adjusting the reactive power imbalance caused due to the impulsive reactive power nature of DFIG coupled with the DSTS and load. Gain values of Integral Order Proportional Integral (IO-PI) controller in LSC and AVR are optimized to maintain the system voltage stability. Modern and simple Grey wolf optimization algorithm has been used to extract the superior PI gain values to maintain system stability with less reaction time. The proposed co-ordinated control strategy has been tested with various load disturbance and with dynamic input power feed from DSTS to validate the system robustness. Also, the optimized gain value based voltage deviation values are validated in real time with dSPACE.

AB This paper integrates LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robots into undergraduate control systems course to improve students' learning experiences using Matlab as a development tool. This platform facilitates the students throughout teaching the course in learning the essential concepts of control systems such as modeling, stability analysis, and skill of designing controllers for the dynamic systems. The participants of the course identify the transfer function of the robot and compare it with the transfer function developed by using laws of physics. The students, then compare the identified model with the mathematical model by using stability analysis techniques, finding out that the stability range is much smaller for the experimental model than the mathematical model. After that, several types of controllers are designed and tested on the experimental model and EV3 robots, which demonstrates that there exists discrepancies between conceptual and practical designs. Finally, a comparison of students' apprehension of a set of capabilities before and after taking the course shows the value of using EV3 robots on improving students' learning experiences of control systems course.

AB In recent years, massive open online courses (MOOCs) have become quite popular. Such courses are either completely free or cost nominally. Generally, the MOOCs face the challenge of not being recognized as 'regular' courses (i.e., the ones taken at the traditional learning institutions). One of the main reasons for this lack of acceptability is the assessment in an unsupervised environment, which is prone to the problems of test-taker's online lookups or interaction with others for finding the answers to the test questions. A few ways of alleviating this problem include: limiting the time for answering the questions, the avoidance of repetitive questions, and the creation of a large number of questions. This paper presents a tool named QAgen that enables the automatic creation of a large number of questions and answers related to different topics in computer/electrical engineering (ECE), computer science, physics, etc. Specifically, the tool is related to the courses on digital logic design, computer architecture, etc. The generated questions are in a format that is suitable both for learning management system (LMS) based and/or non-LMS-based assessment in conventional courses or MOOCs. The proposed tool is based on open-source software, thus eliminating the need for any commercial software packages. The underlying principles of QAgen are applicable to other engineering/science courses as well, if the assessment methods require the creation of some connected-object diagrams, tables and equations. For assessing the usefulness of QAgen, practice question sets were created for three different courses. The student surveys for these courses indicated that the questions helped students prepare for actual tests/examinations. Especially favored by the students was the availability of correct answers at the end of each practice test/examination.

AB Detection of plant leaf disease has been considered an interesting research field which is helpful to improve the crop and fruit yield. Computer vision and machine learning based approaches have gained huge attraction in digital image processing field. Several visual computing based techniques have been presented in the past for early prediction of plant leaf diseases. However, detection accuracy is still considered as a challenging task. Hence, in order to overcome this issue, we introduce a novel hybrid approach carried out in three forms. During the first phase, image enhancement and image conversion scheme are incorporated, which helps to overcome the low-illumination and noise related issues. In the next phase, a combined feature extraction technique is developed by using GLCM, Complex Gabor filter, Curvelet and image moments. Finally, a Neuro-Fuzzy Logic classifier is trained with the extracted features. The proposed approach is implemented using MATLAB simulation tool where PlantVillage Database is considered for analysis. The average detection accuracy has been obtained as more than 90% for 2 test cases which shows that the proposed combination of feature extraction and image pre-processing process is able to obtain improved classification accuracy. This work is useful for the students of UG/PG programme to carry out Project-based learning.

AB The challenging task while transmitting the high-quality images over the wireless sensor networks is to achieve the higher throughput, minimum bit error rate without compromising the image quality. As the sensor nodes have the limited processing power, designing energy efficient image transmission is another challenge in this research. This paper proposed a novel method of cooperative image transformation from the transmitter to the receiver for wireless sensor networks. We designed the methods for multi-hop one-way relayed cooperative communication model for wireless sensor networks. We believe that the cooperative communication helps to improve the efficiency of image transmission. The proposed approach focused on efficient relayed image transmission through wireless channels with optimum image quality and bit error rate performances. First, lightweight image quality improvement method was proposed at both transmitter and receiver end as images captured under various illumination conditions. Second, the proposed compressive sensing was performed using the approximation coefficient of 2D discrete wavelet transform. We utilized the wavelet denoising advantage by presenting the hybrid thresholding function. And third, use of decode-forward method at relay nodes to perform the task of decode and forward received image data block. The compressed approximation component of 2D discrete wavelet Transform is further used to apply inverse fast Fourier transform and then in modulation using quadrature phase shift keying to transmit over additive white Gaussian noise channel to relay nodes as per the standard orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing model. The simulation results claim the performance efficiency against the state-of-art methods based on mean square error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and bit error rate.

AB In this paper, a procedure for designing a MATLAB-based virtual robotics laboratory is described that provides a realistic three-dimensional animation for the robot's motion. The proposed laboratory allows students to obtain the linear model and stability condition of a robotic system, without getting involved in its mathematical modeling. The structure of a two-wheeled inverted pendulum robot has been used for demonstrating the laboratory's features. As part of this virtual experiment, design and evaluation of proportional-integral-derivative, model predictive control, and fuzzy controllers for maintaining the two-wheeled inverted pendulum's balance are considered. A set of graphical-user interfaces is designed for providing the interaction with the system. This virtual lab is readily extensible for other robotics structures and controllers, and its output data is promptly available for further analysis by other MATLAB toolboxes.

AB The Residue Logarithmic Number System (RLNS) in digital mathematics allows multiplication and division to be performed considerably quickly and more precisely than the extensively used Floating-Point number setups. RLNS in the pitch of large scale integrated circuits, digital signal processing, multimedia, scientific computing and artificial neural network applications have Fixed Width property which has equal number of in and out bit width; hence, these applications need a Fixed Width multiplier. In this paper, a Fixed Width-Floating-Point multiplier based on RLNS was proposed to increase the processing speed. The truncation errors were reduced by using Taylor series. RLNS is the combination of both the residue number system and the logarithmic number system, and uses a table lookup including all bits for expansion. The proposed scheme is effective with regard to speed, area and power utilization in contrast to the design of conservative Floating-Point mathematics designs. Synthesis results were obtained using a Xilinx 14.7 ISE simulator. The area is 16,668 mu m(2), power is 37 mW, delay is 6.160 ns and truncation error can be lessened by 89% as compared with the direct-truncated multiplier. The proposed Fixed Width RLNS multiplier performs with lesser compensation error and with minimal hardware complexity, particularly as multiplier input bits increment.

AB In the CTTS system, while transferring the power supply from the grid to the generator, a sudden arc arises, which causes damage to the system. The method proposed in this study reduces this damage. The power state of the generator stage is made equal to the state of the power of the grid in order to prevent the occurrence of a sudden arc. Even if the generator power state is the same with the power state of the generator, an arc can be generated due to a sudden current flow during the transfer. Therefore, the current in the generator stage is controlled to 0 (zero) when transferring, so that the generation of an electrical arc is minimized. In general, when the CTTS system is used for transferring power sources with an emergency generator, the impact from the electrical arc will be momentarily proportional to the amount of the power supplied from the generator to the load. The damage by the arc will make the life of the CTTS system shorter. In order to prevent such damage, a blocking technique using parallel capacitor is constituted. However, this causes arc generation at the time of input. Thus, in this paper, it is proposed to control the effective or ineffective power of the system to zero. To verify the validity of the proposed method, firstly the Powersim simulation was conducted, and after confirming the feasibility based on this, the actual prototype was created and implemented. Zero power control is proposed as a way to improve the stability of CTTS by significantly reducing the generation of an electrical arc. And this technique can help people working on the distributed power or the grid management.

AB In this paper, an approach for teaching basic antenna theory and propagation to senior level undergraduate students for electrical engineering related fields is proposed and described. The method combines mathematical and theoretical studies with antenna design and laboratory measurements to reinforce the subject's theoretical and practical aspects together. Topics discussed in lectures include performing antenna radiation calculations, learning how to make antenna radiation pattern measurements, and designing of antennas such as microstrip patch antenna. The education is based on teaching these principles and enabling students to make some antenna measurements. At the end of the semester, an analysis on learning outcomes of the course was performed and feedback from students was taken. The feedback from students showed that there was a huge satisfaction in terms of achieving the goals in learning outcomes. The course structure proposed can be a good example for instructors who teach antennas and propagation courses.

AB Power system analysis (PSA) is the first comprehensive curriculum for the major of electrical engineering at the undergraduate stage. It helps students obtain an overview of the power system, and systematically learn about fundamental theories. However, the traditional teaching of PSA course excessively focuses on the class lecture, and is combined with hardware-based experiments that are restricted due to concerns of security and cost. Enhancing the PSA course has been attempted at Shandong University, China, since 2016, which combines class lecture, laboratory exercises, and practical activities into the daily teaching. In laboratory exercises, project-based learning (PBL) is carried out by using the hardware experimental equipment and self-developed teaching software, VTPCE, hence to enhance students' understandings of knowledge, hands-on abilities, and researching skills. Practical activities are organized by visiting the topic-related institutes to establish the relationships between theories and practices. This paper introduces the architecture, the intended learning objects (ILOs), and the detailed arrangement of the reformed PSA course. The assessment procedures for students are also presented, as well as the satisfaction surveys.

AB Programmable logic controllers (PLC) have been one of the most widely used controllers in industry. They have a graphical programming language interface resambling the relay panels which they are intended to replace so that the transition from relay panels might be swift and smooth. Although learning this programming language is easy, real life experiments are essential for students to gain greater understanding of the logic behind the language. However, it is generally too expensive to provide an experimental set-up for students to test their theoretical knowledge. For this reason, a conveyor and feeder system was developed as a low cost 3D printable design using a CAD program and implemented for use in a control laboratory. Using this conveyor set-up, students can experience how to program a practical example of a PLC devices used in industry together with an introduction to actuators and sensors. Reading actual sensors and using actuators via the inputs and outputs of a PLC to control a real life system will be far more effective than simulator alternatives.

AB In this paper, we present a detailed action plan under continuous quality improvement (CQI) exercise of outcomes based education framework related to Mathematics concerns highlighted by the Electrical Engineering (EE) Department. Failing and low performed student learning outcomes (SOs) and course learning outcomes (COs) in range of core EE courses were observed to be linked with weak Mathematics basis of students. This feedback was achieved through an automated CQI system in EvalTools under Faculty Class Assessment Report(FCAR) tab, where each instructor is required to make reflections about failing as well as low performed SOs and COs. Feedback was reviewed comprehensively, and mathematical concepts which significantly affect the performance of students in the core EE courses were derived. Moreover, a high level of Mathematics pre-requisite covering required mathematical concepts is identified for the range of core EE courses. Consequently, well-defined tasks were assigned to continuously evaluate and monitor improvement in required Mathematics concepts to ensure SOs and COs achieved in core EE courses. Results are given to exhibit the effectiveness of continuous improvement management system (CIMS).

AB 'Electromagnetic Fields and Waves' is an important professional basic course for students in the major of electrical and electronic engineering. Students regard it as the most difficult course because of numerous concepts and equations. Philosophy could assist the students' understanding of the electromagnetic theories. The ChineseYin-Yangprinciple reveals the basic composition and operating principles of the universe from the macroscopic and microscopic view, which provides another way to illustrate the electromagnetic phenomenon and equations. This paper presents a heuristic teaching practice carried out by combining the ChineseYin-Yangprinciple and modern electromagnetic theory. Several lectures on vector analysis, electrostatic field, steady magnetic field, time-varying electromagnetic field, and gravitational field, even relativity and particle theories are given to show the application of theYin-Yangprinciple. Student survey and exam results show that the adoption of Yin-Yang principle could help students to acquire the basic concepts in limited teaching hours and to promote philosophical thinking embodied in China's university education.

AB In a period of rapid adaptation to technology in today's world, limiting education to traditional methods leads to a rapid decline in the perception and interest of the learner. Augmented Reality (AR), which is among the most interesting technological innovation of the last years, are manifested in many sectors. It is used more widely in the field of education thanks to its superior advantages such as being portable, adapting to different devices/equipment, offering interactive digital content and arousing interest. In this study, AR application has been realized for the modeling of N-type MOSFET element, which is one of the basic courses of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and is widely used in analog and digital circuits. The contribution of the application to students' perception of theoretical concepts was also examined. It concluded that AR made an important contribution to the concretization of abstract concepts and the developed educational material increased the motivation of the students.

AB Logistics resources will be concentrated in the same space by logistics park, to provide intensive logistics services and enhance the efficiency of logistics, thereby, a large number of logistics parks emerged in China for a period of time, and the park vacancy rate caused by high attention. Logistics Park construction should be matched with the demand. Calculation of logistics park carrying capacity is one of those problems should be solved. This paper uses the analogy method, the standard reference method and the space-time consumption method to calculate the comprehensive carrying capacity of "one port, six parks", which is planned in Wuhan. The results show that although the space-time consumption method is more complicated than the other two, but its calculation results can better reflect the carrying capacity of Logistics Park.

DE Strategic planning; goals; objectives; strategies; assessment
AB Strategic planning is a tool widely used in business, industries and non-profit organizations and has been recently adopted in academia. However, because their own characteristics, the strategic plans in colleges and universities are mostly developed at an institutional level. As these provide an overview of the organization, they cannot be very detailed and may contain a certain amount of ambiguities in order to satisfy its multiple constituencies. At the institutional level there are limited opportunities to include specific strategies that may affect individual academic programs. To solve these limitations, this paper proposes strategic plans being developed and incorporated at the program level, specifically for electrical engineering or electrical engineering technology programs. The appropriate strategic planning results in strengthen these programs and generate useful and significant dialog among their constituencies. The paper finishes by showing a generic strategic plan for an electrical engineering technology program that can nevertheless, be adopted and modified as needed by faculty and academic staff involved in this process of creating a similar plan for their own electrical engineering programs.

AB The arrival of the era of big data has brought about a new revolution in the education of ecological civilization. Citizen Education of Citizen's Green Development View based on big data is no longer a simple process of knowledge transfer, but a process of continuous knowledge generation and sharing. Big data has brought about the transformation of citizens' Education of Citizen's Green Development View technology. At the same time, it has also formed the integrity and compatibility thinking of citizens' Education of Citizen's Green Development View in the context of big data. This paper is based on the coupling analysis of big data on the citizen Education of Citizen's Green Development View module. Through the coupling of the moral education, knowledge cultivation and behavioral cultivation of citizens' ecological civilization, the design of comprehensive evaluation model, the framework and content were reconstructed, and the evaluation index system of citizen Education of Citizen's Green Development View was established.

AB The quality of construction projects is related to the safety of people's lives and property, and also has a greater impact on the stability of the entire society; factory structure is one of the most common productive buildings, and some factory buildings have been partially lost its using function due to a long service history; in order to ensure the safety, applicability and durability of these factory buildings and continue to utilize or strengthen these factory structures, it is necessary to perform safety testing and identification for factory buildings at the first time. Structural safety assessment is the process of inspecting, measuring, analyzing and evaluating the structural effects, structural resistance and their interrelationships and finally obtaining structural safety grade of buildings that have been built or in service for many years. On the basis of summarizing and analyzing previous research works, this article expounded the research background, current status and future challenges of building safety grade identification, elaborated material testing methods, specifications, frameworks and processes of security grade identification for factory structure buildings, analyzed the concrete strength and steel corrosion detection, structural seismic identification and bearing capacity calculation of factory building, and proposed corresponding reinforcement measures and discussed its reinforcement effect. The final identification results of an engineering case are in good agreement with its actual construction conditions and on-site inspections and basically satisfactory the results of the factory building structure. The study results of this paper provide a reference for the further researches on the safety grade identification and reinforcement effect of the factory structure building.

ID GROWTH
AB Using the Chenery-Syrquin model, this paper investigates the effect of resources reallocation on the TFP of China's service industry from 2003 to 2016.The main findings are as follows: there are significant structural changes in the production factor configuration of various industries within the service industry. The growth of service industry is still driven mainly by factor input. The resource reconfiguration effect has not yet become the main force driving the growth of TFP of the service industry. However, the structural dividend has become more and more obvious after 2008. The marginal production of capital in most service industries has reached a stage of total reduction and rapid convergence, and there is a convergence of marginal returns of capital within the service industry. The marginal production of labor in most service industries is on the stage of decrease in growth rate and increase in the total amount. Although the marginal production of labor still exhibits divergent characteristics, it has begun to show signs of convergence at the end of the study period. There are phenomena of "mismatching resources", and the state control or monopoly industry is more serious. The government should improve the property rights system, expand openness, and formulate supporting policies to different industries to promote the optimal allocation of resources.

ID IMAGES
AB The demand for identifying a reliable person is increased because of security issues in our daily life. At present, to identify a person biometric technique such as face recognition is introduced. Since,a person with abnormal behaviour recognition system has reached certain level, their accomplishments in real time applications are restricted by challenges, such as illumination variations. The present visual recognition system is good at controlled illumination conditions and thermal face recognition system is better for detecting disguised persons or when there is no illumination control. Hence, a hybrid system which uses both visual and thermal images for recognising a person is better. The objective of this research is to implement a method which improves the quality of the image by fusing visual and thermal imaging images. Our research methodology has introduced to enhance servo line camera images. Nonlinear image transfer functions were introduced,and the parameters associated with those functions are determined by image statistics for making adaptive algorithms. Next methodswereintroduced for registering the visual images to their consequent thermal images. To get a transformation matrix for the registration, the landmarks in the images are first detected and a subset of those landmarks were selected to obtain the matrix, we propose a hybrid algorithm for detection, tracking and classification using OFSA algorithm to fuse the registered thermal and visual images. In this research, we focus on object detection using OFSA algorithm for more accuracy.

AB This paper proposed the novel system which can track the car in the local area based on the RFID and Zigbee technology. This system uses the circuit board developed by ourselves. It combined with the PLC, the wireless communication and the database technology. It has designed to display the dynamical positioning of cars in the map of the area through the website. The tags from RFID system carry the automotive information. Then the information recognized by the reader has been transmitted to the upper computer by the Zigbee module. The website on the upper computer query the vehicle's location from database after mapping the fixed position information sent by the reader into the view of the schematic graph. Because the database has stored the vehicle's location. All the obtained records are used to draw the full path of the car and display the current location of the car. This provides the basis for the scientific navigation. The website of the system has been finished in the Visual Studio platform and the Mysql database technology. And it used the B/S architecture and achieved the vehicle tracking. This system also finishes the dynamic light system and improves the management efficiency for vehicles and can be applied widely.

AB In this paper, the "stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R)" analysis framework of environmental psychology is applied to the research of online consumer behavior, and the mechanism of the effect of information quality factors on impulsive buying behavior is discussed. From the perspective of consumer emotion, the paper analyzes the path and mechanism of impulse buying behavior under the stimulation of richness, vividness and reliability characteristics of website information, and the elicitation of consumer pleasure and arousal emotion. A model of impulse buying behavior in network environment is proposed. The structural equation model is used to analyze 333 questionnaires, and the conclusions are as follows: (1) The richness, vividness and reliability of the information on the website positively affect the mood of pleasure; (2) The pleasurable emotion and arousal emotion positively influence the impulse buying behavior; (3) The richness, vividness and reliability of website information positively affect arousal mood is not significant.

AB The Central Asia orogenic belt contains a wide range of structural elements, including micro continent, back arc system, ocean island/plateau, ophiolite and subduction accretion complex. But its final closing time has been controversial. Based on the magmatic age of the surrounding orogenic belt, the source of this set of clastic sediments is determined, which provides new important evidence for the evolution of the South Tianshan orogenic belt. The results show that the Jurassic detrital zircons from the study area were mainly derived from magmatic zircons and are deposited in a proximal source. The detrital zircon age of the Lower Jurassic Badaowan and Sangonghe Formation are concentrated in 290-260 Ma, and in 350-290 Ma and 460-390 Ma, respectively. The detrital zircon age of the Middle Jurassic Xishanyao Formation concentrates in 370-320 Ma and 450-390 Ma. There are very few zircons from the Precambrian period. These ages are consistent with the timing, indicating these clastic sediments were mainly originated from the southern margin of the Yili - Middle Tianshan Block. The Late Permian - Middle Triassic detrital zircons almost do not exist, implying that there were no contemporary magmatism related to collision or post-collision in the South Tianshan district, its complex evolution and orogenic stage are still a challenging topic. In the ancient active plate margin, the sedimentary records in the pre-arc basin can provide more information about the magmatic arc and basin-orogen coupling than the present exposed arc itself. The rhyolite, trachyte, and trachyandesite of the Dahalajunshan Formation were widely developed in the Yili - Middle Tianshan Block during the Early Carboniferous. During the formation of Wulang Formation in the Early Permian, a large number of rhyolite were developed. The age data of 75 detrital zircons were obtained from the sandstone (J1s-5) of the Sangonghe Formation, of which 74 zircons have a concordance degree of over 90%, and their age data also fall on the harmonic curv. In addition, the age of the youngest zircons increased gradually from Early to Middle Jurassic, indicating that the sediments in this period had the feature of uncovering. Our study provides a good reference for the analysis of provenance and regional tectonic evolution.

AB A rapid iterative learning control algorithm with variable forgetting factor is applied for a class of nonlinear system with initial error and time-delay. This algorithm eliminats the limitation that the initial state should be reset to the expected one or fixed value at the start of iteration in the learning process of conventional algorithms. The error and the differences between two adjacent error is adopted to correct the controller avoiding the unstable influence of the derivative for PD type algorithm and the available information is fully used to increase convergence rate. Furthermore variable forgetting factor introduced guaranteed a fast convergence of trajectory tracking error Then, with applying the rapid algorithm to the trajectory tracking control of manipulator, the learning speed and tracking performance are both greatly improved. Meanwhile, the control strategy is proposed for the limitation of each joint rotation. The convergence of the method is also proved theoretically.

TI Neutrosophy theory based visualization report of sports news data

DT Article; Early Access
DE Neutrosophy theory; sports news; visualization; report
AB Based on the Neutrosophy theory, this paper makes an in-depth analysis of the application status and challenges of sports data news visualization reports, so as to provide a valuable reference for the visualization development of sports data news. This paper selects two kinds of large-scale sports events of different types and scales as research objects, uses Excel data statistics method, Newtonian mechanics analysis, chaotic dynamics etc. to define and classify sports media events, and conducts research on visualization report of the evolution rules. The influence of sports media events is positively correlated with the scale of sports events. The evolution process includes three periods as "initial period", "high-tide period" and "decay period", has a similar process periodicity, and shows obvious chaotic characteristics such as initial value sensitivity, intrinsic randomness, fractal similarity, etc. The visualization of sports news data based on the Neutrosophy theory is the application of visualization in the news industry. The basic principle is universal. The difference lies in the fact that the news generalizes and arranges complex data with news value, and plays the role of disseminating news and satisfies the audiences' needs for obtaining information.

AB The work space is the sancto sanctorum of the world's economy. It has become increasingly clear that a functional, efficient work space is conducive to optimum output. Therefore the engineering concepts of comfort and ease of working for long durations have become the mainstay of industries the world over. These concepts are complemented by the inputs of safety, hygiene and worker friendliness especially inthe global garment manufacturing industry. They need to be evaluated scientifically. One of these means is the evaluation by using OCRA. The basic concept of OCRA, therefore, is to determine and measure a defined technical action. It examines the series of complex movements necessary to complete a work task, involving the upper limb joints at the shoulder, elbow, wrist and finger level. Various scholars have documented the root causes of musculoskeletal discomfort among the seated workers and have delineatedthemas the constrained work posture and repetitive tasks. Currently, the researcher is working on three work aid prototypes by incorporating workstation design principles for modifications to improve working posture.

DE Watercolor; techniques; teaching; exploration
AB As a branch of watercolor painting, watercolor light color has been widely used in different fields. In the field of design, designers use the convenience, quickness, transparency and brilliance of watercolor to draw a design drawing. In the field of art creation, watercolor is usually the best choice for painters to go out to sketch and create large-scale drawings. In the field of art education, watercolor tools are easy to carry, low-cost and easy to operate, which can facilitate students' repeated practice and outside Sketching is helpful to cultivate students' sense of color and observation ability. Therefore, as a branch of art curriculum, watercolor light color has a wide range of uses and great practicability, which is worth exploring and studying.

AB Environmental problems such as air pollution are global, and are created by human collective behavior. Accordingly, their remedies call for residents to transform their Pro-environmental behavior (PEB) from individual level to collective level. Based on the perspective of self-identity process and social identity process, this research proposes a comprehensive model by integrating elements from theory of planned behavior (TPB), self-identity theory and social identity theory. To assess the model, we have designed questionnaire and collected the survey data using Questionnaire Star (a professional data platform in China). The data were analyzed using both structural equation model (AMOS) and regression analysis (SPSS). It is found that there exist interactions between individual and collective factors, and their positive influence on PEB of the individuals with varying strengths. The broader view of the model can enhance our understanding regarding the intricate internal structure of ecological behavior, and it can also offer valuable reference when formulating environmental policies and education strategies.

AB This study develops a novel rough-wall model for large eddy simulation (LES) based on recent work on wall-modelled LES. This approach is capable of solving for the basic flow character over a rough wall at high Reynolds numbers without resolving the details of the roughness elements. The wall-modelled LES approach on a smooth wall is proven to be sufficiently precise to predict the velocity profile and wall shear stress. The average roughness shear stress can be combined with the smooth-wall shear stress in the inner-layer wall model by defining a roughness shear stress ratio alpha. The instantaneous shear stresses caused by the roughness elements are calculated by the pressure projection and elevation fields. The total shear stress is fed back to the outer-layer LES mesh as a new boundary condition. The results of the wall-modelled LES correspond well with the experimental data. The comparison between the simulation and experiment reveals that the wall-modelled LES approach presented in this research is capable of predicting the flow in a rough-wall boundary layer without resolving the detailed roughness element geometries.

AB Various faults of photovoltaic (PV) modules inevitably occur in the work process, since PV modules are installed in hostile situation. To obtain the types of failure, a novel fault diagnosis method based on back propagation (BP) neural network with Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) algorithm for PV modules is proposed. Through the in-depth analysis the output of PV modules under normal and fault conditions, the input variables of the diagnosis model are acquired. The high-speed and real-time fault diagnosis model for PV modules is first designed based on TMS320VC5402 DSP and long-distance wireless fault diagnosis is realized by Zigbee technology. The simulation and experimental results show that the fault diagnosis method for PV modules based on BP network with L-M algorithm can effectively detect four types of fault for PV modules such as open circuit, short circuit, partial shading and abnormal degradation. The numerical results verify the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method, which can provide a great educational benefit of PV operation technology.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Due to the continuous introduction of new building technologies, research results, and technical specifications, the design and construction process of buildings has become extremely complex, paying more attention to the sustainable development of the building itself; it not only requires close communication between project participants, but also an in-depth analysis of building performance and structure is required during the design phase. Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology has been widely used in the development of the construction industry in recent years. It can effectively realize the integration of building information, so that all parties involved in the project can work together based on the same platform, which can more effectively improve work efficiency and save resource input, lower construction costs, and ultimately achieve the goal of sustainable development. On the basis of summarizing the previous research results, this paper uses BIM technology to analyze the optimization effect of large-scale construction engineering from the aspects of information model, resource allocation and technology optimization. The analysis results provide reference for subsequent in-depth research.

AB Higher vocational education is a self-consistent system for higher education appropriate to the development of productivity and economy in the world. It aims at training skilled talents, which has made great contribution to the economy and industry. Generally, designing courses in high vocational education includes teaching analysis, teaching strategy, teaching practice and teaching assessment. Among the teaching steps, teaching assessment is one of the most important method to improve the quality of course teaching. However, in most high vocational education courses, traditional written exam is still the primary tools of assessments, which can not fulfill the development of high vocational education. In order to improve the quality of high vocational education, it is very urgent to design a practical and efficient system with multiple assessments. We exploit machine learning techniques to design assessment system for high vocation education. Machine learning is a very powerful tool for data analysis and it has been used for education tools in recent years. First, we improve the teaching organization for training skilled talents. Second, we propose a feature selection model based on the improved teaching organization. Third, we propose a machine learning model for teaching assessment. With the main contributions and other improvements, we design a multi-assessment system for vocational teaching based on machine learning. We implement the multi-assessment system by using Python and TensorFlow, which shows that the system can provide practical and efficient multiple assessments for vocational teaching based on training machine learning model. Compared with other assessment methods, machine learning based multi-assessment is more intelligent and automatic. Besides, it can be extended to other fields of education with slight modifications.

DE Sports lottery; time series; prediction
AB Objective China's sports lottery income is the core power and important economic source of sports development, but it is affected by many complex factors such as society and economy. This paper studies the prediction model of sports lottery income, and provides data support and theoretical basis for relevant government policies Methods: Using the time series data of sports lottery revenue over the years, this paper studies the prediction model, compares the evaluation and selects the appropriate model, and uses the model to predict the future development of sports lottery revenue in China. Results: Through comparison, it is found that the cubic curve model has the best fitting effect on sports lottery income (R2 = 0.994, MAPE = 5.10). Using this model to predict sports lottery, it will exceed 500 billion yuan in 2025. Conclusion: the prediction model of sports lottery revenue in China is suitable to adopt the cubic curve model, which indicates that the sports lottery revenue in China will keep increasing.

DE Rolling bearing; fault detection; wavelet packet; dispersion entropy;
   artificial fish swarm algorithm
AB The support vector machine (SVM) does not have a fixed parameter selection method and the manual selection of parameters is difficult to determine the validity, which affects the accuracy of recognition. simultaneously, The existing coarse-grained approach cannot effectively analyze the high-frequency components of time series. In view of the shortcomings of the above method, we put forward a new technique of rolling bearings for fault detection, which combines wavelet packet dispersion entropy (WPDE) and artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) optimize support vector machines (AFSA-SVM). First of all, wavelet packet is devoted to decompose the original vibration signal into components of different frequency bands. Secondly, the dispersion entropy (DE) are calculated for each of the obtained frequency band components to acquire more comprehensive and complete fault information. Afterward, Input feature samples into the SVM model for training, and AFSA is used to optimize the parameters of SVM to obtain the optimal value so as to establish the best classification model. Finally, the prepared test set is input into AFSA-SVM for fault classification. The achievement of bearing detection experiments show that this approach can accurately and quickly identify fault types.

DE Stochastic resonance; average; image enhancement; noise
ID PEPPER NOISE; REMOVAL; SALT
AB How to extract useful information from noised image is always an important issue for image processing. Many methods have been proposed in image enhancement field. However, in these methods the noise is usually considered as harmful and should be removed as much as possible. Stochastic resonance is a very different method, in which the noise is regarded as a driver to push the stochastic resonance system to output enhanced image. In this paper, the cumulative gain is introduced and the sequence average is used to enhance the original image information which hidden in a noised image sequence produced by bistable stochastic resonance. We present the one-dimensional and two-dimensional stochastic resonance methods and discuss their performance in this paper. Experiments illustrate that the one-dimensional average stochastic resonance has the best performance considering the indicator PSNR and SSIM. Compared with traditional filters such as median and Wiener filters, the proposed methods have significant advantages.

   landscape interaction design
AB With the continuous development of the career of the disabled, special education has become an important part of the development of education in China. Therefore, it is particularly important to meet the needs of special children's campus construction. However, China is relatively backward, and special education schools lack complete landscape design for special groups. Campus landscape carries many contents including education, leisure, communication and rehabilitation. At present, the landscape design of special education schools lacks the recognition of the particularity of special children, and ignores their demands for normal communication and interaction. Starting from the characteristics of special children, this paper analyses and studies the perceptual characteristics of hearing impaired students and visual impaired students respectively, and applies the concept of "interactive design" to the landscape design of special schools. Interaction design pays attention to the process of human experience, which coincides with the design idea of "people-oriented" emphasized in landscape design. Landscape interaction design is the design of human communication, communication and interaction space, so as to guide the campus landscape environment suitable for the barrier-free interaction of actors, make up for defects, provide safe activities, individualized education and living campus.

AB In order to improve the convenience of English education management and improve the quality of teaching, this paper proposes the application of English education information management system based on convolution neural network classification algorithm. Specifically, it relies on spark cloud technology and data mining technology of cash to build an English education information management system. Secondly, in the educational information management platform, convolution neural network classification algorithm is used to mine useful information. Convolution network mainly combines the emotional words, parts of speech, degree adverbs, negatives, punctuation and other word features that affect the emotional tendency of the text to form an extended text feature. Then, the word vector feature and the extended text feature are used as two input channels of convolution neural network, and the dynamic K-max pooling strategy is adopted to improve the ability of feature extraction of the model. The experiment in the English education information management system shows that the classification performance of the algorithm in this paper is not only higher than that of the single channel convolution neural network algorithm, but also has some advantages compared with some representative algorithms. In addition, experiments verify the effectiveness of the educational information management system.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION

DT Article; Early Access
DE Enterprise; social responsibility; mixed strategy; dynamic game
AB In order to analyze the game relationship of corporate social responsibility, this paper uses evolutionary game theory to construct the dynamic game of mixed strategy by using government supervision, enterprises and the public as the main body of the three-party game. The results show that in the tripartite game, the more the expected revenue of government departments, enterprises, and the public increases, the more likely it is that the government departments will adopt a strict supervision strategy and the company will choose to assume social responsibility. The higher the cost of government supervision, the higher the cost of corporate social responsibility, and the more the loss of social welfare. Then the government department adopts a general regulatory strategy, and the company chooses not to assume social responsibility, the more likely the public will give negative evaluation of the company. The conclusion is that the strict supervision of the government supervision department has greatly increased the penalty 'cost of enterprises' failure to perform social responsibility. This helps enterprises to consciously perform social responsibility, and thus get positive comments from the public.

AB In the age of the Internet economy, Internet enterprises have attracted tremendous public attention, especially in China. In this paper, data mining through regression analysis, grey relational analysis, decision tree analysis and cluster analysis is implemented to further study the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate financial performance (CFP) of Internet enterprises in China. This study collects and analyzes data of 20 Internet enterprises in China from the year of 2011 to 2016 and draws the following conclusions: (1) the relationship between CSR and CFP of the Internet enterprises is negative; (2) from the stakeholder perspective, CSR to shareholders, creditors and government is positively related to CFP; CSR to customers, suppliers and employees is not positively related to CFP; (3) through decision tree analysis, it is found that what affects the overall CSR performance of the Internet enterprises the most is CSR to customers and suppliers, while what affects the CFP of the Internet enterprises the most is CSR to creditors; (4) through cluster analysis, 20 enterprises can be divided into three types. This study has theoretical, methodological, practical and educational implications for future related research, business practitioners and educational institutions.

AB In recent years, the technological innovation network of major engineering projects has developed rapidly in China. However, there are still some problems in the technological innovation network of major engineering projects, such as unclear responsibilities and rights among innovation subjects, and poor information communication, which make the technological innovation network of major engineering projects present low safety. The technological innovation network of major engineering projects is an alliance, and the dual governance consisting of formal contract governance and relational contract governance is an effective way to solve the alliance problem. Due to the transaction cost theory and relationship contract theory, identify the influencing factors of dual governance on the vulnerability of technological innovation network of major engineering projects through literature analysis. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the fragility of dual governance to the technological innovation network of major engineering projects. First, according to the transaction cost theory and relationship contract theory, the paper identifies the influencing factors of dual governance on the vulnerability of technological innovation network of major engineering projects. Then, using the complex network theory, a network model of influencing factors of technological innovation network vulnerability for major engineering projects is constructed, and MATLAB is used to simulate and analyze its vulnerability. The results are compared with the relevant network topology parameters, and finally the recommendations for reducing vulnerability are proposed. The findings provide a certain reference value for management and decision-making in the process of technological innovation of major engineering projects.

AB From 1982 to 2018, the Wed of Science core collection database included 2999 pieces of literature information on children's physical activity research, and data cleaning and visualization analysis was carried out by Citespace V software. The purpose is to study the international research in this field in China. The integration of the rail provides information support. The study found that: At present, the main force of foreign children's physical activity research is concentrated in the developed countries such as the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia; research focuses on "overweight and obesity, exercise behavior intervention, meditation behavior, nutrition and so on". The research evolution has gone through three stages: "exploring the foundation, expanding the extension, and comprehensively sublimating"; "in the ecosystem theory" The construction and evaluation of the nested structure model of children's physical activity is the frontier of research. The study believes that the frontier of children's physical activity research is "construction and evaluation of the nested structure model of children's physical activity in ecosystem theory."

AB With the theoretical and technical progress of Wushu education, the traditional teaching method of oral instruction and demonstration can no longer satisfy the needs of current Wushu education. To address this issue, the concept and basic characteristics of virtual reality technology were interpreted, and the effective path and challenges of applying virtual reality technology in Wushu education. The results of this study show that virtual reality technology contributes to the concrete presentation of implicit knowledge in Wushu, the construction of virtual scenes in Wushu education and the realization of a simulated self-learning system in Wushu. In the meanwhile, the application of virtual reality technology in Wushu education faces the challenges of high virtual reality equipment investment, three-dimensional modeling difficulties, huge data volume of Wushu movements and side effects after the experience of Wushu, etc.

AB The central business district is a densely populated area, compared with other evacuation modes, pedestrian evacuation is the most effective evacuation mode in case of emergency. During emergency evacuation, the pace of the crowd and the effective width of the roads are closely relevant. At present, there are differences in the setting of effective width of road in the central business district at home and abroad, and they pay more attention to the general traffic value of road, without too much research and exploration on the setting of effective width of road in emergency evacuation. In the case of limited space resources, it is increasingly important to study the effect of effective width of road on pedestrian evacuation in the central business district. Based on this, this paper conducts Research measure on the effective width of road, business center of the Three Gorges Square in Chongqing. After research measuring, it is modally analyzed according to relevant regulation. The result of the research shows that the main pedestrian road of Three Gorges Square can't meet the demands of the urgent evacuation. And when the effective width of the roads w >= 7.6 m, it can meet the demands of high-density pedestrian evacuation in commercial center.

AB This paper presents an application of a novel optimization method called Artificial Ecosystem-Based Optimization (AEO) to determine the optimal design parameters of the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for an automatic voltage regulator (AVR) system. Unlike the previous studies presented in the literature, the proposed method takes into account the excitation voltage limit and therefore formulates a new objective function for optimal PID parameters design. The practical aspect of the proposed constraint is significant since the generator field winding can be seriously damaged in case of the large excitation voltage. The performance of the proposed controller using the solution methodology proposed in this study and its contribution to the robustness of the control system are investigated. Further, the obtained PID parameters are used to simulate the AVR dynamics for a large step change in the generator's voltage set-point. Besides, the obtained step responses have been compared with the corresponding responses of the AVR system whose PID parameters are determined by using well-known methods presented in the literature. Also, the proposed AEO-PID controller shows superior performances in the case of uncertainties in the AVR system's parameters, as well as in the presence of the different disturbances in the system. The results obtained show that the obtained parameters provided a more secure and stable machine operation even with changes of the reference, generator, or excitation voltage signals compared with the performance of the controllers obtained by the previous works presented in the literature. Furthermore, AEO has proven its ability to get optimal solutions in a fast and efficient manner in terms of accuracy and time spent per iteration.

AB The main contributions of the research include the following aspects: the information index constructed by searching information on Baidu's web pages through crawler algorithm is adopted for the first time to improve the gravity model, which is then incorporated into the same framework with urban flow model and geo-economics relationship model; a new traffic accessibility model considering both passenger and freight transport is established; a comprehensive measurement index system covering seven aspects of space, industry, transportation, market and so on is constructed to quantitatively measure the development level of urban integration in Nanjing, Zhenjiang and Yangzhou from 2004 to 2016. The results show that the development trend of urban integration in the three cities is obvious and periodic during the research period. However, serious problem of industrial convergence still exists between Yangzhou and Zhenjiang and the relationship between them is a competitive geo-economics relationship. In addition, it is necessary to further integrate the factor market and enhance the sharing of infrastructure and the equalization of public services in Nanjing, Zhenjiang and Yangzhou.

AB With the rise of the tertiary industry, the financial industry has achieved unprecedented development, which is mainly reflected in the rapid growth of economic aggregate, the increasingly balanced financial structure system and the increasingly diversified financial products. However, with the rapid development of financial industry, the income of urban and rural residents is increasingly unbalanced. The increasing income gap between urban and rural areas has caused a large number of adverse phenomena in the process of economic development, seriously affecting the income distribution of the people and even causing social instability. Therefore, in today's big data era, it is necessary to systematically study and analyze the impact of financial industry development on the national income gap between urban and rural areas. At the same time, it is of great significance to improve the problem of excessive income gap between urban and rural areas. This paper mainly analyses the relationship between the three effects of the development of financial industry and the income gap between urban and rural residents. In the empirical aspect, the paper creatively uses the fuzzy Kmeans clustering algorithm to regression analysis the panel data of a certain area from 2010 to 2018. At the same time, in the empirical data analysis, this paper creatively replaces the European norm measure of the Kmeans clustering algorithm with the AE measure, and puts forward a proposal. The index of financial development level is based on the proportion of loans from financial institutions. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, this paper draws the following conclusions: the financial scale in the financial industry will have a huge impact on the income gap between urban and rural areas. Finally, based on the above problems and current situation, this paper puts forward relevant improvement suggestions.

AB Application of Remote Sensing Technology in the Development of Urban Functions is presented. Remote sensing image processing for ecological protection and monitoring, this paper proposes a remote sensing image landmark segmentation algorithm based on the IGSA and PCNN. Because the GSA algorithm has the disadvantages of premature convergence and is easy to fall into the local optimal solution, the improved IGSA algorithm is used to extract the ratio of the image entropy and energy to IGSA, and the entropy change value is used as the IGSA algorithm. Based on the global search ability of IGSA, the optimal value of the key parameters affecting the segmentation effect in PCNN model is found. Finally, through experimental comparison, the proposed method has strong advantages in segmentation effect, real-time and robustness

AB At present, some classroom teaching evaluation methods are actually difficult to reasonably and fairly evaluate teachers' true teaching level and classroom teaching quality. There are many shortcomings and drawbacks. In order to overcome the shortcomings of traditional teaching evaluation and enhance the evaluation effect, this paper combines the current advanced management methods with the merits of traditional evaluation methods, and applies the fuzzy evaluation method to combine qualitative assessment and quantitative assessment. First of all, establish a scientific and reasonable classroom teaching quality assessment index system, determine the standard assessment criteria, and then select and use the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model to evaluate the classroom teaching quality, thus establishing a complete and effective teaching quality evaluation system.

AB In most seismic design codes, usually two seismic hazard levels are taken into account, for example, Design Earthquake and Maximum Considered Earthquake. Several disastrous earthquakes have proved that seismic safety evaluation may underestimate seismic risks, which would result in serious damage of bridge structures. Therefore, a new higher level of seismic hazard named Very Rare Ground Motion (VRGM for short) is proposed innovatively to be considered in this paper for very important bridges. A novel seismic design method of simply supported girder bridges in the transverse direction for VRGMs is proposed at first. In the proposed method, seismic isolation bearings, tension-only braces and ductile piers are combined to improve the seismic performance and meet seismic requirements of VRGMs. Taking a simply supported girder bridge as a numerical analysis example, the proposed method is compared with two bridge seismic design methods adopted in current seismic codes and its parametric analysis is conducted. It's shown that the proposed seismic design method can combine the ductility capacities of piers and the functions of seismic isolation bearings and reduce all the concerned structural seismic responses in VRGMs effectively. This work provides an educational demonstration for engineers dealing with similar problems.

AB It is necessary to study fault tolerant techniques for nanotechnology since nanometer devices are very sensitive to system and environment influences. In this paper, we present a novel fault tolerant technique for nanocomputers, namely, XOR multiplexing based on redundancy-modified NAND gates. The error distributions and fault tolerant ability of the proposed architecture are analyzed and compared them with von Neumann's multiplexing. Experimental results show that compared with conventional multiplexing technique based on NAND gate, the new system has a much higher fault tolerant ability. According to the evaluation, by using multiple redundant components, the device error tolerant ability of the proposed architecture can up to the 10(-1). In unreliable nanometer-scale devices-based systems, this architecture is potentially effective against the increasing transient errors.

AB Electromagnetism forms a mandatory topic in the syllabus of undergraduate and graduate courses in electrical engineering. This topic involves many physical and mathematical concepts like curl, divergence, gradient for field determination and representation. These concepts are not only difficult to understand but also often lead to poor learning because of the imaginations and non-visualization of electric and magnetic fields. A correct understanding of fields and its distribution is necessary to understand the working, design and optimization of electrical machines. This paper presents a finite element method (FEM) based educational tool that allows the technical students to visualize electromagnetic (EM) fields inside the EM systems. This tool therefore provides a better understanding of the design and optimization of various electrical devices. This paper shows an example of a 2-pole linear machine to visualize the distribution of the magnetic field in a non-linear circuit. This machine extends to form a linear switched reluctance motor (LSRM) using step-by-step design and optimization procedure along with the user guide interface programmed in FEM based ANSYS Maxwell software. This motor is used as an example to visualize magnetic fields using FEM software in complex circuits and can be used as a good educational tool for students. The paper incorporates the validation of the design procedure through FEM simulations.

AB A laboratory setup is developed to experimentally reinforce the student's understanding of multilevel neutral point clamped inverter operated with various multicarrier and modulation reference signals. Sixteen combinations of carrier and reference signals out of many more possible are studied in this setup. The lab module is project-based and is designed to perform experiments for the 'advanced power electronics and drives' course at the undergraduate level. The hardware implementation details of the multilevel inverter are given in detail for reference to the teachers, students and researchers. Flexible hardware able to be driven by an analogue pulse-generation circuit is explained here or by an external digital programmable device is developed. With the help of dSPACE, complex reference signals are produced for performance analysis.

AB Nowadays, deep learning technique becomes the most popular fast-growing machine learning method in an Artificial Neural Network. The Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is one of the deep learning architecture that has been applied in the field of image analysis and image classification. In this paper, we proposed a novel emotion learning model with a deep learning network. The aim of the learning model is to reduce the affective gap, that extracts the objects and background features of an image semantically, such as high-level and low-level features. These extracted features accompanied with few others and it is more effective in emotion prediction model based on visual concepts of image, that leads to better emotion recognition performance. For training and testing, the experiment is conducted on IAPS (International Affective Picture System) dataset, the Artistic Photos, and the Emotion-Image dataset. An experimental result shows that the proposed model combines visual-content and low-level features of the image that provides promising results for Affective Emotion Classification task.

AB Harmonics in supply voltage or load current in a transformer have undesirable effects on the core and windings. As the harmonic content increases, higher core loss and eddy current loss in the windings results in higher operating temperatures. It causes magnetic flux density in the core to increase and shifts the operating point through the saturated region. This phenomenon is mostly taught in undergraduate education as theoretical information. However, as a difficult concept to understand, harmonics phenomenon might be taught by using experiments for active learning, visualizing the effects in a laboratory setting, and making the connection between theoretical and practical applications for deeper and meaningful learning. In this study, a teaching method for effects of harmonics is proposed and phase shift between the fundamental and harmonic component of the supply voltage on the transformer B-H characteristic in a laboratory application is introduced by an experimental work performed on toroidal transformers. Feedback from students shows that the proposed method is very efficient and useful for students to better understand the effects of harmonics on the transformer cores.

AB The study of electric vehicle and its energy sources are being incorporated in undergraduate and postgraduate syllabuses. This article discusses the basic concepts and design of energy storage systems for electricity based transpiration application. The content of this work elaborates the importance of energy storage systems in electric vehicle and hybridization of energy storage systems i.e. battery and ultracapacitor, which seems to be a promising topic among the final-year project students as well as an emerging research topic among the research scholars worldwide. Hence, this article is prepared in order to trigger those students' knowledge in multisourced electric vehicle in depth. This study highly focuses on fuzzy logic-based energy sources power split strategy for a multisourced electric vehicle to enhance a better sharing of energy across the multisources with distinct characteristics like high specific power (ultracapacitor) and high specific energy (battery). In general, fuzzy logic controller best suits for a complicated real-time problem. Further it does not require a priori knowledge of a vehicle driving pattern over a time. Hence, the proposed control strategy can provide a satisfactory improvement in vehicle efficiency, assured reduction in stress factor, and energy consumption rate and reduced ultracapacitor sources state of charge difference in all different hybridization topologies. Thus, this paper can help students working on energy management problems of hybridization of energy sources.

AB A three-phase synchronous machine was, and still is, one of the most important element in today's power generation systems (operating as a generator) or in distribution-load systems (operating as a motor). Thus, a suitable and detailed model is required to be used by students and future engineers in order to deal with transient stability analyses. For this purpose, the paper presents and analyses a procedure by which the mathematical modelling of a three-phase, four-pole, synchronous machine can be implemented in theLabVIEWenvironment. A suitable graphics user interface is proposed and case studies under different machine operating conditions are shown. The corresponding results illustrate the validity and accuracy of the model. Furthermore, a reactive power PI controller is also implemented. The overall graphics user interface/simulation model is applied to an undergraduate course as a teaching tool and assessed thoroughly. It is shown that the proposed tool may be utilized in under/post-graduate studies as well as in power utilities practician engineers courses.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION

DE Finite element method; inductance; learning performance; simulation
ID FORMULAS
AB This article analyzes the inductance of different conductive nonmagnetic conductors' configurations under alternating current supply. The inductance is a key design parameter in tracks of electronic devices, power transmission and distribution systems, and lightning, grounding, and bonding systems. Inductance highly relies on the problem geometry, and under AC supply, it is also influenced by skin and proximity effects. The inductance significantly determines voltage drop in conductors, thus increasing reactive power consumption and limiting conductors' ampacity. Although this is an important topic, it is seldom studied in detail in undergraduate and even in graduate physics and engineering studies. To this end, this paper compares the results provided by existing closed formulas for simple conductors' configurations with those attained through two-dimensional finite element method simulations. Finite element method based simulations are increasingly being incorporated in the syllabuses of graduate and undergraduate courses due to their accurate solutions and flexibility, since finite element method models can be applied in a wide range of electrical frequencies and configurations, some of which do not have an analytical solution. The finite element method based approach presented in this paper has been found a valuable complement to the lectures and assignments in electricity courses for engineering students.

ID DAMAGE
AB Gearboxes are the important components in process industries such as cement, food processing and rubber. Pitting is the removal of the material in certain part of gear by the application of repeated stresses. Tooth pitting and surface failure occur due to excessive stress conditions. When a number of pits join together, a larger pit is formed, referred as a spall, which may lead to tooth breakage. The early detection and diagnosis of excessive wear tooth pitting and spalling in gear transmission systems are becoming significant concerns in high-speed, large power applications. The early detection of pitting in gears is important from condition monitoring point of view, which is still to be addressed by an experimental approach. In this study, vibration characteristics of a single-stage spur gearbox with pitting as seeded faults are investigated.

AB Based on the total cost theory of international trade, this article analyzes the mechanism of trade facilitation to agricultural products export, tests the actual promotion effect of trade facilitation to export of Chinese agricultural products by the United States, Japan, South Korea and 28 EU countries based on the extended gravity model. The project is designed by students and teachers .The research shows that the reduction of cross-border time has a positive effect on China's agricultural products export, but the promoting effect is weakened by the negative impact of technical trade measures for agricultural products. Further research shows that the effect of cross-border time reduction on Chinese agricultural products export is heterogeneous. Due to the negative impact of technical trade measures for agricultural products, the cross-border time reduction in developed countries has a strong role in promoting China's agricultural exports; while the cross-border time reduction in non-developed countries has no significant role to promote Chinese agricultural products export, and the technical trade measures involving agricultural product have no inhibiting effect on the promotion of cross-border time reduction. The empirical test also proves the effectiveness of the above research project. Therefore, for the aim to strengthen the export of Chinese agricultural products to the above-mentioned countries, China should not only take advantage of the positive impact of trade facilitation, but also effectively resolve the negative impact of technical trade measures for agricultural products. At the end of this paper, some suggestions and countermeasures are put forward.

ID CHAIN
AB This paper analyzed how consumer brand loyalty influences brand remanufacturers' market strategy when independent remanufacturers (IRs) enter the market and when they do not. The authors developed and analyzed four market models, "no IR enter and no brand remanufacture (n)," "no IR enter and brand remanufacture (nR)," "IR enter and no brand manufacture (nr)," and "IR enter and brand remanufacture (nrR)". They then analyzed the results using sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis. The research found that new product prices, brand remanufactured product prices, and general re-product prices are positively correlated with brand loyalty; with the increasing level of brand loyalty, brand manufacturers' profit increases, while the IR's profit is lowered. Further, when the manufacturing costs of new products are high, the model preference for the brand manufacturers is always nR > nrR > n > nr; when the costs are lower, the level of the consumer brand loyalty affects the model preference. In models nr and nrR, brand loyalty may increase the brand consumer surplus, but reduces the average consumer surplus, total consumer surplus, and total social welfare.

AB Frequent NIMBY conflicts have seriously affected social stability and urban development. This paper aims to explore the psychosocial path of people participating in the collective action of NIMBY conflict, and to provide theoretical basis for effective governance of NIMBY conflict. By integrating the psychosocial explanatory variables related to collective action, we construct a regulated double mediation Model, which is empirically tested with 566 questionnaires from the NIMBY conflict in gaoling, China. The results show that: group relative deprivation, group emotions and group effectiveness have positive effects on people's NIMBY conflict participation tendency; group effectiveness and group emotions are important mediating variables of group relative deprivation affecting people's NIMBY conflict participation tendency; group identity has a positive adjustment effect on people's group emotions, group effectiveness, and the participation tendency of NIMBY conflict. The research indicates that group relative deprivation is the key precursor of NIMBY conflict, group emotion is the key factor driving the deterioration of NIMBY conflict, and group identity is the key factor catalyzing the occurrence of NIMBY conflict. This study helps to explain the psychological mechanism of people's participation in NIMBY conflict, and has certain implications for the prevention and governance of NIMBY conflict.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Rural land transfer; part-time farmers; feasible capacity theory;
   multi-dimensional welfare measurement
AB The premise of promoting the sustainable development of rural land transfer is that rural land transfer can improve the welfare level of farmers. Based on Amartya Sen's theory of capability, this paper selects part-time farmers' six welfare functional activities after rural land transfer, including family economic status, social security, health and leisure, social demand, psychological condition and occupational status. A multidimensional welfare measure model of having uneven distribution sensitive and satisfying "Subgroup Conformance" and "path independence" is used to measure the part-time farmers' welfare changes after rural land transfer. The results show that the comprehensive welfare level of part-time farmers has improved before and after rural land transfer. From the sub dimension index, the welfare level of family economic situation, psychological condition and occupational status has increased obviously, the change of social security welfare level is not significant, the welfare level of health and leisure and social demand has declined, and the welfare loss of various dimensions is increased, which indicates that the welfare distribution of part-time farmers after rural land transfer is more unbalanced. Therefore, it is suggested that the welfare level of the part-time farmers can be improved by improving the rural social security, increasing the training of farmers' employment knowledge, and providing non-agricultural employment opportunities, thus promoting the sustainable development of rural land transfer.

AB based on the theory of enterprise competition and cooperation, combined with the characteristics of the organizational structure of logistics park enterprises, based on the previous research on the factors of enterprise competition and cooperation in logistics park, this paper constructs a conceptual model of enterprise competition and cooperation influence factors in logistics park. Based on the internal influence factors of the enterprise and the external influence factors of the logistics park, four internal influence factors and three external influence factors are put forward, and the factors that affect the competition and cooperation of logistics park enterprises are analyzed by factor analysis method. The results show that the factors related to the survival of competing and cooperating enterprises in logistics parks such as enterprise cooperative preference, enterprise niche, structure and location of logistics parks have a high impact on the competition and cooperation of enterprises in logistics parks. Secondly, the motivation factors of competing and cooperating enterprises such as the pressure of enterprise competition, the speed of enterprise growth, and the environmental capacity affect the competition and cooperation of enterprises in logistics parks, and finally the impact of the punishment mechanism on the competition and cooperation of enterprises in logistics parks.

AB To explore the influence of grid connected electric vehicle on microgrid and its collaborative control under the background of new energy power generation, in this study, the constraints of electric vehicle are established from two aspects of electric vehicle travel characteristics and battery charging and discharging characteristics. In view of the variety of controllable resources in microgrid, multi-agent microgrid coordination control architecture is used to control the multi-layer coordination of microgrid, and simulation is built to analyze four different scenes. The results show that in the microgrid load, it is found that the valley peak difference is the smallest when both the electric vehicle and the conventional load participate in the demand response (scene 4). In the change of SOC and charge discharge power of battery energy storage system, it is found that four scenes make the energy storage function of "low storage and high generation" play an effective role. In the economic and environmental benefits of microgrid daily operation, it is found that the daily operation cost and environmental benefits of scene 4 are significantly lower than that of scene 1. Therefore, in this study, the coordinated optimization method of integrating electric vehicle into microgrid based on multi-agent microgrid can effectively solve the coordinated optimization of multi controllable resources of microgrid, and provide experimental basis for the subsequent development and optimization of microgrid.

AB The objective is to predict and analyze the behaviors of users in the social network platform by using the personality theory and computational technologies, thereby acquiring the personality characteristics of social network users more effectively. First, social network data are analyzed, which finds that the type of text data marks the majority. By using data mining technology, the raw data of numerous social network users can be obtained. Based on the random walk model, the data information of the text status of social network users is analyzed, and a user personality prediction method integrating multi-label learning is proposed. In addition, the online social network platform Weibo is taken as the research object. The blog information of Weibo users is obtained through crawler technology. Then, the users are labeled in accordance with personality characteristics. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used to evaluate the relation between the user personality characteristics and the user behavior characteristics of the Weibo users. The correlation between the network behaviors and personality characteristics of Weibo users is analyzed, and the scientificity of the prediction method is verified by the Big Five Model of Personality. By applying relevant technologies and algorithms of data mining and deep learning, the learning ability of neural networks on data characteristics can be improved. In terms of performance on analyzing text information of social network users, the user personality prediction method of integrated multi-label learning based on the random walk model has a large advantage. For the problem of personality prediction of social network users, through combining data mining technology and deep neural network technology in deep learning, the data processing results of social network user behaviors are more accurate.

AB Based on the data from China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS) and the exploratory factor analysis in SPSS19 software, the paper built a structural equation model in AMOS17 software to perform first- and second-order confirmatory factor analysis on parents' marital quality. And then discussed how parents' marital quality influence their young children's benefits in career and family through the relation between neighbors, the childhood of their children and the children's happiness level in childhood. The results are as follows. The direct influence of parents' marital quality on their young children's benefit is -0.06, which indirectly proved that parents' marital quality in China is still low compared with some other countries. However, the combined impact influence of parents' marital quality on their young children's benefit is 0.013 and the indirect influence of parents' marital quality on their young children's benefit through the childhood of their children is 0.088, which is an evidence that parents' marital quality has a extended and combined influence on their young children's benefit.

   behaviour prediction; Scikit-learn
AB Nowadays, with the improvement in people's quality of life, more and more people choose to travel abroad in leisure time. Therefore, the great difference in lifestyles could cause culture shock, which make tourists' trip a relative awful experience, especially in the popular resorts of some countries such as Europe and America, where tips are given whenever there is a service being provided, and this behaviour confused lots of tourists from Asia, Africa or even European countries. Based on decision tree, this study aimed to share troubles of those tourists with needs by taking the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission's database as research's target, thereby analysing factors that may cause variation in tipping rates. Finally, it is found that distance and duration contributed most to trip fare. Also, besides accurately predicting the tip amount, how each factor contributes to the trip needs to be known; thus, linear regression is used to check the validity of the result, and a 14.1% rate of all distance as a fee is achieved. This study provides a model - which can also be used in many different places - that tremendously improve people's quality of life, and the main idea is relative to the fuzzy system in solving social problems.

AB With the growing complexity of the human living environment, the environment-related industries have also been flourishing. Clustering of environmental data is a key task of environment research. The environmental data are characterized by diversification, boundary fuzzification, incompleteness, etc. This paper conducts a cluster analysis of environmental data based on fuzzy theory. To start with, the basic principle of fuzzy theory is analyzed, and the focus is on studying the membership function and the lambda-cut-set knowledge. Following that, the fuzzy clustering method and its process are studied. Finally, fuzzy evaluation is used to build the membership function after experiment on the MATLAB platform to evaluate the environmental quality. The fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm is used to realize the target identification of environmental data. In the process of fuzzy clustering, fuzzy evaluation of the seawater quality is realized, and the redundant data of the monitoring station are removed. Through experiment and analysis, experimental results are in line with the practical situations and show a high consistency with the data characteristics. Compared with the traditional clustering algorithm, fuzzy clustering is more suitable for environmental data processing in environmental data research and analysis.

AB Vegetation concrete is a typical artificial composite soil commonly used for ecological restoration on slopes. The strength and stability of vegetation concrete would be reduced when it is used in areas where freeze-thaw cycles occur frequently. For exploring the changes of structural properties of vegetation concrete under freeze-thaw cycles, an indoor simulation experiment of vegetation concrete samples containing 25 and 30% water content was carried out, so as to test the changes of specimen surface, volume, ultrasonic wave velocity, shearing strength, and microscopic structure. The microstructural parameters were analyzed quantitatively with Image-Pro Plus software. The experimental results indicated that as cycles of freeze-thaw grow, the macroscopic changes of samples included steadily rising surface crack rate, increasing first and then decreasing volume, greatly reducing ultrasonic wave velocity and gradually decreasing shear strength. The inner structure of samples slowly deteriorated from overall dense to dispersed with decreasing cement hydration crystals, pores resulting from dispersion and destruction of bulky grains, higher surface porosity, and smoother particles in microscopic aspect. When compared with samples containing 25% water content, the microstructure of the 30% water content sample was more affected by the freeze-thaw cycle, and its structural weakening effect was more obvious. Reduced cement hydration crystals, lower inter-particle bonding force, and increase in the number of large pores were the main causes of degradation of vegetation concrete structure. Electrical engineering students can refer to the analysis methods in this paper to evaluate the structural performance of any electrical engineering material.

AB The increasing penetration of distributed generators may harm power system and its control and operations. The microgrid offers a better solution for the issues in grid operation. Undergraduate electrical engineering and postgraduate power system and power electronics students need to understand the working of microgrid with renewable energy resources along with the optimization and scheduling of power quality custom power devices. To cater better understanding of the microgrid with renewable resources, wind, solar, distributed generators, distributed energy storage devices, DSTATCOM, and plug-in electric vehicle charging load are included in this work presented. In this paper, multiobjective optimization for the operation of microgrid to account for uncertainties in a stochastic energy resources management system is considered. Nonlinear constraint optimization to reduce the running cost, losses, and voltage variations is focused for the optimization. Loss sensitivity analysis is used to find the location wind, solar, distributed generators, distributed energy storage devices, and DSTATCOM. Firefly algorithm is used to optimize the size of distributed generators and DSTATCOM. Optimization reduced the loss, power taken from the grid and improves the voltages in the system. This paper is self-explanatory to the undergraduate and postgraduate students to understand the power flow analysis of microgrid with hybrid renewable energies and optimization technique.

AB The non-line of sight (NLOS) propagation caused by the building shielding and background interference will lead to large error when applying Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology to indoor positioning. In order to reduce the positioning error, a joint simulated annealing algorithm and a bat algorithm is proposed in the paper. First, based on the Bat Algorithm (BA), transform the problem of the target into the problem of difference between the estimated position and the actual position to establish an iterative optimization model. Then introduce random perturbation factor to improve the search ability of the bat individual; Aiming at BA is easy to fall into local optimum, a Simulate Anneal (SA) algorithm is integrated to improve the classification and search ability of the algorithm. Finally, we use Chan-Taylor algorithm to determine the accurate position of the target. The research result shows that proposed algorithm improves positioning accuracy by 11 similar to 23cm which can effectively improve the positioning accuracy of the positioning algorithm under the LOS/NLOS environment.

AB With the emerging technology of remote sensing, a huge amount of remote sensing data is collected and stored in the remote sensin02222g platform, and the transmission and processing of data on the platform is extremely wasteful. It is essential to incorporate the speedy remote sensing processing services in an integrated cloud computing architecture. In order to improve the denoising ability of remote sensing image, a new structured dictionary-based method for multispectral image denoising based on cluster is proposed. This method incorporates both the locality of spatial and the correlation across spectrum of multispectral image. Remote sensing image is divided into different groups by clustering, and sparse representation coefficients of spatial and spectral and dictionary is obtained according to the dictionary learning algorithm. After threshold processing, the similar blocks are averaged and realized with multispectral remote sensing image denoising. The algorithm is applied to denoise the noisy remote sensing image of Maoergai area in the upper Minjiang which contain typical vegetation and soil is chosen as study area, simulation results show that higher peak-signal to noise ratio can be obtained as compared to other recent image denoising methods.

AB To explore the design of the virtual reality (VR) augmented reality (AR) mobile platform and game decision model based on deep learning (DL), the gesture-based interaction of VR games based on Leap Motion is researched. Based on the interactive features of gestures, a set of general gesture interaction rules in VR games is established. In the meantime, according to the theoretical basis and the characteristics of VR, a set of general models of VR gesture interaction is designed, the factors affecting the efficiency of VR gesture interaction are studied, and reasonable interaction feedback is designed. By using the computer vision and image processing technology, gesture-based interaction can collect natural gestures, extract gesture features, recognize gesture indications, and respond to the user demands. Also, it can extract the basic gestures from gesture-based interaction in VR, analyze the basic features of gestures and gesture-based interaction in VR games, and describes the gesture features by mathematical vectors and sets. The research results show that the application of gesture feature design method in the game can analyze the factors affecting the interaction efficiency. Also, the usability of the gesture-based interaction designed by the gesture design method is verified by tests. Therefore, the AR&DL platform of "AR+DL" establishes a learning platform supported by DL and AR technology. The game decision model is used to describe the process of gesture-based interaction in the game, and the factors affecting the interaction efficiency are reduced, which has certain reference and guidance for VR applications using gesture-based interaction.

AB In this paper, we propose a deep learning based smoke detection method which overcomes drawbacks of the conventional smoke detection method. Real-time smoke detection via machine-based identification method in the area of surveillance system has been of great advantage in recent era. An effective smoke detection strategy is necessary to avoid the hazard resulting from fire. The conventional smoke detection method lacks in accuracy, therefore, deep learning based smoke detection is adopted for the same purpose. However, a lot of video smoke detection approach involves minimum lighting and it can be required for the cameras to discover the existence of smoke particles in a scene. Eliminating such challenges, our proposed work introduces a novel concept like hybrid reinforcement deep Q learning classifier of smoke detection. This work takes the correct decision about the smoke particles via reinforcement deep Q learning and classifies the smoke particle with the deep convolutional neural network. The proposed real-time algorithm is aimed to provide proper education for the engineers to detect moving objects for the purpose of developing surveillance systems. This method is also helpful for the beginners who have keen interest in the field of deep learning to control fire. Here, to observe the temporal variance of fire smoke, spatial analysis is identified in the present frame and in the subsequence of the video, spatio-temporal analysis has been taken into account. Finally, smoke particles are classified with the novel reinforcement Q learning-based classifier and experimental results show a better performance regarding classification accuracy. So we can detect smoke successfully with the novel method. The main purpose of this work is to describe and formalize a machine learning -based smoke detection algorithm that can be used by students.

AB The 3D integrated circuits are enlarging the technology with lots of potentials which establish vertical interconnection between different dies or layers. In 3D-integrated circuit fabrication, congestion, and wirelength minimization are challenging processes. To overcome these problems, we proposed a novel optimization approach for useful partitioning, placement, and routing. Our proposed work consists of four significant stages, including partitioning, placement, routing, and fault diagnosis in through silicon via and spare through silicon via allocation. Firstly, the QuadTree partitioning method executed by the partitioning process. QuadTree method partitions the layer into four subdivisions and remains until it finds no space for partitioning. AND logic is proposed to overcome the congestion problem during placement. In the second stage, the functioning of the hybrid particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing algorithm proposed by the placement process. Particle swarm optimization computes fitness function for six constraints, specifically wirelength, area, power, cross talk, temperature, and delay. The simulated annealing places circuits in the specified area with the computed fitness function. In every 45 degrees, Kruskal's based octi-linear Steiner tree algorithm that establishes routes performs the routing by the third stage. In the last stage, fault detection in through silicon via and spare through silicon via allocation processes are executed using the support vector machine algorithm and dedicated switch. Support vector machine classifies the TSV into two, which includes regular and redundant through silicon via. The spare through silicon via allocation performed by using a dedicated switch. Finally, the proposed work evaluated based on metrics such as wire length, area, temperature, delay, and run time.

AB Based on the data of 31 provinces in China from 2007 to 2017, this paper adopts the panel vector autoregression model to study the dynamic relationship between meteorological science and technology capabilities and the economic development of meteorologically sensitive industries. Research results suggest that the effect of meteorological S&T on the economic development of sensitive industries related to meteorology is not remarkable, but the later plays a positive role in promoting the former. This means there is a certain relationship between them, but the interactive effect is weak. What's more, further research finds they cannot bring their coordination capability into fuller play and cannot achieve mutual promotion theoretically.

AB The sedimentary rock masses are commonly seen in underground engineering, and it is a threat to the safety of underground constructions greatly. Bolt supporting reinforcement works effectively in enhancing the rock in underground engineering. In this study, the roofs made of the horizontally layered rock were simplified to the rock plate structure with two different constrains, and a cusp catastrophe model was established based on the structural mechanics. With the application of the developed cusp catastrophe model, the influences of ratio of span to thickness, the amounts, and the preload of the bolts on the stability of the stratified rock were studied. Findings show that the installation of bolts can increase the anti-bulking capacity of the layered rock. The bolts can change the failure of the layered rock from bulking failure to shear failure. Improving the integrity of the layered rock is also helpful for enhancing the resistance to the bulking instability.

AB This research presents a web-based lighting laboratory infrastructure that allows students to access and control application tools in lighting technology education through online real-time equipment. Designed for Distance Vocational Training and Education, this system uses the LabVIEW Virtual Instrumentation Program to control lighting levels. In this program, the interface developed allows students to control and monitor applications online using cameras, sensors, and controllers. In the modeled system, the lighting levels of LED lamps are controlled through PID controllers. Furthermore, a web page was designed that provides synchronized (simultaneous) access to application instrumentation for the students. Each user can run applications in a specific period through this website. Students can also monitor the lighting level of the laboratory in real-time with a webcam. Individual storage of the data obtained in the model also supports conducting necessary analyses. Students can strengthen their theoretical knowledge by running lighting technique experiment applications with real equipment in the Distance Vocational Training and Education. In the evaluation part of the research, the answers are given by the students (95%) also stated that they increased the theoretical knowledge of doing remote experiments. In total 98.5% of students believe that the ability to repeat experiments anywhere in this system will accelerate the learning process.

AB This work analyses the load-frequency responses of a multi-unit based two-area power system by proposing a novel cascaded fuzzy Proportional Derivative-Proportional Integral (PD-PI) controller tuned with a recently proposed grasshopper optimization algorithm. Performance of the power system comprising of conventional sources like hydro and thermal generating units is evaluated by cascaded fuzzy PD-PI controller optimised by grasshopper optimization algorithm. The potential of grasshopper optimization algorithm is validated by comparing with other algorithms. Further, load-frequency response is studied by penetrating solar-thermal and wind power generating units into the recommended system. The power system integrated with renewable sources puts forth a great stability challenge in the wake of high load perturbation. Hence, a robust secondary controller named cascaded fuzzy PD-PI controller is designed by endorsing a profound grasshopper optimization algorithm technique, to tackle this stability challenge. The credibility of the cascaded fuzzy PD-PI controller with/without nonlinearities presented in the system is validated by comparing the results obtained from proportional-integral-derivative and fuzzy-proportional-integral-derivative controllers. Besides this, the performance of the system under highly perturbed step load variation confers the robustness of the proposed method.

AB The lack of consumer trust in green residences is an important reason why the green residential market is difficult to promote. According to the consumer theory and trust building model, structural equation model (SEM) of the factors affecting the trust of green residences is established. According to the questionnaire of 368 consumers in Xi'an, China, the reliability and validity of the original data are analyzed by SPSS data analysis software, and SEM model is processed by AMOS analysis software to obtain the key influencing factors of consumer trust in green residences. The results show that individual characteristics, green residential knowledge, green residential information, environmental responsibility awareness, perceived value, and institutional evaluation are important factors influencing consumer trust. Individual characteristics, environmental responsibility awareness, and institutional evaluation significantly positively affect consumer trust at the 1% level; green residential knowledge and green residential information significantly positively affect consumer trust at the 5% level; perceived value negatively affects consumer trust at the 1% level. The research results can provide an important reference for enhancing consumer trust and promoting the green residences.

AB Renewable energy sources are replacing other energy sources to minimize the cost of due to the conventional sources of energy. Solar and wind are readily available sources which will minimize the cost of electricity if implemented properly. Considering the weather and other relevant advantages, solar energy is a favorable option for a particular site. But it is extremely difficult for the implementation of the suggested renewable energy in a site which already has specific resources and existing infrastructure to replace. Several factors should be counted in for the selection and implementation of appropriate renewable source for fulfilling the demand. As a possible energy option, on-grid infrastructure is selected looking at its low necessity of development and hardware cost. This paper aims to impart the detailed designs of alternative energy options that will offset the annual irrigation costs of the Rainbow Youth Golf Education Program in Klamath County. Using simulator, a practical modeling of the system is performed to look at the cost associated with each case. After selecting a combination with the minimum cost, it is shown that the model decreases the irrigation cost compared to previous year. Other technological implications are also evaluated. Finally, worst case scenario is modeled using the simulator to show that even in the bad weather, the site's energy supply model serves well both electrically and economically.

AB In this research, Dunhuang murals is taken as the object of restoration, and the role of digital repair combined with deep learning algorithm in mural restoration is explored. First, the image restoration technology is described, as well as its advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. Second, the deep learning algorithm based on artificial neural network is described and analyzed. Finally, the deep learning algorithm is integrated into the digital repair technology, and a mural restoration method based on the generalized regression neural network is proposed. The morphological expansion method and anisotropic diffusion method are used to preprocess the image. The MATLAB software is used for the simulation analysis and evaluation of the image restoration effect. The results show that in the restoration of the original image, the accuracy of the digital image restoration technology is not high. The nontexture restoration technology is not applicable in the repair of large-scale texture areas. The predicted value of the mural restoration effect based on the generalized neural network is closer to the true value. The anisotropic diffusion method has a significant effect on the processing of image noise. In the image similarity rate, the different number of training samples and smoothing parameters are compared and analyzed. It is found that when the value of delta is small, the number of training samples should be increased to improve the accuracy of the prediction value. If the number of training samples is small, a larger value of delta is needed to get a better prediction effect, and the best restoration effect is obtained for the restored image. Through this study, it is found that this study has a good effect on the restoration model of Dunhuang murals. It provides experimental reference for the restoration of later murals.

AB One of the most significant issues arising from the intermittency of renewable sources is the discrepancy between the hours of peak generation and hours of peak load. This issue complicates the process of supply and demand balancing because the electrical energy generated by photovoltaic arrays cannot be directly stored. Energy storage systems provide a solution to this issue by storing the excess energy generated during peak generation time which will be delivered to the grid during peak load, increasing system energy efficiency. In this work, the possibility of utilizing a Megawatt scale energy storage system, such as a battery bank, to improve the efficiency of a proposed 10-MW Biglow Canyon solar array through solar peak shaving is discussed in detail. With an overview of the benefits of peak shaving and a comparative study of energy storage technologies, an assessment of the most suitable commercially available storage systems is broadly discussed in the paper. Three control algorithms based on battery storage, state of charge, and constant output are proposed to balance the difference between generation and usage using appropriate energy storage system. Simulations are performed with System Advisor Model software to gain an insight of the possible losses and to forecast the monthly energy production costs.

AB Renewable energy sources are becoming a popular choice of energy, due to their sundry advantages and more convenient environmental impacts. Wind certainly emerges as one of the most plausible energy sources in modern power generation. However, large-scale wind energy is associated with fluctuations in voltage and power due to its intermittent nature. The proposed pumped hydroelectric energy storage system offers one of the best solutions in solving this problem. It is shown that large-scale integration of wind energy becomes more feasible and efficient when a proper energy storage system is added to achieve appropriate energy charging or discharging. Upon comparing the potential of different storage systems, pumped hydroelectric energy storage is found to be highly promising for wind integration. In order to demonstrate the behavior of the integrated system with respect to time constant and to verify the feasibility of the energy storage in different case studies, simulations are performed in Matlab/Simulink. This work would open new doors toward the investigation of large-scale wind power integration. It is also expected that pumped hydroelectric energy storage would become a possible alternative for energy reserves for large-scale wind power applications.

AB Smart city has become an important direction of urban development. Focusing on the construction of smart city, it can reflect the ideal practical effect in many aspects, effectively improve the level of urban development and operation, and also show better in urban planning. Strong influence requires urban planning for adaptive adjustment. This paper from the core of a small wind power system is the grid-connected inverter. According to the main topology of small wind power generation inverter and grid-connected system, a systematic modeling of small wind power generation system is built. In order to make up for the deficiency of the traditional control strategy for small wind power grid-connected inverter, this paper puts forward a fuzzy control and quasi-PR control method to be applied to the synchronization control of grid-connected inverter. The simulation experiment is conducted by using MATLAB/SIMULINK platform, and the test is conducted by means of combining self-designed system hardware circuit, and the results show that compared with the PR method, the grid current synchronization error can be reduced to smaller, adaptability, and anti-disturbance can be greatly improved through the proposed method and, consequently, has a better application value for small wind power grid-connected inverter.

AB The emergence of building information modeling technology has facilitated promotion and application of integrated project delivery mode, while reasonable allocation of control right is the key to dealing with opportunistic behavior during the knowledge sharing process of the building information modeling-integrated project delivery project. Replicator dynamics model from the perspective of knowledge sharing was established by means of evolutionary game, to analyze the evolutionarily stability strategy for allocation of control right between the owners and the professional technology companies. The research showed that, when the knowledge sharing benefit from innovation was more than the supervision cost for struggling for control right, two stably revolutionary strategies existed in the game system, namely contingent control and joint control; and the stably revolutionary status was under the influence of knowledge synergy coefficient, proportion of complementary knowledge, knowledge stock, degree of knowledge sharing, probability that the estimated operation status of the project was favorable, supervision cost, success probability of the project, etc. The research results provided a theoretical reference for the owners and the professional technology companies of building information modeling-integrated project delivery project in deciding whether to struggle for control right or not according to the observed information and the final benefit level.

AB Hotel social media provides access to dissatisfied customers and their experiences with services. However, due to massive topics and posts in social media, and the sparse distribution of complaint-related posts and, manually identifying complaints is inefficient and time-consuming. In this study, we propose a supervised learning method including training samples enlargement and classifier construction. We first identified reliable complaint and noncomplaint samples from the unlabeled dataset by using small labeled samples as training samples. Combining the labeled samples and enlarged samples, classification algorithms support vector machine and k-nearest neighbor were then adopted to build binary classifiers during the classifier construction process. Experimental results indicate the proposed method can identify complaints from social media efficiently, especially when the amount of labeled training samples is small. This study provides an efficient approach for hotel companies to distinguish a certain kind of consumer complaint information from large number of unrelated information in hotel social media.

AB Sentiment analysis becomes one of the most active research hotspots in the field of natural language processing tasks in recent years. However, the inability to fully and effectively use emotional information is a problem in present deep learning models. A single Chinese character has different meanings in different words, and the character embeddings are combined with the word embeddings to extract more precise meaning information. In this paper, a single Chinese character and word are used as input units to train. Based on BLSTM, the attention mechanism based on vocabulary semantics in food field is introduced to realize distance-related sequence semantic feature extraction. CNN is used to realize semantic sentiment classification of sequence semantic features. Therefore, a model based on multi-neural network for sentiment information extraction and analysis is proposed. Experiments show that the model has excellent characteristics in sentiment analysis and obtains high accuracy and F value.

AB The paper proposes a t-norm-based matching score fusion approach for a multimodal heterogenous biometric recognition system. Two trait-based multimodal recognition system is developed by using biometrics traits like palmprint and face. First, palmprint and face are pre-processed, extracted features and calculated matching score of each trait using correlation coefficient and combine matching scores using t-norm based score level fusion. Face database like Face 94, Face 95, Face 96, FERET, FRGC and palmprint database like IITD are operated for training and testing of algorithm. The results of experimentation show that the proposed algorithm provides the Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR) of 99.7% at False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.1% and GAR of 99.2% at FAR of 0.01% significantly improves the accuracy of a biometric recognition system. The proposed algorithm provides the 0.53% more accuracy at FAR of 0.1% and 2.77% more accuracy at FAR of 0.01%, when compared to existing works.

   improved ELECTRE method
AB Good extracurricular activities can optimize the quality of education, fetch up with classroom education and teach them what they cannot learn from it, is conducive to improve students' comprehensive quality, to complete the task and achieve the goal of university education. For this reason, this paper proposes an extracurricular sports lifestyle evaluation to college students via an improved ELECTRE method. In the proposed method, three indexes - concordance index, non-concordance index and credibility index - are defined first. Based on these indexes, the preference evaluation matrix is constructed, and consistent credibility, non-consistent credibility and net credibility are computed second. Third, it was sorted for the quality of all alternatives according to the value of group net credibility. In general, the greater the value of the group net credibility of a project, the better the project is. Simulation experiments suggest that this proposed method is feasible and valid. Extracurricular activities for college students take a very important part of university education, and it models their characters, opens up their minds, adventure spirits, strengthens their social connections, improve their comprehensive quality and their personal positive socialization.

AB The emergence of prefabricated buildings is helpful to solve the problems of serious energy consumption and environmental pollution in traditional cast-in-place buildings. However, the current unclear benefits of prefabricated buildings have led to great constraints on its development in China. Therefore, in order to clarify the comprehensive benefit level of prefabricated buildings and promote the development of prefabricated buildings, the comprehensive benefits of prefabricated buildings are analyzed from four aspects of economy, environment, society, and security, and 19 evaluation indexes of economic benefits, environmental benefits, social benefits, and safety benefits of prefabricated buildings are selected from the life cycle dimension in this paper. The comprehensive benefits of prefabricated buildings are constructed by using set pair analysis theory. Finally, through the analysis of the prefabricated building project in Hefei, the feasibility of the model was verified, and comprehensive benefit level of prefabricated buildings in Hefei was further judged. This paper provides a feasible and operable evaluation model for the comprehensive benefit evaluation of prefabricated buildings and also provides a theoretical support for the development of prefabricated buildings.

ID DETERMINANTS
AB From the practice of developed countries, countries with higher patent applications and PCT patent applications (such as the United States, China, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, etc.) have relatively higher outward foreign direct investment, and the actual data of provinces in China also show that with the improvement of the patent level in various provinces and cities, the intensity of outward foreign direct investment in each province and city has also increased. At present, there are relatively few research data and the research method is relatively single. Therefore, collecting panel data on China's 31 provinces from 2003 to 2016, this paper conducts an empirical analysis on the influence of patent level on outward foreign direct investment via analytical method of equal part linear regression and Grey Computing. By comparing analysis results with the model and the results with conventional linear regression model, the difference of different regression models is observed. Furthermore, the impact of China's patent level on China's inter-provincial outward foreign direct investment is further analyzed.

AB This paper describes authors' experience with designing and teaching a new course on "Fundamentals of Automation Engineering", based on a hybrid Project-Based Learning approach. The proposed challenge for students was to develop a low-cost Material Handling Machine, equipped with basic control functions. The project was executed in three stages, with different activities/tasks performed during each stage, which finally led to successful completion of the challenge. Detailed course file containing syllabus, learning objectives, assessment rubric, project goals, and deliverables was provided to students at first stage. Handouts and assignments were also provided weekly to students, which required extensive use of library resources (self-learning). Feedback survey was conducted fortnightly and suggestions were considered for course improvement. In this paper, authors discuss course organization, learning and assessment activities, and perception of students.

AB To overcome the "staircase effect" while preserving the structural information such as image edges and textures quickly and effectively, we propose a compensating total variation image denoising model combining L-1 and L-2 norm. A new compensating regular term is designed, which can perform anisotropic and isotropic diffusion in image denoising, thus making up for insufficient diffusion in the total variation model. The algorithm first uses local standard deviation to distinguish neighborhood types. Then, the anisotropic diffusion based on L-1 norm plays the role of edge protection in the strong edge region. The anisotropic and the isotropic diffusion simultaneously exist in the smooth region, so that the weak textures can be protected while overcoming the "staircase effect" effectively. The simulation experiments show that this method can effectively improve the peak signal-to-noise ratio and obtain the higher structural similarity index and the shorter running time.

AB In the Chinese national strategic context of "Internet Plus", innovation of internet technologies and business models play crucial roles in driving economic growth. The research shows that gross domestic product (GDP), logistics infrastructure and internet penetration of the target countries rank the top 3 of factors that influence export scale via cross-border e-commerce, while the distance to China and tariff constitute negative roles. It is on this assumption that logistics information database of cross-border e-commerce export and foreign infrastructure construction is proposed to expedite trade between China and countries along the Belt and Road.

ID MODEL
AB Architectural design can be considered an information-adding process, and within this process, each design decision provides information that uncovers some uncertainty regarding what is to be constructed. In early design stages, cost estimation is indispensable for subsequent decision making, but it cannot be accurate owing to the uncertainty associated with decisions that have not been made. This study proposes a Monte Carlo simulation-based method for designers to estimate potential trends in the construction cost of future design developments. The simulation reveals the probability distribution of construction cost via massive sampling over acceptable ranges of cost-affecting factors that have not yet been uncovered in the current design stage. The simulation result can serve as a part of a dashboard that provides guidance to designers for more optimally controlling construction cost.

AB As the investment directions and importance of high-tech enterprises increased largely, it is especially important to choose the most appropriate and effective investment for high-tech enterprises according to national conditions and economic conditions. In view of this, this paper proposes and constructs an investment decision-making scheme evaluation method of high-tech enterprises based on multi-objective neural network. The feasibility of the method was verified by investment decision-making scheme evaluation example of commercial bank. The results show that investment decision-making scheme B can best balance initial investment and capacity elasticity. The proposed method can be generalized to evaluation of other similar investment decision-making schemes.

AB This study is a corpus-driven examination of keywords in the news texts related to China's Belt and Road project reported by China's English news media and America's English news media. Keywords retrieved from corpus are often taken to be markers of "aboutness" in specialized corpus. They may be "a guide to the writer's evaluative position." Some of them, when explored in more detail, help to reveal evaluative attitudes. In this study, two corpora (China's news report corpus and America's news report corpus) are built and the computer corpus tool AntConc3.4.3 is used to generate keywords of these two corpora respectively for detailed concordance analysis in order to reveal different attitudes toward Belt and Road project held by these two countries' news media. The findings demonstrate that China's news reports emphasize mutual benefit and reciprocity among the parties involved; while America's news reports emphasize America's worry about China's development because they claim that China poses a threat to America's national status and interests. This study can help readers understand different news media' attitudes toward the Belt and Road project and help them think in a critical way while they read news reports of the same topic produced by different news media.

AB Leaving school for a period of time can have significant effects on students' academic success. In this article, we analyze how taking an academic break for a different number of semesters affects students' academic performance in terms of their Grade Point Average. This study is conducted at a university in Korea by analysing academic records of 653 undergraduate students who entered the university from 1998 to 2013. In addition, 101 currently enrolled students were surveyed to collect students' opinions on the effects of academic breaks. We investigate changes in grades before and after a school leave and compare the final grades of students who had academic breaks to students who continued their studies without having any breaks during their undergraduate education.Our results indicate that students' grades improve after coming back to the university from a four or more consecutive semesters break, however their final GPAs did not statistically differ from their peers who studied continuously, this suggests that students should not be afraid of taking longer academic breaks.

AB Augmented reality is gaining presence in the classroom because it allows to combine the physical environment and digital information in real time. An implementation of augmented reality that is attracting great attention are quick response codes because they can be read immediately in smartphones and tablets using free apps. A teaching field where it is beneficial to provide a prompt access to supplementary materials are laboratory sessions in scientific-technical disciplines. There, students realize complex measurement tasks using specific instrumentation, and so it is convenient to access technical documentation and explanations of the measurement process during the session. This work describes how quick response codes can be introduced in laboratory sessions to provide links to specifically designed supporting resources. Thanks to this strategy, an improvement in the acquisition of experimental skills has been observed as well as a better and quicker realization of the practical sessions.

AB In this paper, we propose an efficient three-module pedagogical system for embedded systems learning, which will provide students effective ways of learning embedded systems through basic concepts, current technology for hardware and software design, and team projects. The proposed pedagogical approach is based on the systematic learning through evidence-based teaching, knowledge mobilization, and research strategies. In our approach, it is recommended to use two platforms, mu Vision (simulator) and one microcontroller (hardware), such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi is a small single-board computer, which can be used as a brain for innovative computing projects, such as network monitoring tool, at a reasonable cost. Arduino is the most popular microcontroller (based on the ATmega328), which is a flexible and easy-to-use device for conducting various embedded systems projects. Those platforms have been used for many embedded systems projects, including home automation, Internet of Things, robots, games, and servers. We evaluated our proposed three modules based on student performance and feedback. As a result, we conclude that the proposed modules work better than a traditional learning methodology.

AB For improving the energy efficiency level in industrial systems, the service specialists should take appropriate measures to improve the efficiency in a timely manner. A necessity arises to provide adequate training for current and future specialists and practitioners. This training can be based on the digital technologies taking into account the information revolution we are witnessing and the future trends in this field. In this paper, a unified training methodology and laboratory equipment on energy efficiency investigation in induction motor drives is developed based on a developed automated computer system. The methodology is provided with created software products based on developed complex algorithms. The methodology procedure and the corresponding learning processes are organized into six main stages. In order to implement the method in the training of specialists, a computer laboratory bench is designed and implemented. The training is provided with three elaborated textbooks. The education conducted using the methodology improves the competence of the trained persons and gives them the opportunity to make justified and correct decisions and take relevant actions. The proposed development is used for educating number of students in some master programs in the University of Ruse. A major part of them already works in the field.

DE Deep submicron CMOS processes; education; laboratory work; TCAD tools
AB This article discusses one exemplary and one original laboratory work from the micro- and nano-electronics manufacturing process laboratory works cycle. These laboratory works have been successfully introduced into the undergraduate programme and have been attended by students for several years at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, Faculty of Electronics. This laboratory work is unique in that it consistently displays and graphically depicts practically all CMOS transistor manufacturing processes: from the preparation of the silicon wafer to the final passivation. Silvaco TCAD tools are used in order to simulate these technological processes. This type of laboratory works provides students with the necessary knowledge of chip manufacturing processes and TCAD tools without the use of costly manufacturing equipment specific to each technological process in the fabrication chain, long-term experiments and a large amount of human resources. This article also presents and discusses student feedback statistics over several years of studies, the advantages of this laboratory work, recommendations for further improvement and formulates conclusions.

AB As the bonds of China's listed companies have been popularized recently, it becomes an important subject faced by governments at all levels to display the listed companies' role in currency regulation and control policies in the bond filed; an estimate method for the listed companies' bond price equilibrium model based on the accounting information of public-private partnership financing pattern has been proposed in this paper. First, the bond price equilibrium estimate model of the listed companies is constructed on the counterweight and restriction to the bond market price of the listed companies by the financial institutions, bond institutions, and credit institutions of the listed companies to make efficient estimate on the bond price equilibrium model of listed companies and deeply analyze the influences of monetary policy on the bond price trend of the domestic listed companies. According to the experimental result, prudent policy at the national level remains necessary to the bond price of the current listed companies in resisting the financing risk to reduce the loan-to-value of the listed companies in the bond field.

AB H-bridge multilevel converter is the most challenging topology from nominal to high power applications. However, when the energy is exchanged between AC side and DC side or vice versa, the fluctuation in the capacitor used in deputize unit is unavoidable. The fluctuation in the deputize unit is due to the increase in the total harmonic distortion by the capacitor in the output voltages. This total harmonic distortion is evaded by exploring the deputize unit capacitor voltage mathematically. This paper proposes the enhanced frequency shift carrier modulation in H-bridge multilevel converter to suppress the influence of fluctuation in deputize unit capacitor voltages. Enhanced frequency shift carrier modulation is considered for nonlinear compensation. The principal results of using this enhanced frequency shift carrier modulation improvise the total harmonic distortion in the output voltage of H-bridge multilevel converter. Simulation and experimental results are done using MATLAB/SIMULINK to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB This study focused on the investigation of career variables as correlate work stress of electrical/electronic trade teachers of technical colleges in south west Nigeria. The study had nine specific objectives and six hypotheses tested at 0.05 level of significance to guide the study. A total of 185 electrical/electronic trade teachers of technical colleges made up of the population for the study. The study adopted correlation research design and the structured questionnaire was used to collect data from the respondent. However, the study found that the electrical/electronic trade teachers experienced high job stress, experienced low satisfaction in their teaching profession and exhibited high job performances. The study found positive correlation between work stress and job satisfaction, between work stress and job performances and between job satisfaction and job performances. It was obtained from the result that age, gender and experience did not statistically influence work stress, job satisfaction and job performances. Meanwhile, the type of teacher significantly influences work stress and job satisfaction. It is recommended that more qualified teachers should be employed for the teachers to be more relieved of their duties which can lead to work stress. Teachers of technical colleges should be motivated and satisfied to ensure more productivity and ensure that effect of work stress is reduced.

ID SCOPE
AB In the 21st century, electrical power enterprises face the flood of new technologies and an aging workforce of professional engineers. To address this shortage, heightening the competences of current electrical engineering students is essential. Although researchers have raised these issues and presented expedient methodologies, they have not enhanced graduation rates because many young students are declining the electrical engineering major due to many factors. Nevertheless, the declining percentage must be addressed in the electrical engineering education system; hence this article implemented a research approval assessment technique to engage electrical engineering students' interest with their major, enhance academic research and professional skills, and excel at their electrical engineering degree in the School of Electrical Engineering at Wuhan University, China. The assessment process assists students in recalling and integrating their interests to fulfill degree requirements and select future research, practicing engineering software, and enhancing the collaborative skills necessary for their future engineering careers. Although many students were involved in research approval assessment process, this article focuses on a Pakistani student's approval process, detailing their topic of Pakistan power sector challenges (ferroresonance presence as high profile challenge), and evaluation results. The results indicated that students' interests not only engage them effectively but also motivate their success.

AB As autonomous cars and complex features of them grow in popularity, ensuring that analyses and capabilities are reproducible and repeatable has taken on importance in education plans too. This paper describes a reproducible research plan on mini autonomous race car programming. This educational plan is designed and implemented as part of a summer internship program at Kocaeli University and it consists of theoretical courses and laboratory assignments. A literate programming approach with the Python language is used for programming the race car. To assess the educational program's impact on the learning process and to evaluate the acceptance and satisfaction level of students, they answered an electronic questionnaire after finishing the program. According to students' feedback, the reproducible educational program is useful for learning and consolidating new concepts of mini autonomous car programming.

AB The Saudi Vision 2030 plan is based on three pillars: the Kingdom's statues as a center for Arab and Islamic countries, stimulating the economy by diversifying revenues and taking advantage of the strategic location that makes the country a center of trade and gateway to the world. The initiative to establish the city of Neom emerges to achieve the objective of reducing the country's dependence on oil, diversifying its economy, and developing public services sectors. NEOM project focuses on several sectors such as energy and water, mobility, biotech, advanced manufacturing, and digital sciences. One of the main sustainability factors for a smart city as NEOM project is the human factor. It is important to qualify engineers to be able to operate and maintain digital technology such as internet of things applications and devices. In this article, we propose integrating the internet of things technology and applications into the electrical engineering education to introduce students to the future skills and enable them to participate in the sustainability of Saudi Vision 2030.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Cloud computing has paved an excellent platform for the emergence of cost-effective technological solutions. However, security and privacy issues still remain as a stringent challenge during service catering. Explicitly, the service utility anomalies are liable to cause severe privacy and security issues in cloud service delivery. So, the overall performance of cloud service consumption and end-user applications' service levels utility is degraded. The open access and distributed nature of the cloud computing is the major reason for its vulnerability to intruders. The security and privacy in cloud services have many challenges and problems still open for research. This paper proposes an intrusion detection method capable of detecting nine categories of attacks in two stages. This paper focuses on establishing a network-based intrusion detection mechanism using machine learning techniques. A model will be constructed with a supervised learning methodology using historical network flowdata and flowdata collected from the Internet.

AB The feature translation and potential semantic-indexing performance, attention and development direction of multilingual text background text clustering in cross-language English translation are analyzed through multigroup experiments. Based on the two methods of feature translation and potential semantic indexing, two kinds of text clustering experiments were carried out on the background text of multi-language text in English translation, and the recall rate, accuracy rate, and F value were compared. The method based on feature translation is relatively simple and can obviously improve the clustering effect of multilingual text. Due to the time and space complexity of the method itself and other inherent defects, the final result of the method based on potential semantic indexing is unsatisfactory. The richness of samples needs to be further expanded, and it is expected that the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) method will be more fully tested in a high-performance computing environment. The method based on feature translation needs to further improve the performance of the translation system, and the LSI method needs to solve problems such as computational complexity and K value selection.

AB Multi-tenancy is an essential feature in cloud computing and is a major component to achieve scalability and energy-efficient solution to gain high level of economic benefits. As the cloud, computing is gaining more audiences and high user base, the problem of scheduling the computational workflow for multi-tenant cloud scheduling is becoming a difficult task to achieve. In this study, we present a learning-based scheduler for catering heterogeneous software and hardware resources in the context of multi-tenant cloud computing. The experimentation has been carried out with the help of green cloud simulator and the results are compared with the state of the art techniques like minimum completion time, first come first serve and backfilling. The experimental results exhibit that the presented algorithm provides an effective means of utilizing cloud resources in addition with drastic reduction in cost of operation.

AB The Bayesian network method is introduced into the process of fire risk quantitative assessment. The event tree model is established, and the Bayesian network model is transformed from the event tree model based on the typical fire scenarios in high-rise space. A Bayesian fire risk assessment algorithm for high-rise buildings based on mutual information reliability is proposed. Bayesian network is modified considering the influence of uncertainties. Finally, the modified Bayesian network model is used to calculate the probability of fire developing to different stages, and the estimated value of property loss is used to express the severity of the accident and calculate the fire risk value. The results show that the existence of uncertainties has a significant impact on the results of risk assessment; the quantitative assessment method based on Bayesian network is better than the ETA method based on event tree analysis in dealing with uncertainties and is more suitable for high-rise space fire risk assessment.

DE Cr12MoV steel; microstructure; mechanical properties; RE-Ti compound
   modification
AB In this paper, near net shape casting technology was used to manufacture Cr12MoV steel die modified using RE-Ti. The samples with different RE(rare earth)-Ti content were fabricated by using the induction furnace. The microstructure of the samples was analyzed by using optical microscope and scanning electron microscope. Electronic universal tensile test machine, pendulum impact tester and rockwell apparatus were utilized to test the mechanical properties of the samples. The results show that after RE-Ti compound modification, the distribution and morphology of carbide are improved, and with the Ti increase, the impact toughness significantly increases, and tensile strength has a slight increase, but hardness is almost unchanged. When Ti content is 0.6%, the impact toughness and tensile strength are 14.9 J/cm(2) and 634 MPa, respectively, reaching or approaching to the mechanical properties of the forged Cr12MoV steel.

DE Blood vessel; detection of diabetic retinopathy; retinal nerve

AB Diabetic retinopathy is a common condition of an ailment where the retina is harmed on the grounds that fluid breaks away from the walls of blood vessels into the retina. The large population is affected by diabetic retinopathy and hence research in the area of automated screening has acquired major research interest in the scientific community. The diagnosing features for diabetic retinopathy comprises of identifying deformations of minute blood vessel in form of exudates and its features occurring in and around the regions of fundus which will result into exudes, hemorrhages, or microaneurysms. This feature is often hard to be classified by naked eyes and need trained personnel for close inspection before making diagnosis. Therefore, a comprehensive machine learning tool is in the demand for automated diabetic retinopathy detection. Neural networks have given promising results in the field of classification. Therefore, we present a hybrid neural network-based method with realistic clinical potential. In this study, we present a neuro-fuzzy technique, which is developed for identification of exudates in retinal images and is utilized for the extraction of essential features from the retinal images of patient's eyeballs. We trained this hybrid neural network base technique over a set of 25,600 training images for color retinal images and tested it over 12,000 testing image set for binocular model. The method achieves an accuracy of 95.4% recognition on non-noisy images and 93% on noisy images; thereby giving a consistency rate of 91% in correspondence with the ophthalmologist.

AB One of the most and essential parts of weather forecasting is the prediction of a tropical cyclone. All over the world there are weather prediction stations to analyze the natural disasters for safeguarding the people before they would get any damage. Cyclone is one of the dangerous natural catastrophes that several researchers have undergone research over it, and many technologies were developed to find accurate results for its prediction. Several algorithms were proposed for classifying the cyclone data in terms of latitude, longitude, wind speed, and pressure. Still, it is a significant challenge for most of the researchers for predicting the accurate measurement and observations for cyclonic data. In this paper, a hybrid model is proposed, which is a combination of Genetic Algorithm and XP boost for predicting cyclone severity. The data are collected from the Bay of Bengal Ocean, which has been used in the proposed model for classification. Simulation results show a better improvement in predicting the tropical cyclone categories by using the proposed model. Furthermore, comparison of other existing algorithms with the proposed technique is also discussed.

AB This paper describes three step response-based system identification methods of increasing complexity, together with a range of exercises that will enhance student understanding of this area in an engaging and practical way. For illustration purposes and practicality, it is assumed that the model to be identified is of the first-order plus dead time type. The first method uses a popular graphical technique, which is easy to understand and apply, but inaccurate when the response data are not ideal. The second uses the Nelder-Mead simplex method, which is a more powerful technique and has the added benefit of introducing undergraduate students to the concepts of numerical optimisation. The third uses an integral equation algorithm. The latter two methods, which can be readily extended to other model structures and input types, are also demonstrated using experimental data obtained from a tank level control system.

AB Test and diagnosis of the characteristics of the air flow induced by the pneumatic actuation of the plasma are the important basis for the plasma flow control. In order to well understand the electrical characteristics of the pneumatic actuation of the plasma and the influence of the actuation voltage amplitude and the phase on the induced flow characteristics, the dielectric barrier discharge actuators symmetrically distributed were selected for the experimental research. The experiment result shows that the discharge form of the actuators symmetrically distributed is filamentary discharge, uniformly occurring around the high-voltage electrodes, and this is different from the discharge picture of the actuators asymmetrically distributed; when the voltage applied on the high-voltage electrode near to the actuators has the same amplitude and phase, the induced directional jet flow is vertical to the actuator surface, and the speed is at the order of meter per second; the change of the amplitude or phase of the voltage applied on the high-voltage electrode of the actuator can induce a jet flow towards the upper left or the upper right, but cannot effectively increase the induced airflow velocity.

AB In this paper, a novel prototype laboratory is presented for engineering education, in which experiments are based on the fractional calculus. The prototypes of analog and digital fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers are built in the laboratory. These fractional-order PID controllers are applied to linear and nonlinear plants to demonstrate the effectiveness of fractional-order calculus in real time. These experiments are designed, developed, and implemented on the analog and digital platforms. These controllers are integrated to control the DC motor, brushless DC motor, and magnetic levitation modules through hardware-in-loop as well as stand-alone systems. The analog type of fractional-order PID implementation is carried out by using passive components (i.e. resistances and capacitances) with an operational amplifier. However, real-time digital implementation is carried out using field-programmable gate array and digital signal processor. This paper describes how the experiments on fractional calculus can be tailored for graduate, undergraduate students' education and extended for research in this emerging area.

AB A single-juncture topology of 3-o boost inverter with riven DC supply configuration grieves from larger incidence current commutations across the diode(passive) in connection with the DC source and the intricate study as the inductor charges with capricious duty cycle. This study focuses on 1-o riven bias inverter with improvised technique on inverter and modulation. The riven bias inverter is analyzed using state space averaging technique to derive the mathematical model that is suitable for both steady-state and dynamic behavior conditions considering main converter nonlinearities. Hence, the research is carry forwarded in modeling the riven bias inverter on DC section with digital space vector modulation control technique to obtain decoupled control structure in lattice network and the work is validated by means of MATLAB/SIMULINK.

AB The fourth Industrial Revolution is rapidly growing due to the development of ICT and the need for organic linkage in the industry. The Internet of Things (IoT), in which objects and objects from active relationships such as sensing, networking and mutual cooperation without human intervention is the core technology of the fourth Industrial Revolution, which can be linked to various industrial fields. As the IoT environment spreads, IoT devices are continuously increasing in various industries. IoT devices connected to the Internet are as different as each application environment. Many information is derived from the interaction between an IoT device and a device or between a human and an IoT device, as well as devices that provide simple data such as sensing. This paper proposes a support method to enable extended service search when users search for services using information generated in IoT environment. The existing service discovery method focuses on the method by which the user selects the service based on the simple service information disclosed by the service provider. In order to solve the problem of existing service discovery method, this study proposed a support method that enables users to search service discovery flexibly even when using existing methods in service discovery in IoT environment. The proposed method provides a user-centered service search environment construction through a search method using user IoT information which was not considered in the existing service search. This makes up for the problem of service availability and provider-oriented service discovery through the establishment of a user service discovery environment.

AB The electric power system is undergoing important changes and updates nowadays, particularly on a generation and transmission level. Initially, the move towards a distributed generation in distinction to the present centralized one implies a major assimilation of energy from undeleted supply and electricity storage systems. Advanced power physics interfacing systems are expected to play a key role within the development of such modern governable and economical large-scale grids and associated infrastructures. Throughout the last era, a worldwide analysis and development interest has been impressed within the field of segmental structure conversion; thanks to the well-known offered blessings over typical solutions within the medium and high voltage and power range. Within the context of battery energy storage systems, the segmental structure conversion device family exhibits a further attraction, i.e., the aptitude of embedding such storage parts in an exceedingly split manner, given the existence of many submodules operative at considerably lower voltages. This study deals with many technical challenges related to segmental structure converters and their development with battery energy storage parts to boost load sharing system.

AB A proper and successful methodology of electrical contact design is achieved by combining the theoretical and practical studies. This paper presents an instructional approach involving FEM simulations in order to aid in the practical operations on electrical contacts in MV and HV electrical apparatuses effectively. Prior to the completed engineering and scientific work in the field of the electrical apparatuses, constructing the FEM-based model is an effective way to achieve and understand the pros and cons of the experimental solutions. This design method is widely used by the industrial companies and can be implemented as an educational method giving young engineers a new edge. The desired effect of the proposed course was to develop student understanding of electrical contacts engineering by combining the theoretical (simulations) and the practical approach. Ordered creativity was successfully put into practice by checking the parameters derived from the simulations on the real scale layout, which affected and enhanced student confidence in the field and in engineering skills. This instructional approach consisted of two sections (The Theoretical and the Practical) and is essential for understanding and further exploiting the acquired knowledge and certain other measures in engineering work. Moreover, it renders a complete engineering experience employing consequences and their impact on experimental electrical contact research based on multitasking and diversity. The statistical analysis proved that the proposed method had a significant impact and yielded improved results. Moreover, a major improvement in student learning and satisfaction after participating in the proposed course was noted.

AB Gesture recognition aims at understanding dynamic gestures of the human body and is one of the most important ways of human-computer interaction; to extract more effective spatiotemporal features in gesture videos for more accurate gesture classification, a novel feature extractor network, spatiotemporal attention 3D DenseNet is proposed in this study. We extend DenseNet with 3D kernels and Refined Temporal Transition Layer based on Temporal Transition Layer, and we also explore attention mechanism in 3D ConvNets. We embed the Refined Temporal Transition Layer and attention mechanism in DenseNet3D, named the proposed network "spatiotemporal attention 3D DenseNet." Our experiments show that our Refined Temporal Transition Layer performs better than Temporal Transition Layer and the proposed spatiotemporal attention 3D DenseNet in each modality outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on the ChaLearn LAP Large-Scale Isolated gesture dataset. The code and pretrained model are released in https://github.com/dzf19927/STA3D.

AB To explore the learning effect of mainland students taught by Taiwan professors, this paper collects data through questionnaires and uses the multiple equal part linear regression to analyse the data. This paper explores the influence caused by factors such as the position of the images and the size or density of the word in the textbooks, which is in traditional Chinese character, used by professors from Taiwan. And other factors like the interest of students to the course and the motivation of the course selection are also analysed in this paper. Research results show that: all the typesetting factors and the motivation of the course selection have a great influence on students with poor learning performance. And the interest to the course also has a high impact on students with poor or moderate learning performance. Our research focuses on applying complex computing methods-including fuzzy computing and multiple equal part linear regression-to studies in education areas. It encourages more innovative interdisciplinary researches in the future.

TI Mechanism analysis on ground settlement induced by vacuum removal

DE Soft clayey soil; vacuum preloading; deformation; vacuum removal
ID STIFFNESS; SOILS; FIELD
AB Due to the settlement hazards induced by the soft clayey soils, vacuum preloading has been widely used all over the world. Many studies focus on the process of vacuum application but the process of vacuum removal is generally ignored. Different from observations on surcharge preloading, ground settlement rather than heave occurred during vacuum removal. In this study, a stress-controlled triaxial test was carried out to simulate both processes of vacuum application and removal applied on a clayey soil and hence the mechanism of ground settlement induced by vacuum removal is discussed. Compressive axial strain was observed during the decrease of isotropic stress that simulated vacuum removal. To better understand the observed deformation characteristics of the clayey soils during vacuum removal, in this study, a simple anisotropic elastic model was used. The happening of ground settlement of the clayey soil during vacuum removal is mainly because that the Young's modulus in the vertical direction is higher than that in the horizontal direction. Lateral extension is dominant for the ground deformation during vacuum removal.

AB This paper studies the factors affecting college students' professional competence, establishes the evaluation index system of college students' professional competence, and makes a quantitative analysis of each index; the weight of each index is determined by analytic hierarchy process. This paper introduces the method of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation to calculate the scores of each student's professional ability and the module of individual professional ability to solve the problem of fuzziness and uncertainty of students' professional ability. However, the calculation process is too complicated to automatically adjust the membership function and fuzzy rules when using fuzzy mathematics to evaluate students' professional ability. In this paper, a new mathematical model of comprehensive evaluation is designed. A combined algorithm-fuzzy neural network algorithm-is proposed by using the advantages of fuzzy analysis and neural network in evaluation; a fuzzy neural network model of college students' professional ability is established. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Characterized by large scale, variety, fast generation, extremely high value but low density, big data can be used to mine effective information, provide users with auxiliary decision-making and realize its own value. The gap of traffic resources among different regions will affect the coordinated development of regional economy and widen the gap of wealth among regions. Under the background of emphasizing the coordinated development of regional economy in China, it is particularly important to study the allocation and utilization rate of highway resources in China. Based on the data of 31 provincial administrative regions from 2000 to 2014, this paper combines the Dagum Gini coefficient decomposition method with the extended distribution dynamics model to study the dynamic evolution of regional gap and distribution of highway scale from the perspective of "quantity" and "quality". It is found that the gap of quality is more severe than that of quantity in China. The quality gap between East China and West China is the greatest, while the quantity gap is smaller, which indicates that China should pay attention to the utilization rate of highway resources while emphasizing the rational allocation, and check whether the supply of resources in the regions with busy and developed logistics services meets the demand while promoting economic growth by improving traffic accessibility.

ID AUTOMATIC TARGET RECOGNITION; FACE RECOGNITION; DATA FUSION
AB Learning visual models of object classes conventionally require hundreds or a large number of training samples. Conventional gradient-based approaches for target recognition require lot of data to be trained on and require exhaustive training with high computational expense. Hence, when a new condition or untrained data is encountered, such systems inadequately misconfigure newly learned feature sets in the trained model. This misconfigures the structure of re-learned features and is then carried out in subsequent recognition stages. Thus, a development in this scenario with low training time will allow us to fend of this disadvantage. This study presents a new automatic target recognition framework that gives the enhanced performance of target-recognition system when several imaging sensors are connected with one another. This is in contrast with traditional automatic target recognition frameworks, which utilizes one-on-one computational model over synthetic-aperture radar image-processing systems. The work comprises of a learning-based classifications strategy when dealing with sharing of learned parameters over the network to discern critical changes in target-recognition performance by utilizing a novel one-shot learning-based reconfigurable learning network for image processing platform.

AB In a deregulated electricity market, it may at times become challenging to swift all the essential power which are obligatory to move along the transmission line due to congestion. This paper primly waltz up the finest allotment of thyristor-controlled series compensator in deregulated capacity setup with wind generator by considering the maximization of social welfare cost as objective function. In this work, hybrid market model has been considered and the hybrid algorithm is used as a tool, in which Gravitational Search Algorithm is used for attaining optimal location of thyristor-controlled series compensator as major issue, though Genetic Algorithm-based top-notch outflow of power minimizes operating cost after incorporating thyristor-controlled series compensator and Wind Generator as sub-optimization problem. The coherence of this prospective has been tested and analyzed on modified IEEE 14-bus system and modified IEEE 118-bus system at different loading conditions. The influences on the locational marginal pricing and system voltage have been also investigated in this work and the obtained results are compared with other globally accepted techniques reported in the literary texts.

AB This paper selects delta high-speed parallel robot with three degrees of freedom as the research object. The trajectory planning strategies of Cartesian space and angular displacement, angular velocity and angular acceleration of three joints in high-speed handling are studied. Firstly, the critical trajectory points starting point and end point, and points for obstacle avoidance height are set up, and then according to the inverse kinematics model of the robot, a point-to-point "door" type moving trajectory is established, and the mapping relationship between the motion characteristics of the operating space and the motion characteristics of the joint space is established by using the 4-3-4 degree polynomial motion law in the operating space. However, aiming at the higher energy consumption of 4-3-4 degree polynomial interpolation caused by longer the trajectory, and difficult control of obstacle avoidance height, one key point is added. Thereby, the motion rules are interpolated by 4-3-3-4 degree polynomial interpolation, and the mapping relationship between the motion characteristics of the operating space and the motion characteristics of the joint space is established. Two trajectory planning methods are simultaneously simulated under the same keys points and the same trajectory time range. The motion characteristics of the joint rotation angle of the parallel robot between polynomial interpolations are respectively compared. The results show that the trajectory planning method based on 4-3-3-4 degree polynomial interpolation in joint space has obvious advantages in improving the running state of the delta parallel robot and reducing the energy consumption of the system.

ID DIFFUSION EQUATION
AB In this paper, we aim to study the stochastic simulation for time and space fractional differential equations. First, we prove that the stochastic solution of the time and space fractional differential equation is a stable subordinated process driven by the stable Levy motion. Then, the absorbent term is employed for this equation; we find the corresponding parent process yields to be driven by a tempered stable process. At last, we design an algorithm to simulate the trajectory of the proposed process. The Monte Carlo methods are also employed to get the approximated solution of the fractional differential equations. The contribution of this paper is to establish the relation between the time and space fractional differential equations and stochastic process, and provide the stochastic simulation algorithm for this fractional differential equations.

AB A nonlinear regression analysis method for performance evaluation of poverty reduction of agricultural operators based on Stakeholder Theory Model analysis was proposed to improve the effectiveness of performance evaluation of poverty reduction of a new type agricultural operator in poverty-stricken areas. Firstly, it can find out which interest demands of different stakeholders and which interest realization paths have significant impact on the task performance and peripheral performance of the policy supply of new agricultural operators through factor analysis and regression analysis of the questionnaire data of stakeholders to provide sufficient basis for the appropriate revision and adjustment of policy supply; secondly, the nonlinear regression model is established by using the nonlinear least squares method to fit, control, and forecast the performance evaluation of poverty reduction behavior of agricultural operators, which is more accurate than linear regression in both object and method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by empirical analysis.

AB Text clustering system is a proper technique which mainly segments large measure of textual documents into clusters. The size of the material influences the clustering of text by reducing its performance. In this manner, the textual document comprises sparse and uninformative features, and thus raises the computational time and decreases the execution of primary clustering process. Feature selection is a crucial system to choose another subset of instructive text feature to enhance text clustering execution and diminish computational time. The implemented model proposes a 2logmean-particle swarm optimization algorithm for the unstructured text clustering. In this newly proposed technique, all the texts are initially converted into ASCII value, and then by using the particle swarm optimization, the document text is clustered. The outcomes display that clustering accuracy of the implemented method is high compared to the existing K-means algorithm. Furthermore, performances of newly implemented techniques are evaluated concerning scalability, less computation speed with colossal dimensionality reduction.

AB Internet technology has been invariably infused in all the aspects of engineering student's life, excessive of which can lead to destruction in health, behaviour, academic grades and job performance. Personality disposition is one of the major factors in developing digital addiction among students from technical discipline. The study aims to explore the predictive ability of personality traits (introversion and emotional intelligence) on internet addiction and the mediating role of the emotional intelligence on the association between introversion and rampant usage of the internet. A sample of 260 students was picked up from engineering colleges with the mean age of 22.3 years. Internet Addiction Test, emotional intelligence questionnaire and McCroskey introversion scale were administered to gather related data. SPSS, structural equation modelling with partial least square and PROCESS macro were used to perform statistical and mediational analyses. The data were analysed with multivariate correlation, hierarchical regression, structural equation modelling and mediational analysis using the bootstrapping method. The results discovered that emotional intelligence and introversion have a noteworthy predictive effect on the level of internet addiction. Mediation analysis shows that emotional intelligence has full mediation effect on the relation between introversion and internet addiction. Excessive internet usage taking a toll on the mental and physical health of engineering students, whereas personality traits are playing a crucial role in developing such a behavioural addiction, and therefore, early detection and prevention is needed urgently.

AB Quick progressions in the improvement of intelligent and smart machines and parallel advancement of technologies in the field of wireless communication have achieved more prominent statures. However, certain issues still pertain when one tries to develop a hybrid network. A heterogeneous vehicular network is developed with the idea of utilizing the readily available infrastructures such as long-term evolution and dedicated short-range communication, which is economically profitable. We discussed some of the issues that arise when we converge dedicated short-range communication and long-term evolution and addressed certain issues such as creating a link to communicate between two different technologies that can be achieved by considering the baseband implementations of the two technologies in the physical layer and Media Access Control (MAC) levels. The efficiency of the system is observed at three distinguish multimedia transmission where a text file, audio file, and an image file are transmitted and the system's performance is observed by analyzing the bit error rate vs signal-to-noise ratio for each of the files. The results obtained justified that it is possible to create a heterogeneous vehicular network (HetVNet) even with the presence of certain elements diversities in the characteristics of long-term evolution and dedicated short-range communication.

It is very important and necessary to identify and avoid such illegal activities without harming anyone in the society. In recent decades, social networks are becoming a popular research area for most researchers. Many authors are doing research on social network datasets and proposing various anomaly detection mechanisms to identify anomalous activities in both static and dynamic growing social networks. Various anomaly detection techniques are proposed by the authors to investigate malicious activities in social networks. In general, the process of identifying anomaly activities of the users in the given dataset is called anomaly detection. The anomaly detection in social networks is the process of investigating whether the users of the given social networks are involved in illegal activities or not. In this work, we proposed a most elegant approach to identify the anomalous or outlier users in the given social network. The proposed approach is considering the users participated in multiple communities of social networks. The designed algorithms are implemented and tested in a big data environment three node cluster using open source Hadoop ecosystem tools. Algorithm1 is used to investigate the nodes/users who participated in multiple communities of the given social network's dataset. Algorithm2 takes the set of users participated in multiple communities and apply graph metrics such as degree and community score to predict the users involved in the anomalous activity.

AB A virtual scene dynamic interactive image segmentation technology based on OpenGL sky module is proposed to improve the performance of image dynamic interactive recognition algorithm and the recognition effect of image segmentation. First, an automatic dynamic interactive image segmentation algorithm is proposed, a probability segmentation model of Gauss mixture fracture based on multi-scale crack enhancement filter is established, and expectation maximization algorithm is used to determine the parameters of GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model) and the underlying segmentation; second, the drawing function of OpenGL is used to draw the graph, and the drawing method needs to be calculated. That is to say, a mathematical model is established, which converts the graph into the calculation of vertex coordinates for drawing. It uses an extended cost function to guide dynamic interactive image segmentation using a set of cracks from the population to be segmented. Finally, the validity of the algorithm is verified by experimental simulation.

AB To assist managers to provide efficient overall solution of the product service system for oil customers accurately, for the problem of oil customer churn forecast, I put forward a Forecast Management Model (Factor-TOPSIS) of analyzing TOPSIS model on oil consumption customer churn forecast management based on residual error correction factor. This method includes constructing the oil customer churn model of product service system and FACTOR-TOPSIS algorithm model. At first, FACTOR-TOPSIS algorithm adopts the parameters of support vector machine which are represented by gray TOPSIS, and initializes the position and velocity of gray TOPSIS group based on Sobol sequence, and then the method of introducing dynamic adaptive nonlinear inertial weight when position updating was adopted. At last, I analyze the case of the loss of an oil customer to verify the validity and feasibility of the above method in customer churn model of product service system, through the comparison of BPNN, SVM and PSO-SVM.

AB This paper reveals various constraints in digital way of estimating the age of human facial image. The age estimation involves analyzing the facial features and classifying the age in accordance to the extracted feature values. The biometric features such as the facial parts (eye, mouth, chin, forehead, hair), texture, color and shape provide essential aging details. In the proposed method, the fractal features are extracted using fractal directional code method to retain the significant details present in the input image. The fractal features along with the local features are used to train the system. The deep neural network with three layers is used to train the system. The scaled conjugate gradient back propagation trains the system and the age is classified into seven age groups (0-10, 11-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59 and 60-69). Higher accuracy is achieved by concocting the biometric features and the fractal features.

AB Digital filters are generally used to vary or modify the features of a signal in time or frequency domain. The most commonly used digital filter is FIR filter. FIR filter is mainly used in digital signal processing applications such as speech processing, sonar, radar and digital communication. The FIR filter is used to process the input signals by linear convolution algorithm. It involves series of addition and multiplication operation. So, the primary building block of the FIR filter is considered as multiply-accumulate (MAC) unit. This paper proposed to use novel floating point radix 4 algorithm to multiply the input impulse responses. This algorithm helps to enhance the performance of the filter in terms of speed. Various rounding techniques will be used for the filter accuracy. The output response of the proposed filter will be simulated in the virtual software and hardware environment with the MATLAB software. The brief investigation of the fixed and floating point signal will be discussed.

AB When systems evolve, the maintainability and the complexity of the system increase, resulting in the poor antidesign patterns or antipatterns in software maintenance. Refactoring is an operation used to improve the structure of an existing system by changing its internal structure without affecting its external behavior. Many studies revealed that refactoring is underused by software development team in industry due to its increased effort and lack of knowledge about existing approaches. Thus, a prioritized correction of antipatterns based on relevance of classes, analyzed development history, risk to refactor, minimized code changes, and maintainers context and preferences is needed for good refactoring recommendations. We propose an approach based on filtered relevant classes with generic linkage-based clustering and adapted nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III to find good refactoring recommendations, which maximize the software quality and reduce the refactoring effort. Our approach uses our own node centrality-based sub-graph isomorphism algorithm to dynamically understand the system with good accuracy prior to optimization. Our approach is evaluated on six open-source systems and the results have shown the effectiveness of our approach compared to the other existing ones.

AB With the continuous development of foreign language testing, more and more scholars have begun to pay attention to the ability of language to communicate in communication. At the beginning of the self-intellectual test, language proficiency has always been one of the key test subjects, and most of the intelligence tests also need to be tested by language and writing skills. Testing of English language proficiency is inseparable from the real language environment, but testing in a real environment is time-consuming and laborious. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a test method for rapid evaluation of English networks considering non-metric multidimensional scaling. This study aims to improve the platform test system of the current English network test by analyzing the algorithm characteristics of non-metric multidimensional scale and to optimize the existing English network fast test. At the same time, in order to test the applicability of the English network evaluation project under the algorithm characteristics of the non-metric multidimensional scale, some college students were selected for the test. The results of comparative analysis show that the rapid evaluation of English network based on non-metric multidimensional scale has good reliability and validity, which can effectively distinguish the merits of the assessors, and also can well test the students' level.

AB A novel beamforming scheme based on non-cooperative game theory for multi-user multiple input multiple output cognitive radio network is proposed. In a cognitive network, the secondary transmitter is allowed to access the primary network spectrum when the interference to the primary network is below certain power threshold. While transmitting, the secondary user should cause minimal interference to primary user. So it is inevitable to use a transmit beamformer at the secondary user to focus the beam to desired receiver. A distributed iterative algorithm is formulated through non-cooperative game approach for optimizing the beamforming along with optimum power allocation by maximizing signal to interference ratio of secondary users. This is achieved by deriving an optimal pricing policy for each secondary user, which adapts to the strategies offered by rest of the users, which eventually converges the game into Nash equilibrium. Non-cooperative optimization of transmit power leads to maximization of signal to interference ratio. Subsequently, channel capacity maximization is achieved through water filling algorithm. Through simulations, the effectiveness of the game theory based algorithm is validated and impact of beamforming on signal to interference ratio and system capacity is discussed. The paper is constructed to help graduate students and research scholars easily understand the concept and application of game theory.

ID DESIGN
AB Modeling and control of bidirectional dual active bridge DC-DC converter becomes an important issue as they are extensively used in electric vehicle applications. This work deals with design and simulation of closed loop isolated bidirectional dual active bridge DC-DC converter system with current mode control and in addition, cascade filter is implemented to reduce the ripples. The aim of this work is to improve the dynamic response of the closed loop bidirectional dual active bridge DC-DC converter system with two-loop current mode control. Current mode control can be used to improve the output voltage of the bidirectional dual active bridge DC-DC converter system. The proposed converter is initially modeled and simulated with PI-PI controller and latter with PR-PR controller. The dynamic response obtained from the two controllers is analyzed and compared. The results indicate that the dynamic response of the proposed converter is improved by using CM-PR-PR controller. The proposed converter has advantages like reduced "settling time" and "steady state error."

AB Resource satellite is a very important tool for earth resources exploration, utilization, development and management. To improve the efficiency of resource satellites, which provide services to national economy and social progress, there is an urgent demand for the application of mission planning theories and methods to solve practical problems in resource satellite management. Thus, a system framework of resource satellite management, control, development and utilization based on constellation mission planning and scheduling is designed. Aiming at the demands of satellite management, control, development and utilization departments, several intelligent modes of resource satellite system control management, upper-level architecture design and user demand analysis are constructed under this framework. As a result, this framework achieves a development of resource satellite management and control mode from single satellite scheduling to multi-satellite comprehensive application and increased utilization of resource satellites.

AB In telecommunications engineering degrees, simulations are used to understand better theoretical concepts. However, in courses related to digital communications or signal processing usually these simulations cannot be easily applied to real data or in real scenarios. This limitation does not allow the students to verify that the learned theoretical hypotheses are valid in practice. Nowadays, software defined radio platforms have been proposed to validate theoretical telecommunications concepts in real situations. Therefore, by combining a software defined radio and simulation tools, students can implement the learned notions over real data in real scenarios. This allows students to work under real applications in order to learn by experience and to see that the theoretical concepts are valid in the real world. This paper presents a project involving real-time decoding of automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) signals, implemented by using a universal software radio peripheral software defined radio and MATLAB (R). The universal software radio peripheral allows to receive real automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast signals sent by the aircraft. Then, by using MATLAB (R) tools, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast baseband signals are decoded. The students are guided through a manual to demodulate the real automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast signals and display in a map the aircraft trajectories. The evaluation is based on a competition between the students, considering execution time of their algorithms, and a final report of the project. This project allows to obtain a game-oriented and novel approach for teaching digital communications and signal processing. The implementation of this project in telecommunications engineering courses motivate the students, allowing them to understand better difficult theoretical concepts, and improve their computer, teamwork, and collaboration skills. The originality of the approach is based on the usage of a prototyping platform, combined with simulation tools, for practical application of telecommunications engineering concepts using real signals.

AB In order to get the time-varying characteristics of grain combine harvester's vibration, accelerometers were placed at the measuring points on the seat base and the chassis bracket, and the time-domain and time-frequency characteristics were analyzed by the short-time Fourier transform method under the excitation of the cutter, the engine and the sieve. It was found that the amplitude change rate of each frequency component of the engine was >30% and the maximum was 115%. And the amplitude change rate of the sieve was generally 170%-240%, with the maximum reaching 307.8%. Therefore, the engine and vibrating screen cannot be considered as a stable vibration source. The cutter excitation frequency was mainly concentrated on the fundamental frequency and frequency multiplier <80 Hz, the amplitude was more stable.

AB Cascaded boost and reboost converter with inverter (CBRBIS) is a better choice to be considered in between PV source and DC load. This work proposes cascading of boost and reboost converter to increase the voltage gain. This paper deals with the combination of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) and voltage control using PI and PR controllers. This is done to improve the dynamic characteristics of CBRBCIS. Simulation is done for both open and closed loop CBRBIS using PIC and PRC. Simulated result obtained from the simulation reduces the total harmonic distortion of the output from the inverter by using PR controller instead of PI controller in the voltage control loop, and it maximizes the power obtained in the MPPT loop by using PR controller instead of PI controller. The hardware is powered up and tested. The simulated result is compared with the obtained hardware results. The novelty is to apply PR controller for CBRBI system to improve the dynamic response. The contribution is to combine MPPT and PR-based voltage control for CBRBIS.

AB The Maxwell stress tensor has a great significance, for example for the calculation of forces in electromagnetic energy converters, and thus is standard content of advanced lectures during electrical engineering study. However, the derivation and understanding of it is difficult and there is standard literature that is not consistent and thus increases the difficulties. In order to gain a consistent and vivid derivation of the stress tensor for use in electrical engineering lectures, two common variants are analysed from a didactic as well as scientific point of view. It is shown that one variant is consistent whereas the other one can lead to contradictions in case of materials with permeability gradients and thus is not recommended for lectures. Moreover, the resulting tensors of both variants yield different force distributions. For the consistent variant, methods for clarifying the respective force distribution for use in lectures are derived. Finally, a brief consideration on the experimental provability of the results is carried out.

AB The study of ionospheric effects(1) on the satellite-based communication signals has been a continued topic of interest both for academic interest and global positioning system aided navigation applications. These communication signals are affected by the field-aligned irregularities, suffers from fading and range spreading when they pass through the ionosphere.To study the low latitude ionospheric plasma irregularities, dedicated radar with wide beam steering capabilities is required. Recently Gadanki Ionospheric Radar Interferometer, which operates at 30 MHz frequency, has been realized at National Atmospheric Research Laboratory, Gadanki, to scan a larger part of the sky up to +/- 50 degrees in East-West direction. The radar system employs a 160 element phased antenna array, antenna system, state-of-the-art 8 kW high power solid-state transmit-receive modules, and direct digital receiver. In order to carryout round-the-clock scientific observations, highly reliable, robust designs are required to realize the high power transmit-receive modules. Detailed design philosophies are described with modular concept and better thermal designs in this paper to achieve the high power requirements. Performance results of the transmit-receive module and the sample scientific results obtained by employing these transmit-receive modules are presented in this paper.

AB Exploring the level of technological competition and its influencing factors is the basis for further understanding of technology catch-up in the latecomer countries. Faced with the uncertainty and complexity of technological development, experts rely on their accumulated knowledge and experience to judge the gap between leading technology countries, which is an important part of the evaluation of technological competitiveness. Different expert groups, work experience, and technical knowledge background have a significant impact on the judgment of technology gap, especially the overseas high-level experts will be more inclined to make conservative estimates. Therefore, we should not only pay attention to the technological competition evaluation based on experts' qualitative judgment but also improve the effectiveness of the research results by optimizing the structure of experts.

   one time finger code; one time template
AB Fingerprint-based authentication systems in general are prone to several security vulnerabilities. Authentication systems such as Biometric crypto systems, Cancellable templates and Bio-hashing provide a solution for addressing these vulnerabilities. But these systems are vulnerable to the unauthorized access resulting from the spoofed fingerprint templates by the fraudulent users. Hence, it is essential to enhance the features of the existing Biometric fingerprint-based authentication systems. An extensive research has been carried out by various researchers on the existing fingerprint authentication system techniques and it is found that none of them are fully capable of eliminating the security vulnerabilities. Fingerprint authentication system technique based on one time fingerprint template provides a solution for this by generating one time template from the fingerprint features. Although this method addresses vulnerability issues to a certain extent, improvements are highly essential particularly in terms of their security and performance. There are several systems based on finger code, where fingerprint features will be converted into finger code using a circular tessellation technique. Although authentication based on this technique improves security, the possibility of compromising the finger code is a huge threat, which needs to be addressed. In this paper, an innovative model is proposed which generates a secure one time finger code during every user authentication. It is generated using finger code obtained from minutiae vectors using a circular tessellation approach, pseudo-random number generators and timestamp, which are generated during every user transaction session. This unique encoding approach makes it extremely difficult for an unauthorized user to decode the generated finger code that is used for a particular authentication session. Thus, the possibility of compromise of original fingerprint can be avoided and thus security of biometric system can be enhanced. The proposed system also provides better performance in terms of its accuracy, processing speed and complexity.

AB Active phased array radars for the atmospheric research have various advantages such as full beam agility in 360 degrees, improved signal-to-noise ratio and improved sensitivity. These radars have distributed transmit-receive modules feeding to the individual antenna system in the antenna array field. In order to control and monitor the field-located transmit-receive modules from centralized radar controller which will be located few hundred meters away from the field, control signals plays an important role in controlling the radar subsystems. Earlier generation radars used electrical cables to transfer such type of signals, where signal speed and bandwidth are limited. In addition, the electromagnetic interference also affects the transmit and receiving signals. To overcome these problems, a new technical approach has been developed over optical interface for active phased array radar. In this paper, we present the design and development of the optical control signal network for 53 MHz active phased array radar. The design details, component selection and the link budget calculations are explained in detail and the test results are provided.

AB This study presents a modeling method for control system of multi-coupled non-linear cyber physical system with the help of second-order dynamics of communicating membrane system of neuronal population based on a population coding algorithm. Here, the communicating membrane system is modeled based on several IoT devices connected in peer to peer form and the theory of fractional differential equations is as governing function over them. Here, the difficulty is in developing a collaborative learning algorithm for finding collaborative key points within high-dimensional decision space. In order to overcome such a problem, a gradient-based method is required to enable distributed control and collaborative decision making. Here, at every interval of the sampling time, all the subsystems are optimally synchronized in P population system by multiset-rewriting rules including the effect of symport/antiport systems. This is an interesting technical problem, related to the borderline between universality and non-universality of continuity of distributed coupling of multi-coupled control system. The presented study discusses the experimental proof of the algorithmic framework and model for SLAM operation. The consensus architecture in this domain will enable the development of evolving architecture of a non-linear cyber physical system. The close loop stability and the recursive feasibility of the evolved architecture are also studied.

AB Microwave engineering is a technology-based course. Students can easily score high assessments in this course, because more of the engineering students are interested in this kind of application-oriented course. Normally, the achievement of students in this course is evaluated based on their summative assessment. Hence, the score of evaluation which obtained by the students in this course oftentimes does not match with the actual quality of the students, especially regarding their practical skill. In this paper, several simple practical assignments were proposed for undergraduate students to complete their assessment in microwave engineering course.

   consistency; test pair correlation
AB In this paper, a longitudinal study is presented about the score reliability in continuous assessment tests of the subject Network Architecture II, which is taught in the Telecommunication Technologies and Services Engineering degree, offered at Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain. It is important to evaluate if scores in tests are reliable, because it shows if the phenomenon under study is measured with precision and low error, which are necessary conditions for a fair assessment. Thus, an analysis is provided about the scores obtained in the 28 continuous assessment tests taken across seven years. Correlation, corrected correlation and Cronbach's alpha are used as psychometric indicators. Results show that, in general, there is a high correlation in the students' scores among the different assessment tests every year, which let us confirm that they have been correctly set out. Additionally, the results are compared among different years, showing that they are similar in the different cohorts. However, variations have also been observed over the years, with tests with poor correlation. Finally, based on the analysed data, a novel method is proposed to early detect problems in the tests' evaluation before the course ends, by correlating their scores in pairs. A low correlation between two tests in the same year, empirically below 0.2, would imply issues in the evaluation.

AB Presently Wireless Sensor Network used to deploy at various critical locations where heavy traffic load situations along with priority-based data routing are always occurred. Under these situations, if any Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) node wants to send the emergency data to sink/server, then that node may face harsh traffic load conditions in various routes, therefore many times end-to-end delay occurs while sending emergency data. To find the best optimized possible solution for this problem, we proposed an intelligent self-learning and educating algorithm, which uses reinforcement learning technique, shortest path algorithm along with convex-hull algorithm for creation of safe path (green corridor) to send data packets from any node to sink/server in emergency situation on priority basis. This approach is beneficial for engineers (industry/students) to better deal with real-time emergency situations and education purpose. Mainly our proposed learning algorithm selects certain WSN nodes based upon their link quality and higher residual energy to create safe path (green corridor) for emergency situation. The performance of this learning algorithm has been tested in MATLAB and Contiki Cooja simulator under heavy traffic conditions along with various performance parameters like Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) ratio, end-to-end delay, energy consumption and better throughput. Final result shows that our proposed learning algorithm Wireless Sensor Network - Reinforcement Learning (WSN-RL) performs better than existing Reinforcement Learning based lifetime optimization (RLLO) and Reinforcement Learning based Communication Range Control (RL-CRC) algorithms to achieve the optimum solution for our problem.

AB This work compares the academic performance and retention rates of women and men in electrical engineering studies. The analysis is carried out in two bachelor engineering degree programs offered in the School of Telecommunication Engineering, at the Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena, Spain: Telecommunication Systems Engineering and Telematics Engineering. Data from seven consecutive academic years have been used to compute three indicators regarding the same cohort of students: exam attendance rate, success rate, and performance rate. The results show that, in general, women obtain better academic performance rates than men in the first two academic courses while, from the third course on, there seems to be a trend toward uniformity in the academic results between female and male students. Furthermore, women generally present lower attrition rates than men, especially in the first year, and better graduation rates. Such facts could be explained by the higher motivation of female students when enrolling engineering programs-due to the adverse stereotyped context that they have to overcome-which lead to higher retention rates throughout the academic years as compared to their male counterparts.

The software, called Power Systems Platform from the Federal University of Uberlandia (PSP-UFU), has as its goal to aid in the areas of research and education. Through an interface aligned with the CAD tool, the construction of any electric network and control system is permitted by the directing of visual elements. Standard software architecture was used in the development of the platform, as well as standardisation and documentation, which are necessary practices for an understanding into the source code and software development by third parties. The software possesses an excellent computational performance and a friendly and intuitive interface, which all go on to make it ideal for educational applications in electric power systems.

AB With the development of artificial intelligence technology and big data technology, the multi-attribute negotiation contract with complex dependencies among the multiple attributes, named "complex contract negotiation", shows greater value for academic research and applications. Based on the perspective of negotiator's utility information protection, the study is aimed at investigating the characteristics underlying complex contract negotiation, using hybrid artificial intelligence technology, and developing a bilateral negotiation model for complex contracts based on the negotiators' utility information protection. The study provides a method for approximating Pareto optimal solution in a certain precision range. And an example is used to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the method by the bilateral negotiation simulation in the price and quality. The research provides a new approach for multi-attribute automatic negotiation.

AB The paper presents an innovative experimental setup that can show the wave-particle duality of light. A new experimental class for teaching light wave-particle duality concept based on the presented setup is also designed for undergraduates who major in Optics. Based on optical radiation pressure theory, the three-dimensional space trapping, localization, and movement of the particles reveal the particle property of light. Based on the beam interferometry technology, the recording and detection of the dual beam interference signal verify the wave property of light. The presented setup employs fiber optical light path, enabling the setup to be resistant to external interference, easy to assemble and move, and low in cost. The presented experimental practice can give students more opportunities to broaden and deepen their understanding of the taught subject content, while using modern experimental instruments and working on problems. During the class, students can know how to use optical instruments in a proper way, understand light wave-particle duality and related concepts, and increase awareness and curiosity of related cutting-edge scientific research. According to the class questionnaire survey, students were satisfied with the practical experimental class.

AB Cognitive radio network explores the framework for energy harvesting and derives effective algorithms such as Nash Equilibrium re-Optimization, Greedy one-slot Game, and Bi Layer re Game. The stability of data queue for energy harvesting cognitive radio network was analyzed by optimization of primary users and noncooperative game of secondary users with Nash equilibrium of stochastic Stackelberg game in a bilevel manner. The proposed work considers the effective data queue stability for secondary user in a cognitive radio network with the necessary conditions such as data arrival, energy arrival, transmission success probability, and expected transmission steady-state delay to make the data queue stable. The queue needs to be stabilized for online algorithm Greedy one-slot Game and offline algorithm Bi Layer re Game. The simulations show the relevance of queue stability by finding the average queue delay and average queue size by comparing both the algorithms.

AB With the rapid development of advanced technologies such as big data, Internet of Things and cloud computing, the rebuilding of physical education environment platform is becoming more and more urgent. Through an analysis of the various roles within the classroom, we find that altering the traditional teacher-centered class hierarchy and developing a student-centered and interactive study mechanism for physical education teaching provide a number of good suggestions for college teaching reform. In this paper, a support environment developed for teaching and research in Physical Education is proposed that is based on emerging information technologies such as the Internet of Things and multimedia technology. The study suggests that the proposed solution for supporting an environment that encourages the development of such teaching and research methods for physical education is feasible.

DE Artificial zero passage; superconducting current limiting; vacuum
   circuit break; dielectric recovery
AB In order to research influences of di/dt on breaking capacity of vacuum switch in the process of direct-current interruption at the time of clearance between open contacts, arc time, and current zero, recovery strength of intrinsic dielectric after breaking of vacuum switch was measured, which is free recovery process of contact clearance dielectric without applying recovery voltage. A short-term dielectric recovery property of breaking for artificial zero current-limiting vacuum circuit breaker was proposed in this study. The breaker comprises superconducting current limiting module and direct-current zero passage breaking module. Breaking feasibility of the superconducting current-limiting direct-current breaker under different nominal voltage was researched. There is a critical separation in the breaking process of direct current under the test condition. Faster breaking speed and shorter arc time were selected in the scope of separation so as to improve the recovery strength of intrinsic dielectric for electrode gap after current zero passage. Lower inverse current zero passage frequency was selected under the same separation and the same arc time so as to improve the recovery strength of intrinsic dielectric after current zero passage.

AB A mean-robustness stochastic programming model is developed for a p-hub median problem to balance the overall system efficiency and robustness under demand and cost uncertainties. A solution algorithm based on scenario decomposition is designed to overcome computational challenges brought by the large size of the problem. The proposed modeling and computing methods are tested in the case study using a real-world China aviation dataset. The result shows the effect of our algorithm and the importance of adopting mean-robustness by the comparison over expectation model and deterministic model.

AB The power generated from the optoelectric source in the conversion system and the connected system should satisfy several factors such as high efficiency, less total harmonic distortion, reduced cost, less complexity, better boosting capability, etc. The boosting capability can be achieved by means of single juncture or two juncture architecture in DC-DC boost converter. Among different architecture, the Z-source riven bias inverter controls the parameter on the AC and DC sections. The steady state quantity and the time-varying parameter are regulated by controlling the intonation index. The modulation indexes are framed by digital to look at its supervision theme in grid coupled structure that has certainly not been studied so far. Hence, in this paper, the Z-source riven bias electrical converter modeling has been studied in conjunction with the decoupled space vector modulation as a control technique. The deliberate theme is studied and simulated by using a MATLAB/Simulink model to approve the analysis and simulations.

ID APOPTOSIS
AB In this paper, the highly immunogenic genes Ag85b, Rv3872, CFP10, and ESAT6 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were expressed tandemly and integrated into the carrier pTIC6a, and the recombinant plasmid was transformed into BCG and the Mycobacterium smegmatis (M.S.) by means of electric transformation to obtain the recombinant BCG (rBCG) and recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis (rM.S.). The recombinant bacteria mice. The mice's serum antibody, splenocyte proliferation ability, and level of secretion of interferon-gamma and interleukin-4 in the splenocyte-stimulating supernatant 10 weeks after immunization were detected. The results showed that the serum antibodies and proliferative ability of spleen cells of mice in rBCG group were significantly higher than that of the ones in BCG group since the fourth week after immunization, and the IFN-gamma secretion in rBCG group was higher than that in BCG group 10 weeks after immunization, and the difference was significant (P = 0.022). The above results showed that rBCG could induce higher cellular and humoral immune response at the same time and had a more promising application. Although rM.S. vaccine can stimulate the immune response of the organism to some extent, the intensity and persistence of the immune response are inferior to that of BCG and rBCG.

AB Nano aluminum/titanium oxide spraying process was explored and the mechanical properties were studied. Atmosphere plasma spraying method was used for preparing aluminum/titanium oxide ceramic coating with nano structure, and fixing spraying current, spraying distance and powder feeder rotation speed. Four groups of hot spraying specimens with different processes were prepared by adjusting the main air pressure and spraying voltage, which optimized the preparation process. The bonding strength, microstructure, hardness, fracture toughness, cupping property and thermal shock resistance after optimization were represented, and the friction and wear performances of nano ceramic coating in the ball disc mode were also represented. The optimal nano ceramic coating was AT13, which was determined by the microstructure hardness, crack resistance and fracture toughness data of coating. Nano ceramic coating had higher bonding strength and hardness, and nano tissue of original powder inherited excellent cupping resistance of nano coating, so the toughness is obviously better than that of traditional micron coating. After water quenching cycle test at 400 degrees C for 50 times, the coating did not lose efficacy at all. In the ball disc friction wear under high load, the wear extent of nano ceramic coating is low, and the friction coefficient is stable, which shows good wear resistance. Nano aluminum oxide ceramic coating has high bonding strength, excellent cupping performance, wear resistance, good comprehensive mechanical properties, so it could be used for rigid working environment.

ID WIND POWER; ENERGY
AB This article presents a new protection scheme for the mu grid structure is implemented on low voltage side as DC system's protection methods are quite new when compared to the AC systems. The protection system designed in AC system faces many difficulties like frequency matching, reactive power violation, and instability. The main objective of the proposed system is to eliminate the faulty segment promptly while keeping the healthy segments functioning unaltered. In the proposed method, a unitwise controller is designed and is connected in feedback so as to maintain stability under all conditions. The unitwise controller comprises primary and secondary controllers which continually monitor all the units of DC grid comprising semiconductor bidirectional switches and snubber circuits. A primary controller is used for monitoring the complete variation in the parameters in all the units. If the observed parameter value is greater than the acceptable range, the secondary controllers receive the command so as to take the required action to eliminate the faulty segment. Both lines and ground faults are tested on all the sections separately and also simultaneously. The tested results are analyzed in all aspects and the results of the states that the designed protection scheme competent in isolating the defective segment within a short period of time. Once the defective segment is isolated, the other segments retain the stabilized voltage and current limits. The protection scheme is designed and verified using MATLAB/Simulink.

The magnetic gear effect of the modulation rotor realizes the removal of the brush and slip ring, and makes the DMPEM to be brushless. By using Halbach permanent magnet arrays, the coupling effect between the inner and outer magnetic fields is effectively reduced, which can improve the efficiency. In this research, the work principle and the structure of the Halbach Brushless Modulation Dual Mechanical Port Electrical Machine (HBM-DMPEM) are researched and analyzed in theory. The two-dimensional finite element models of the HBM-DMPEM under different magnetization methods are created. The magnetic field distribution and the torque transfer characteristics are quantitatively analyzed with the finite element method. The results of analysis and research show that the HBM-DMPEM has stronger torque output capacity and lower torque fluctuation due to the Halbach permanent magnet arrays.

AB Existing recommendation systems lack to address the need of several problems in education domain due to the availability of limited information. Study of recommendation systems to facilitate students' education in their relevant services is being carried out in different perspective. Hence, the objective of this work is to apply existing knowledge for decision making to recommend students during their course registration process in an institution. The situation where more number of experts involves in decision making was influenced by Fuzzy Soft Expert Set (FSES). This work emphasizes the application of FSES for facilitating students' course registration process assuming that the same course is offered by more number of faculty members during a semester. As more number of experts involved in this process and the uncertainty of the available data, using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) along with FSES was considered. A new methodology FSES-TOPSIS was also applied in this work. The proposed method was accurate enough to enable students to rank the faculty members based on their previous performance and to enroll themselves with the faculty members of their interest. The method proposed here can be extended for various problems of similar nature.

AB This work analyzes the impact of admission grade point average (AGPA) on academic results of electrical engineering university students throughout their undergraduate studies. The analysis was carried out on two bachelor engineering degree programs offered at the School of Telecommunication Engineering at the Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena, Spain: Telecommunication Systems Engineering and Telematics Engineering. Data from seven consecutive academic years were used to compute three indicators regarding the same cohort of students: exam attendance rate, success rate, and performance rate. The results show that although there exists a significant correlation between AGPA and student performance, it is truly relevant only in the first two academic courses (in this work, a course is assumed to be the compilation of all subjects in a year). In view of the results, a set of guidelines is proposed in order to soften the impact of AGPA on the progress of university students.

AB Probability and random processes is considered by students to be conceptually one of the most difficult subjects in the undergraduate electrical and computer engineering curriculum. There are numerous reasons for this difficulty encountered by the students. First off, humans are not innately good at probabilistic intuition. Traditionally, this subject has been introduced in a very abstract manner without emphasis on real-world applications from electrical and computer engineering discipline. In addition, extensive use of interactive simulation and visualization tools, offering an alternative way of developing probabilistic intuition, is usually missing from traditional course offerings. This paper presents a unique pedagogical approach to teaching an introductory probability course offered to electrical and computer engineering juniors. The salient features of the proposed pedagogical approach include more emphasis on real-world electrical and computer engineering problems that show the applications of abstract probabilistic concepts; extensive hands-on and interactive MATLAB (R) simulations of real-world electrical and computer engineering problems that are tightly integrated into the curriculum; highlighting the frequentist approach to build probabilistic intuition using simulations; concrete examples showing how naive probabilistic intuition can be erroneous and how to develop correct probabilistic intuition based on systematically modeling, simulating, and analyzing a problem; and application-based simulations driving the abstract theory rather than the other way around. This pedagogical approach was implemented in a course offered to electrical and computer engineering undergraduates at Purdue University Northwest. The paper presents a concrete example illustrating how the salient features of the proposed pedagogical approach were implemented as part of this course and student data from the courses to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

AB In this paper, an alternative to the traditional methodology related to signal processing-like subjects is proposed. These are subjects that require a deep mathematical and theoretical basis, but the practical goal is not often emphasized, which drives students to lose interest in the subject. Thus, a software-defined radio environment is proposed to provide a more practical view of the subject. This solution consists of an open hardware-software platform able to capture and process a wide range of frequencies. HackRF is the hardware component, while GNU Radio will provide the graphical support to this device. The tests performed with a set of 36 students have revealed that they are more satisfied with this framework than just employing a traditional equation-based environment as Matlab. Furthermore, their scores in the exams also support the suitability of the proposed platform.

AB This research designed a DC motor control system experiments and developed a platform for on-line implementation of these experiments. This was with a view to contributing to the number of online laboratory experiments while providing a common platform for other on-line users. In this research, three experiments were designed using LabVIEW software. The developed platform is implemented online using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology interactive laboratory architecture. The control system performance was then evaluated by administering questionnaires to users with the aim of eliciting information on the ease of use of the operating system. The successful control of the DC motor and integration of the experiment engines into the iLab Interactive architecture were achieved. In conclusion, the online DC motor control laboratory was deployed and provided ready access to a DC motor control over the Internet with beginner and intermediate-level experiments in the field of control system and engineering

AB Internet of things is emerging in the recent years and is changing many traditional industries in the recent years. Engineering students of several knowledge areas may benefit with the introduction of internet of things concepts in the undergraduate courses, since there is an increasingly need of professionals to work in multidisciplinary teams. This paper proposes an undergraduate course to teach internet of things concepts for engineering students using cooperative problem-based learning (CPBL). The students have to develop a project using different internet of things technologies: sensing and actuation, embedded computing, communication and networking, cloud computing, and data analytics. The proposed course may help students to improve not only their technical skills but also soft skills, such as teamwork, communication and creativity. The developed projects achieved good results, and positive feedback was received from the students. Students from engineering courses related to internet of things had a better performance than students of no internet of things-related courses.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Power consumption plays a significant role in any integrated circuit. In this study, an explicit type pulse trigger flip-flop is implemented using the CMOS 90 nm technology. For low-power dissipation, 1 V supply will optimize the size of gate terminal. This explicit type flip-flop uses an explicit source for pulse generation, that is, the double edge-triggered pulse generator, which requires half of clock frequency compared to the single edge-triggered pulse generator. The proposed new double edge-triggered pulse generator uses the pulse generation logic, which is used to share many numbers of flip-flop results at low power. In this article, circuits with low power, low heat generation, and increased durability are achieved.

AB The Internet of things (IoT) is the next technological revolution that includes many industries and applications. IoT can offer solutions for many problems. However, it requires many skills from different disciplines that current electrical and computer engineers lack. In order to encourage the seamless internalization of the IoT and the technologies it supports, a new method should be considered in training electrical and computer engineers. The new methods should focus on applications and projects that involve the use of components such as hardware, software, and cloud platforms that are available in the market rather than class oriented theories. In this study, we introduce a methodology for teaching an IoT systems course that will encourage students to study how to develop and accomplish IoT applications in real time, at a reasonable cost, and for general use rather than meeting the detailed needs of one merchant. We exploit universally available open source software and cloud platforms to enhance teaching IoT course. The proposed course is taught at the undergraduate level in the computer engineering departments of Kocaeli and Sakarya Universities in Turkey. The results show that the designed method can have a constructive influence on the progress of computer engineering education by timely and positive assistance in educating the new IoT engineers.

AB A complementary methodology to the teaching of photovoltaic systems is proposed where students can develop a complete project if they were immersed in the industry. The complementary strategy incorporates activities usually not taught which are delivered via web-classroom to develop and reinforce the abilities needed to face the industry once they are graduated. A project-based learning strategy is used to reinforce the teaching on sizing, planning, modeling, installations with international standards, the start-up of a photovoltaic system with a monitoring system. Students carry out a financial investment analysis rarely taught, such as the calculation of the payback period, the internal rate of return and the net present value are made to ensure the project viability. Planning-dimensioning usually is taught analyzing the electrical bill to determine the required sizing capacity without considering the building installed capacity. A three-dimensional dimensioning using the geographic location of a possible installation is proposed to provide better information in terms of losses due to shading or obstacles that may affect an installation. Furthermore, it is proposed to perform an analysis of mechanical stresses on the mounting rail system under natural phenomena such as hurricanes. This type of analysis is not usually taught in classes and it is important since an investment can be lost due to natural phenomena as has already occurred in some solar plants. The proposed activities are aimed to develop self-directed learning skills motivating to do research leading to problem-solving and meaningful activities to work autonomously in a natural and real-life situation. This approach allows the teacher and students to ponder deeply about worthy subjects and issues. Five questions were formulated to verify student satisfaction; the 30 surveyed students have a very positive view of this complementary utilized strategy.

AB This article describes experiences of teaching object-oriented programming to undergraduate Electrical Engineering students. The proposed project-based methodology increased the interest of students in programming. The project focuses on the development of a small C++ class that allows students to build geometric models by manipulating a three-dimensional matrix. The class methods (C++ member functions) can draw complex scenes by using combinations of them. Students can improve their programming skills according to the points of view of a class developer and a class user. In addition, students try to create beautiful models to present to each other, making the learning experience pleasant and motivating.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION

DE Active learning; flipped classroom; universal software radio peripheral;
   GNU Radio; amplitude modulation double sideband suppressed carrier
AB One of the great challenges of engineering education is bringing theory closer to practical applications. The team-based learning methodology, which uses the flipped classroom concept, is actively centred on the student. The students study a conceptual material independently before it is covered in the classroom. After that, they spend a considerable amount of time working in groups in the classroom solving problems with conceptual application of the material studied. The last stage of team-based learning is the application of course concepts. However, in the telecommunications field, the high cost of equipment for practical development in educational institutions is a big barrier. Moreover, the equipment used is traditionally dedicated to a single activity. In order to solve this problem and apply all the team-based learning stages in telecommunications engineering teaching, this paper presents a proposal of an adaptation of this methodology using a software-defined radio set using the universal software radio peripheral hardware and the GNU Radio software. This set offers flexible functionalities and low cost. Finally, we show the proposal for each team-based learning stage in the learning process of the amplitude modulator and demodulator - double sideband suppressed carrier relating concepts to practical applications.

AB Using breakout physical computing toolkits, such as Arduino, has become a common practice of both engineers and non-engineers alike. While these development platforms solve many low-level challenges, getting started with embedded system prototyping may seem overwhelming for novices. Choosing novice friendly sensors can make a substantial difference. In this paper, a framework for selecting sensors for novice use is presented and accessibility obstacles are defined. Six learning barriers in end-user programming are adopted for evaluating obstacles effecting on novice usability. Four properties for evaluating sensors and to overcome the barriers are presented: protocol complexity, connection type and component size, understandable real-life phenomena measured and documentation. Sensor protocol complexity and documentation are identified as key factors affecting implementation challenges.

AB The continual growth of antenna-based technologies has created an exponential demand for well-qualified workforce of antenna engineer/researchers, but the expertise for a smooth transition into job market is lagging. This study presents the effectiveness of using hybrid-flipped model integrated with educational technologies in a graduate Antenna Theory and Design course, and the influence it has on orienting students toward antenna research. This is important because graduate research in emerging technologies with good results will open the gateway for job and the prospect of a scholarship for higher education. The effectiveness of the proposed study is evaluated using the following metrics: (a) student response to the hybrid-flipped learning, (b) impact of educational technology on student learning, and (c) educational outcome toward antenna engineering research. Result of the study indicates that the number of students choosing antenna research increased from 14% in 2014-15 to 42% in 2015-16 and reaching to 70% in 2016-17, and the number of students for year 2017-18 is 77% Results of the study also reflect research in diverse antenna technologies with good research output to merit publication in journals of international repute.

AB Flipped classroom is an emerging course delivery method, where the traditional in-class and out-of-class activities flip places. The lectures are given out-of-class with electronic resources and in-class time is reserved for group activities and discussion with the instructor. In this study, we present our implementation of a flipped classroom in a senior level undergraduate engineering course. An extensive perception analysis was carried out with anonymous surveys and face-to-face interviews with students. Performance analysis of the flipped class was carried out by comparing the achievement level in the course learning outcomes of previous years' traditional classes and recent year's flipped class. The out-of-class lectures were implemented as machine-voice-narrated presentations. The effect of machine voice on the flipped classroom is also examined. Students' perception and reaction to various aspects of the flipped class are documented. Performance analysis showed a significant improvement in one category of course learning outcomes. Student perception was positive overall.

AB Subjects related to electromagnetics in undergraduate electrical engineering courses are normally seen as problematic by students, due to the inherent complexity and abstract concepts. The effect is that students are drawn away from related research areas. Some approaches were developed to enhance the motivation and physical insight of the concepts seen in class. Electromagnetic compatibility is used as a source of real world examples where students see that applied electromagnetics is not a field unrelated with their experiences. In addition to that, final projects with handmade antennas help guide students through a complete design cycle, from analytical formulation to the actual measurement, so that the connections concerning the theory, simulation, prototyping, and measurements are closed. These techniques were applied and provided good results, increasing the understanding and motivation among students toward radio-frequency and antenna-related areas.

TI A pedagogical case on active learning regarding to Kirchhoff's circuit

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION

DE Kirchhoff's circuit laws; resistor network; active learning;
   questionnaire
AB Kirchhoff's circuit laws are important basic concepts in many basic disciplines, such as electricity and circuitry. However, in the usual teaching process, teachers often teach this knowledge using some simple examples of analysis and calculation but without deep discussions. As a result, students could not have a deep understanding about these concepts or not apply the concepts on actual problems flexibly. Therefore, passive learning habits are formed. The lack of self-exploration awareness and comprehensive ability would result in a poor learning effect. This paper designs a specific application scene of Kirchhoff's circuit laws using a multi-channel resistor network. With this application, students can construct the knowledge system autonomously, find the problems proactively, solve the problems timely, and combine the research-based autonomous learning with extracurricular open mutual learning; so, their active learning ability will be promoted to a large extent. Compared with the past teaching methods, this pedagogical case highlights the following advantages of active learning. Firstly, it highlights the process of guiding students to study the object from a small-scale resistor network to a complex and large-scale multi-channel resistor network. Secondly, it embodies the concrete application of calculus knowledge in various basic courses with the help of perfect mathematical deduction. Thirdly, it exercises students' programming ability by using MATLAB to numerically simulate theoretical results. Finally, this case practices students' hands-on experimental ability by constructing real resistor circuits and verifying the theory and simulation results. In addition, we get good feedback from students on the teaching effect through the questionnaire survey.

AB During the last decade, students of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and mechatronics have been interested in studying robotics. It is a challenge for robotics course professors to get students to clearly understand the basic theoretical concepts for its correct application to solve problems, and to motivate them to achieve the best performance. Previous works proposed the use of 3D models to perform the simulation of industrial robots in class and consequently to reinforce the students' theoretical and practical concepts. However, it has not yet been clearly demonstrated how the use of robots and simulations helps improve students' academic performance. In this paper, the main contribution consists of a formal evaluation in which the comparison between the use of two teaching methods was carried out. In the first teaching method (traditional method), the professor used PowerPoint presentations and oral explanations to teach theoretical concepts and solve exercises (Group A). In the second teaching method, the professor added the use of 3D simulations together with the traditional method to teach theoretical concepts and solve exercises (Group B). Students of both groups performed the same written exam about forward kinematics in order to study and analyse the differences between the methodology used with Group A and the methodology used with Group B. This exam consisted of solving three exercises with different robot complexity levels. The results demonstrate that the performance of the students in group B is significantly better than that of the students in group A. In other words, the use of 3D simulations improves student's academic performance, and provides a teaching tool to enhance the way the professors teach.

AB Considering the effectiveness of outcome-based education and its increasing implementation in higher education, we propose a set of course learning outcomes that may be related to any engineering problem, in particular the final year project in undergraduate engineering programs. We also show how these outcomes may be mapped to program learning outcomes identified by the Washington Accord. Our case study is an embedded vision system developed by our own group, which we assess against these outcomes using the proposed self-assessment report rubrics. We conclude by presenting assessment reports for our project from two expert academics showing how well it managed to attain the course learning outcomes. This work is intended to give students a direction to professionally as well as ethically approach a particular design problem, and at the same time help the instructors evaluate their students' projects by simply adopting the proposed assessment methodology.

AB State estimation is one of the most important processes to perform a reliable monitoring and control of the steady-state operating condition of modern electric power systems; thus, it is currently a fundamental part in the development of research to enhance the monitoring and security of the smart grids operation. This important topic is taught in advanced courses of operation and control of power systems, for graduate and undergraduate power engineering students. However, the most used software packages for simulation and analysis of power systems by researchers, students, and educators have put little attention on the state estimation module. Due to this fact, this paper proposes an approach to develop the computational implementation of a practical educational tool for state estimation of electric power systems using the MATLAB optimization toolbox. In this proposal, the formulation of the state estimation problem consists of developing a general digital code to implement an objective function based on the weighted least squares method. While the lsqnonlin function of the MATLAB optimization toolbox solves the formulated state estimation problem. Simplifying both research and educational processes, this tool helps graduate and undergraduate students to improve learning, understanding, and the times of implementation and development of research in state estimation. Simulations of an equivalent model of the Mexican interconnected power system consisting of 190 buses and 46 machines are used to test and validate the proposal performance.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of supervisor support and working conditions on job satisfaction among teaching faculty in private engineering colleges. The study on job satisfaction has greater importance with the passage of time because of its nature and impact on the faculty and society. The researcher administered a standardized questionnaire on 180 individual respondents to collect the data. Respondents filled the items manually with their characteristics: age, gender, qualification, work experience, and their job position to check their level of significance with the job satisfaction. Descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analysis were used for the data analysis. Based on the statistical findings, supervisor support and working conditions have a significant positive relationship with job satisfaction. These findings extend the theoretical understanding of supervisor support and work environment which enhance the faculty job satisfaction. Results also urge colleges and higher educational institutions to understand and to emphasize the importance of the work environment, which has an impact on faculty job satisfaction.

AB The Smart-Grid approach, as a paramount worldwide issue, is a paradigm shift from the traditional way energy is produced, distributed, and used. It implies a complex multidisciplinary panorama which includes ongoing subjects for which traditional electrical and computer engineers are not entirely ready. As the implementation of Smart-Grid is imminent, high-skilled professionals are needed to absorb the research, labor, business, logistics, and innovation issues of today and tomorrow. This leads to a transformation of the education role for undergraduate programs which is now, accordingly, urged to build up students' research skills. In this paper, a case study is presented to introduce and asses a new teaching/evaluation methodology intended to build critical thinking, objectivity, and ingenuity among mechanical-electrical undergraduate students during a one-semester course on Smart-Grid. The results show that the proposed technique may improve the aforementioned research skills within the group of students. Overall, the proposed methodology can be used as a protocol to guide new research cases and to frame similar educational proposals.

AB The control of industrial processes is an important theme covered by electrical engineering courses. The implementation of practical activities in laboratories with physical systems and devices complements the theory about control and automation addressed in lectures and enables apprentices to face real situations and problems present in industrial environments. This paper discusses the use of a didactic pilot plant by the students of University of Sao Paulo in an electrical engineering undergraduate discipline based on the project-based learning approach. The students performed simultaneous experiments with the following control systems: water temperature in the plant, water level in two reservoirs, and water flow rate through the plant, and also monitored the variables of the processes through a supervisory system. The answers of a questionnaire applied to the students after each project and the results registered in technical reports illustrate their performance in the discipline and provide a positive feedback on the use of the industrial plant as a didactic tool.

   input-output parameters estimation
AB Parameter estimation of the nonlinear electronic schemes, including inductances, capacitances, resistances, and switches represents a nontrivial problem in the "power electronics" and "electrical drives" courses. Difficulties could be observed during solutions of electrical circuits, which describe the behavior of electric motors in drives, and various electronic appliances are being used in power electronics. This situation is a result of complicated analytical approaches aiming to solve nonlinear ordinary differential equations describing the occurring processes. A typical student has a significant problem in attaining the analytical results. Various methods of linearization nonlinear elements permitting to obtain roughly analytical solutions and simplified solution were applied over the past. Nowadays, coarsely obtained results are not acceptable as a rule. As a result, smart simulation based on PSIM, MATLAB Simulink, and WOLFRAM Mathematica giving excellent opportunity for accurate answers are recommended. All software programs represent undoubtedly important and extremely accurate approaches. However, only numerical results are provided and are not capable of solution's generalization. It seems that in the Power Electronics and Electrical Drives courses, a wide submission could obtain methods of numerical nomograms with dimensionless representation of input-output parameters. Dimensionless approach allows significant diminishing of a number of decisive parameters and simplifies calculation, whereas keeping acceptable precision of results, as well as a possibility of outcome's generalization and representation variables trends in a wide range of input parameters. The likely objects of analysis may be, for example, output characteristics of DC motors fed by controllable and uncontrollable n-phase rectifiers, resistive rectifier losses and motor's efficiency, average and root mean square currents or voltages in electronic circuits, total harmonic distortion, and others. Long-time practice of these approaches approved their usefulness, productivity, and helpfulness.

DE Undergraduate research; moisture meter; electrical resistance;
   electrical test equipment; laboratories; nonmajors
AB Concepts from electrical engineering can be introduced to nonmajor engineering students through lectures, laboratories, or even research experiences. Often the purpose of introducing nonmajors to these concepts is to highlight that engineering problems are not limited to skills from only a single discipline as well as improve their ability to communicate and collaborate with other disciplines. This case study discusses the experience of introducing a nonmajor undergraduate student to electrical engineering through an undergraduate research project at The University of Alabama investigating the electrical properties of bamboo, which required the characterization of a portable moisture meter. These exercises were successful at improving the student's confidence and proficiency with electrical test equipment, highlighting the limitations of test equipment, and applying concepts of resistance to a real-world application that overlaps electrical, chemical, and biological disciplines. While this exercise was a component of an undergraduate research experience, similar exercises could be easily integrated into electrical engineering laboratories for nonelectrical engineering majors to introduce and reinforce concepts from electrical engineering using a multidisciplinary application.

AB A novel approach to computer simulator development of microwave measurement equipment is presented. The main feature of the software is an interface of the simulator, which is an interactive image of the real equipment allowing to manipulate the keys and other elements of the front panel by the computer mouse. For the measurement procedure, the simulator allows to use analytical formulas or upload the data from the computer models of the microwave devices and from the real measurements in *.s2p format. Implementation of the developed simulator into the educational process provides each student with an unlimited access to the measuring equipment and gives the opportunity not only to study the characteristics of microwave devices but also to gain experience with the real equipment due to interactive computer interface that is completely identical to real front panel.

ID SYSTEM
AB Signal de-noising is one of the major topics of engineering application covered in an undergraduate-level digital signal processing course. Generally speaking, it involves a number of tedious concepts that have intrinsic physical meaning, which is difficult for students to understand . In this paper, an educational method using diaphragmatic electromyographic (EMGdi) as the de-noising object, which runs on the MATLAB software, has been developed for the convenience of learning and understanding for three-years students in digital signal processing course. This method transforms the analog filter to a digital filter by applying bilinear transformation equations, which allows the students explore the various characteristics of digital filter, such as low pass filter, high pass filter, band pass filter and band stop filter. That means Laplace equation transformed by inductance, capacitance and resistance will be replaced by the z equation, which is used for deriving sequence of difference equations. In the case studies, the clinical EMGdi is used to show the features of the developed method. Furthermore, classroom experience in the Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University has shown that the developed method helps in consolidating a better understanding of signal de-noising processing in digital signal processing course.

DE Distance education; remote lab; measurement; practical work; electrical

AB e-Learning emerged as a way for enhancing the quality of education and providing accessible distance learning to allow learners to study beyond regular class time, transcending the mandatory presence of teachers and the availability of classrooms by providing the necessary resources and services. One of the main issues of e-learning, especially in engineering education, is the lack of online educational laboratories. Practical work remains a considerable burden as engineering educational programs focus on handling real equipment. These last are only accessible within a restrictive schedule and might be unaffordable for low budget institutions. The need is clear for interactive platforms that enhance the motivation and controls the regulation of workload for each student. In this paper, an overview about online laboratories is given and a simple approach of remote lab is suggested. The proposal of our research team (Team SEITI) can be used for carrying-out experiments that require neither assembly nor physical changes until the results are obtained unless a technician, that must be present in the laboratory, acts on equipment. The idea is to set up a real-time measurement retrieval laboratory that requires the involvement of a technician to act on instruments and will grant access to a large scale of students.

AB The purpose of this research was to study the impact of project-based learning and information and communication technologies on students' motivation. Two second-year classes in electrical engineering at the University Tahri Mohamed in Bechar, Algeria, were involved in the study. The experiment compared the level to which one class of students mastered goals without the use of information and communication technologies, to the mastery achieved by a second class which participated in a tutorial that has a technological tool built into the project-based approach. The subject of power electronics was chosen for this study because of its different knowledge, which is strongly represented in difficult learning contents for students.
   A questionnaire about motivation was used to collect data within an experimental research plan. After three months of conducting the study, the results demonstrated that the integration of the tutorial with the project-based approach is likely to increase students' motivation to learn and to master the subject of power electronics.

ID INTRODUCTORY COURSE
AB This paper presents learning and teaching experiences gathered from an induction program conducted at the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka for newly enrolled undergraduate students. The induction program, named as the pre-academic term, was an experimental effort to explore the applicability of blended leaning concepts to enhance the learning experience of Engineering freshmen, while enabling smooth transition from high school to university education. In addition to standard lectures, an integral part of the program was in-class demonstrations, where electronic circuits were assembled from scratch on a printed circuit board and demonstrated using a projected camera during the lectures. Organization, learning objectives, brief description of the example projects are presented along with a summary of formal student feedback. More than 85% of the freshmen indicated that the induction program helped them to smoothly begin the university education. A qualitative assessment in the laboratory work indicated that about 98% of the students successfully completed the assigned hands-on activities.

DE Learning; programming language; pre-knowledge; motivation; emotions
AB Today, it is believed that it is difficult to learn a programming language because it requires a completely different way of thinking from what students are accustomed to and need a lot of work and time to start thinking in this way. Each method for learning a programming language aims to improve the quality of learning, which is confirmed by a large number of successful students. This paper presents the influence of factors such as motivation, emotion and pre-knowledge of students on the choice of method, which is maximally adapted to the age, abilities and preferences of students. Adequate selection of the method is done by using the tests for checking the given factors to the students' data, which are later used to select the most favorable method for learning a programming language.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of problem-based and lecture-based learning environments on students' achievement in electronic works. The design was randomized subjects with pretest and posttest control group design. The participants (N=148) were randomized to treatment and control conditions. Repeated measures analysis of variance and univariate analysis of variance were conducted by the researchers to compare changes across the treatment and control group participants. To test for differences in categorical data representing characteristics of the participants, the researchers used Chi-square (chi(2)) statistic. Results show that the experimental group achieved higher achievement scores than the control group for electronic works achievement test at the posttest and follow-up test stages. Furthermore, the study found that there was no significant difference (P>0.05) in the achievement of students in the different ability levels and genders after the treatment. Hence, problem-based learning was advocated for teachers of electronic works in Nigeria.

   meter
AB Capacitive proximity sensors are well-suited for educational projects due to their low cost and simple design. Traditional undergraduate textbooks and lab exercises rarely highlight the fact that the performance of capacitive proximity sensors can be quite sensitive to ground loading. This paper presents a simple classroom demonstration for exploring this topic in detail. The capacitive proximity sensor for this demonstration is a hand-held LCR meter connected to a homemade capacitor composed of two strips of aluminum foil. Students explore the operation of this sensor for two different system ground configurations. In the first case the LCR meter is battery powered (floating ground referenced) and in the second case the LCR meter is powered by AC mains supply (earth ground referenced). When a student positions their hand near the foil strips, the battery-powered sensor measures an increase in capacitance. Conversely, the AC-mains-powered sensor measures a decrease in capacitance. The instructor guides students to discover for themselves the reason for this seemingly puzzling difference by modeling parasitic capacitance and ground loading using simple circuit models.

ID ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS; CURRICULUM; DIFFICULTY; PHYSICS; MODELS
AB The wye-to-delta (Y-Delta) transformation is part of every circuit analysis course. In electric circuits textbooks, the transformation is found by comparing the two networks and making sure that the resistance between each pair of nodes in one network is the same as the resistance between the same pair of nodes in the other network. The two networks are compared as open-circuit networks. This creates confusion among students because usually the network is part of a larger closedcircuit network. In this paper, an alternative method is proposed. The new method starts from one configuration and finds the corresponding equivalent configuration by deriving currents and voltages, as part of a closed circuit. This method can be adopted in circuit analysis courses to help students develop a deeper understanding of this topic.

AB Student-supervisor cooperation was carried out to design the inter-subject final year project reported in this paper. According to the student feedback, this approach allowed gathering his main interests - vector control, microcontroller programming and wind power generation - together, therefore reinforcing his motivation towards his final year project and making him feel particularly responsible for its outcome. Microcontroller-based hardware-in-the-loop emulation made possible to combine the three afore-cited student interests. In this context, the virtual prototype of a current-controlled wind turbine-driven 2-MW permanent-magnet synchronous generator is presented, along with the pseudo-code corresponding to the permanent-magnet synchronous generator speed control algorithm programmed in an 8-bit microcontroller. In addition, tuning formulas are derived for the digital integral-proportional controllers commanding both the permanent-magnet synchronous generator current and speed. Detailed descriptions are provided in order to guarantee reproducibility. Implementation of the hardware-in-the-loop rig is also tackled, supported by illustrative results obtained when running it. The developed hardware-in-the-loop rig is considered suitable for laboratory practices of subjects like digital control and microcontroller programming.

AB The industrial field trip in the introduction to engineering has been integrated into the engineering education program at Hung Yen University of Technology and Education, Vietnam in 2010. The industrial field trip was organized in the early weeks of the engineering education course. Participating in an industrial field trip is a formal requirement of an engineering education program. After each course, the experience in organizing field trips is reflected and modified continuously to increase the effectiveness in the introduction to engineering for students. A process of organizing the industrial field trips has been developed to increase the effectiveness of education, which includes three main stages: (1) classroom activities to prepare for the field trip, (2) implementation of the field trip, and (3) reflections on the field trip experience. Results showed that the industrial field trips enhance the emotions of students about an engineering education field. This paper is a descriptive research, in which a case study is used to describe the experience of implementing the industrial field trips at Hung Yen University of Technology and Education.

DE LC harmonic oscillators; Barkhausen criterion; dynamical system theory;
   oscillation conditions
AB There are different types of electronic oscillators that have a wide variety of applications in areas such as computing, audio, communication, among others. One of these is the harmonic oscillators that generate an output sinusoidal signal. Due to the advantages of these, this paper proposes a methodology based on an analysis based on the dynamical system theory. This provides undergraduates a useful tool for a better understanding of the harmonic oscillators in order to design and implement accurately this kind of circuits. This tool complements the widely recognized Barkhausen criterion, which is a mathematical condition that must be satisfied by linear feedback oscillators. The analysis based on the dynamical system theory consists of obtaining a state matrix and its eigenvalues from the mathematical model of the oscillator circuits. The eigenvalues are adjusted to get an oscillator system, thus from this way, a set of conditions are derived. These conditions are complementary to those obtained by the Barkhausen criterion.

ID AWARENESS
AB Problem-based learning identifies problems in ways that are conducive to student learning and emphasizes problem-solving, critical thinking and collaborative skills. These three aspects are core to disassembly-assembly techniques used in higher education where students are required to engage with visual, auditory and kinesthetic learning within a laboratory environment. The purpose of this article is to describe a disassembly-assembly technique used in a compulsory engineering module and identify how many African engineering students can successfully create a problem (disassemble a two-stroke motor) and then correctly solve the problem (assemble the two-stroke motor back to a working condition). A longitudinal study involving quantitative data is used with descriptive statistics. Results indicate, that on average, 85.5% of African engineering students can successfully engage with the disassembly-assembly technique. A possible recommendation is to encourage more academics to make use of the disassembly-assembly technique with regard to engineering systems, equipment or machinery.

DE Networked control systems; web-based education; remote laboratory;

ID DELAY SYSTEMS; STABILITY
AB Networked control systems have recently experienced a surge in fundamental theoretical results ignited by numerous advantages of introducing shared multipurpose communication networks in control systems. Regarding developments on the practical side, however, a networked control system is still wanting when it comes to experimental platforms suitable for research and educational purposes, which contributes to most of networked control system theory being validated by means of numerical examples and simulations. This paper addresses this issue by presenting a low-cost real-time networked control system platform, based on custom hardware and software solutions that can be readily explored with the sole use of a web browser connected to the Internet. The technical decisions made during development represent a fundamentally novel take on networked control system experimental platforms that can potentially be reproduced by several universities. The platform provides the user with multiple controller and input reference options, network configurations, delay statistics, and even a downloadable file containing advanced experiment data. A survey conducted with students located over 1200 km away from the platform who used it during laboratory assignments highlight the system's usability and interactivity, and supports the platform is suitable for educational purposes.

AB A final year project is an effective tool in teaching complex engineering phenomena. Problem identification and formulation, applying mathematical and engineering knowledge for solving a problem, and design and synthesis of the final product are some of the outcomes that the students achieve upon completing such projects. In this paper, the design of an electrodynamic suspension system, in which an aluminium disc suspended above two concentric coils, is considered. The mathematical description is presented and proved that the value of electromagnetic force exerted on the disc is proportional to the inverse square of its height. The system is then simulated with a finite element method software and the effects of varying different system's parameters on the exerted force are studied through simulation results. Analytical calculations and simulation results are validated by being compared with experimental measurements, which show a close agreement.

AB This paper presents a methodology for teaching analog design concepts in the context of a single conceptual design and competition. The autonomous audio heater car is a comprehensive project-based analog design experience within a conceive, design, implement, operate framework. The students participate in the overall design process with guided discovery, rather than merely conducting scripted laboratory exercises. Students develop an understanding of the analog design required for each subsystem through weekly individual pre-laboratory and laboratory exercises. The car is guided to a beacon by light and/or audio tone. In transit, the car heats water to a temperature corresponding to the beacon tone and emits a tone corresponding to the instantaneous water temperature. The project culminates with team-based system integration and a competition. The individual work serves to cross-train all of the team members such that they all contribute effectively in the teams. The project motivated students because it provided a framework for laboratory topics, which would typically be considered without the broader context of a system design introduced at the beginning of the course.

ID STANDARD
AB This paper focuses on achieving traceability of high voltage measurements up to 200 kV at the Egyptian National Institute of Standards. The measurement system consists of an AC/DC voltmeter and a universal resistive/capacitive high voltage divider. The voltmeter shows measured voltage values based on the scale factor of the voltage divider. The divider ensures a stable capacitance for AC voltage measurements and an additional resistive parallel path for DC voltage measurements. Both the divider and the voltmeter are calibrated in AC and DC modes. All uncertainty components are taken into account to obtain measured values with an acceptable accuracy. The calibration results in traceability to the national standards, which make measurements using the international system of units. The proposed calibration method is useful for the theory and practice of high voltage measurements in education, industrial applications, and electrical metrology studies.

AB Study of Engineering Control is often perceived by students as highly complex and a difficult hurdle to pass. The authors of this paper were prompted to propose changes to the teaching of a final year control unit of a BEng (Hons) Degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering after numerous students had expressed concern about their ability to be successful in this subject. The average exam grade had also been low for several years. Teaching previously had been didactic in nature, based on lectures, predefined laboratory exercises and tutorial sessions. Use of appropriate-based workshop study sessions can lead to higher levels of attainment and development, and student perception is that the experience is informal, engaging but appropriately challenging. A series of workshop sessions were introduced into term two of the unit teaching over a period of several weeks. Students worked individually on learning improvement activities, within cooperative groups in an informal workshop environment. The tasks set to the students were challenging and designed to improve general skills in Control, and students were encouraged to explore further areas that interested them. Results presented in this paper describe an improvement in student engagement, confidence in exam preparation and communication of learning measured by grades since the introduction of the workshop sessions, and improved feedback from students. The workshop sessions were integrated into the teaching scheme rather than being elective and did not require any additional timetable sessions.

AB Electrical engineering education textbooks usually restrict the linking between theory and practical work in power quality problems, such as voltage sag/swell. This paper presents a mathematic model of the power signal and digital signal processing tools, such as Kalman filter and wavelet transform, for analysis and detection of voltage sag/swell. Aiming at education and teaching in electrical power quality courses, M files for Kalman filter and wavelet transform in the Matlab program are introduced to record and track the waveform distortion with harmonics, voltage sag or a pulse, which allow students to simulate the effect of voltage sag and to see immediately the advantages and limitations of these two techniques for power quality problems.

AB The Eco-Energy Engineering course for students of Mechanical Engineering at Master level at AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow is predominantly theoretical, with the additional computer-aided projects. In order to improve the quality of the course and make the learning process easier for students, some practical elements were introduced. One of them is the presented laboratory stand for the measurement and analysis of photovoltaic modules. The proposed platform consists of a photovoltaic module, rechargeable battery, variable load, charge controller, digital thermometer, solar radiation sensor, and measuring circuit. All the measured variables are stored on the SD card. Also, PC can be connected via the USB port. In order to make the teaching more dynamical, this stand was designed as mobile and it does not need an external power supply. A prototype of the stand was built and tested in real conditions during laboratory classes. A positive feedback from students showed the correctness of the proposed learning schedule and the didactic potential of the laboratory stand.

AB The technological world has witnessed many revolutions since the beginning of the 21st century, such as mobile development, cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence and also the Internet of Things. The internet of things revolution is driven by a broader access to internet and versatility of programmable hardware devices that can communicate between each other. In order to make internet of things devices, a technical background is required in many fields, especially electronics and Computer Science. Therefore, many efforts are put in place to develop educational kits that simplify the basics of these two fields so that everyone can make his internet of things prototype without technical knowledge. The authors present their own initiative: IOIOAI that simplifies the programming process for the input output input output electrical board. The service has been tested successfully on children and young students. In this paper, the authors present a wider adoption for their initiative. The IOIOAI service is implemented in introductory course to embedded systems for electrical and computer science students during the 2016-2017 academic year in the National Engineering School of Sfax, Tunisia. The efficiency of the solution is analyzed based on the students' marks and feedback.

AB The interest in optimization problems involving distributed generation units has grown among undergraduate and graduate students since distributed generation unit connections have been encouraged around the world, requiring efficient power system analysis tools to solve them. The available open access tools are commonly focused on transmission network analysis. On the other hand, commercial tools adapted to radial networks do not allow the students to follow the intermediary calculations and learn with them. In many cases, the students have to develop their own computational tools, which is a time-consuming activity. This paper aims to fill the gap encountered by undergraduate and graduate students when they are performing their optimization problems involving distributed generation units, presenting the advantages of a new power flow tool focused on radial electrical distribution networks with high levels of unbalanced loads which require a three-phase power flow tool to be analyzed. The use of the proposed tool allows the students focus on their research, reducing the time spent on programming, and learning about power flow analysis applied to radial networks.

AB An advanced teaching method for the analysis of balanced operations of overhead transmission lines has been described in this paper. The proposed educational method combines theoretical, simulation and experimental approaches with the purpose of a higher-level knowledge achievement. Several exercises have been defined and implemented in the teaching process. Some characteristic overhead transmission line steady state regimes, such as Ferranti effect, natural load flow and capacitive overhead transmission line behaviour, have been analysed. The special analysis has been carried out in order to determine the basic characteristics of the switching transients. Software package MATLAB/Simulink has been used for the estimation of system parameters and for the simulation analysis. Different overhead transmission line models have been compared and useful modelling guidelines have been recommended. Experimental calculations have been performed by using a physically scaled system consisting of multiple Pi sections representing 100 km length 400 kV overhead transmission line. The proposed method has been tested within High Voltage Engineering undergraduate course and useful application feedback from students has been obtained.

AB This article provides a didactic platform that is developed to improve the teaching as well as learning of "design of compensators" in control systems engineering. The educational tool comprises a graphical user interface in MATLAB. The graphical user interface permits an individual to investigate various parameters involved in the design of the required compensator, which includes percentage overshoot, peak time, and velocity error constant and observe the results dynamically as the parameters change. The approach used in this article for the design of compensators is based on the frequency response analysis. One can obtain various plots including unit step response plot, Bode plot, and root locus plot for uncompensated and compensated systems to have a better understanding of the designed compensator.
