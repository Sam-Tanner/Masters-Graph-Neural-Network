#Data Setup Code:

-Has original datasets (".xls" and ".txt") and created datasets (".csv" and "_t.txt")

-Code is in .py format and has a required run order to function if only raw data present

-Run Order: Reformat.py -> text_to_CSV.py -> CSV_Cleaner.py -> csv_to_text.py -> XXXXX_Cent2.py (these final files require the addition of fraud labels ['FR'] which is done manualy)
