This study used a special study on Korean children (PSKC) 2-4 waves. Use t-test, correlation and autoregressive cross-delay modeling to analyze the data. The main findings of this study are: First, over time, parental pressure and mother's social research report are consistent. Secondly, the pressure of motherhood and childcare has an obvious lagging effect on upbringing, and vice versa. Third, there is no significant difference between working mothers and non-working mothers in terms of the stability of working parents' pressure, social research report and social research report for children's pressure channels. However, parental pressure can only predict the social research report of working mothers. Fourth, there is no significant difference between the stability and interaction of these two structures in household income levels. In short, the results show that, over time, parental pressure is consistent with mother's social research report. The results also show that there is a significant cross-lag effect between the mothers' perceptions of mutual pressure analysis. In the process from parental pressure to social research report, I found the difference between working and non-working mothers. The advantage of this study is that the expected longitudinal design was adopted during infancy and the priority between the two structures can be considered. The results of this study can be used as a source of intervention plans to help parents withstand severe parenting pressure and lack of social research report.","[Wang, Yong] Sejong Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 05006, South Korea","Wang, Y (corresponding author), Sejong Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 05006, South Korea.",1036373640@qq.com,,", Yong Wang/0000-0002-2737-362X",,,,19,0,0,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Graduates go to the society, what they learn is not what they use. There is a phenomenon that education and employment deviate from each other. Even if they have a job, they have to learn again, which requires a longer adaptation period. According to the skills and abilities that human resource management (HRM) students may enter into after graduation, a targeted modular teaching system is constructed. The modular teaching system can carry out customized learning in advance according to the students' work goals, and grasp the required employability in advance. At the same time, the reform of the system also enriches the teaching methods of teachers. Through the questionnaire and experimental test, this paper finds that: modular teaching breaks the traditional curriculum design method under the framework of the discipline theoretical system, aims to cultivate students' professional ability, improve their adaptability to the job, and further enhance their practical employability. Experimental results: the relationship between the quality characteristics and academic performance of HRM students was verified, and the relationship between them and the influence model of causality were clarified. The results of the two classes are similar in the pre-test; and from the back results, we can see that the scores of the experimental class after the use of modular teaching are significantly improved, while the comparison class is not significantly improved compared with before the experiment, which fully shows that the implementation of modular teaching can help students improve their comprehensive performance. The path coefficient of growth driven to academic performance is 0.428, the path coefficient of learning development to academic performance is 0.122, and interpersonal skills affect academic performance indirectly. It fully verifies the relationship between the quality characteristic model and academic performance, and shows that the quality characteristic model constructed is relatively perfect and can be used as a reference for students' evaluation.","[Li, Chunyang] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Educ, D-01187 Dresden, Saxony, Germany","Li, CY (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Educ, D-01187 Dresden, Saxony, Germany.",lichunyang5181@163.com,,,,,,25,0,0,2,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

And through the research on the main problems existing in the current moral education curriculum teaching, it is found that the teaching methods are backward, the curriculum is few, and the teaching materials are unrealistic. This has led to the unsatisfactory effect of the moral education curriculum. This paper analyzes the causes of these problems, and uses the method of questionnaire survey to investigate the current situation of moral education teaching in a university in our city. The survey results show that most teachers and students think that moral education course is of great significance, but they are not interested in it.

A SPD course requires teamwork of students. It is therefore an important issue about how to group students in a more reasonable form to increase students' interest in the course and improve their performance. However, at present, it remains a challenge to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of group teaching and optimize group teaching through state-of-the-art methods such as artificial intelligence. In this study, we propose a qualitative analysis method to study the group teaching of students through teacher's subjective evaluation of different aspects of students' abilities. In particular, the proposed method is a background-based grouping method which takes into account the students' scores attained in prerequisite courses of a SPD course and realized by a genetic algorithm. Results of our experiment demonstrate that, compared with the conventional random grouping method, the proposed method improves the students' average scores in all eight SPD topics by 2.5 in the grade 2016 and 1.875 in grade 2017, respectively (the total score is 100). Therefore, our findings strongly support that grouping students based on their strengths (for example, the courses they are good at) can enhance students' interest in the SPD course and thereby improve students' SPD performance.","[Liu, Jun; Peng, Yuanxiu; Yang, Yihua] Nanchang Hangkong Univ, Dept Automat, Coll Informat Engn, Nanchang 330063, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","Liu, J (corresponding author), Nanchang Hangkong Univ, Dept Automat, Coll Informat Engn, Nanchang 330063, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",tosskid@126.com,,, [JXJG18-8-18],This research was supported by the 2018 teaching reform project of Jiangxi Province (JXJG18-8-18).,,20,0,0,1,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

It has hitherto been part of the curriculum, right from kindergarten, to the higher institutions of learning like colleges and universities. It is thus imperative to form a concrete system that will ensure its smooth operation. The School sports management system is efficient with this respect. The School Sports management system (SSMS) is a set of protocols, procedures, and techniques used in educational institutions to ensure that all the activities run conclusively and smoothly. In sports and sporting activities, numerous reforms are always put in place and implemented to establish and improve the operational processes. An existing SSMS should accommodate these reforms and incorporate them into school sports and physical education curricula, which is the objective of this paper. This paper aims at discussing how the SSMS can adapt to sports reforms and If the school wants to reform the function of physical education, it needs to innovate the sports management system. At present, there are many drawbacks in school physical education. The following problems hinder the development of school physical education to a great extent. First, the related funds of school physical education subjects are obviously insufficient, the related expenses of physical education subjects account for a small proportion of the total funds of the school. Compared with the growth of the total funds of the school, the proportion is small, the equipment is not updated in a timely manner, and the development of physical education subjects mainly depends on the school allocation, which makes it difficult to form a benign fundraising mechanism. Second, the allocation of resources in the use of school physical education funds is not reasonable, and the allocation among teaching, scientific research and training expenses of sports teams is not appropriate. Third, the physical education departments of colleges and universities lack rational and scientific management, and lack of vitality within the departments, which to a large extent hinders the effective play of physical education functions. Therefore, in view of the above problems, this paper puts forward several principles that should be followed in the development of sports management system in the future.accustom to the changes. We discuss the importance of a management system in school sports explicitly, expounding on its operation. We then provide a listing of the reforms sports have encountered in recent times and how they can be integrated into the school curriculum.","[Zhang, Jiaxin; Fang, Wei] Yongin Univ, Sch Dept Phys Educ, Yongin, South Korea","Fang, W (corresponding author), Yongin Univ, Sch Dept Phys Educ, Yongin, South Korea.",fangwei931124@163.com,,,,,,13,0,0,5,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In this paper, we analyze the effect of China's official export credit insurance on Chinese exports to countries in the world. We describes the background of official export insurance in general and the development of China's ECI. Meanwhile, we discuss the data and model used to examine the relationship between China's ECIs and exports. We estimate both the static and dynamic gravity models where exports are a function of country size, transportation costs, and country-risk. Our results of static model suggest that that a 1 percent increase in China's official ECI coverage stimulates its exports volume by 0.34 percent. Furthermore, Chinese companies export 1.5 times more to countries with ECIs than to those countries where ECIs are not available. Our estimates from the dynamic model are similar to the static model, to a lesser extent, of ECI impacts on exports to trading partners.","[Fang, Fengxia] Meizhouwan Vocat Technol Coll, Dept Business Adm, Putian 351119, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Chou, Nan-Ting] Univ Louisville, Dept Econ, Louisville, KY USA","Fang, FX (corresponding author), Meizhouwan Vocat Technol Coll, Dept Business Adm, Putian 351119, Fujian, Peoples R China.",ffx2036@outlook.com,,,,,,17,0,0,5,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This study aims to examine if childhood trauma and internet addiction does predict depression on LBA in comparison to Non-Left Behind Adolescents (NLBA) in China. Methods Participants in the study includes a sample of 1890 adolescents aged 12 to 27, including 102 LBA and 1399 NLBA in China. All participants completed the self-report questionnaires, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-28), Internet Addiction Test (IAT), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results There was a significant difference in IAT and CTQ between LBA and NLBA (P < 0.05). The frequent childhood trauma type was physical neglect (48%), followed by emotional neglect (32.3%). Males reported higher levels of emotional and physical abuse and physical neglect than female counterparts in LBA. The prevalence of depression (23.5%) and internet addiction (29.4%) were higher among LBA than NLBA. There were no significant differences in depression (p > 0.05). There were positive correlations between CTQ (except emotional neglect), BDI, and IAT. Multiple linear regressions indicated that emotional abuse and neglect, internet addiction, and poor academic performance were significant predictors for depression among LBA. Conclusion Childhood trauma and internet addiction were directly related to symptoms of depression in LBA, There is an urgent need for targeted interventions for LBA to prevent negative mental health outcomes.","[Dong, Xue; Du, JiaYu; Hu, Yahua; Wang, ZhengHong] Shaanxi Univ Sci & Technol, Youth Mental Hlth Educ & Counseling Ctr, Dept Psychol, Xian 710021, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Su, Fang] Shaanxi Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ & Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Dong, X (corresponding author), Shaanxi Univ Sci & Technol, Youth Mental Hlth Educ & Counseling Ctr, Dept Psychol, Xian 710021, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",dongxue@sust.edu.cn,,,Shaanxi Social Science Fund Project of China: Exploration of the Intervention Mechanism of Psychological trauma for Left-behind University Students in Shaanxi Province [2017P006]; student academic development studio of Shannxi Province,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the Shaanxi Social Science Fund Project of China: Exploration of the Intervention Mechanism of Psychological trauma for Left-behind University Students in Shaanxi Province (NO.2017P006).

The boosted reference is the addition of sine reference with injection of 1/3rd of reference amplitude (3fs) in the middle portion of the reference wave. i.e., Pi/3 to 2 Pi/3 and 4 Pi/3 to 5 Pi/3. The proposed PWM scheme use two carriers, one is Triangle wave and another one is inverted Triangle wave. The process of selecting the winning carrier among the two triangle carriers is purely based on the LFSR technique. The spectral quality of the induction motor drives has improved by the random carriers. The simulation and experimental values are proving the validity of the PWM method.

The purpose is to find a new method that can be used in traditional handicraft design, and to explore the application of 3 D reconstruction technology in it. Based on the description and analysis of 3 D reconstruction technology, the 3 D reconstruction algorithm based on Poisson equation is analyzed, and the key steps and problems of the method are clarified. Then, by introducing the shielding design constraint, a 3 D reconstruction algorithm based on shielded Poisson equation is proposed. Finally, the performance of two algorithms is compared by reconstructing the 3 D image of rabbit. The results show that: when the depth value of the algorithm is 11, the surface of the rabbit image obtained by the proposed optimization algorithm is smoother, and the details are more delicate and fluent; under different depth values, with the increase of the depth value, the number of vertices and faces of the two algorithms increase, and the optimal depth values of 3 D reconstruction are more than 8. However, the proposed optimization algorithm has more vertices, and performs better in the reconstruction process; the larger the depth value is, the more time and memory are consumed in 3 D reconstruction, so it is necessary to select the appropriate depth value; the shielding parameters of the algorithm have a great impact on the fineness of the reconstruction model. The larger the parameter is, the higher the fineness is. In a word, the proposed 3 D reconstruction algorithm based on shielded Poisson equation has better practicability and superiority.","[Zhang, GuoLong] Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Sch Art & Design, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China","Zhang, GL (corresponding author), Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Sch Art & Design, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.",animo@mail.lzjtu.cn,,,National Social Science Foundation Art Project Research on the Inheritance and Innovation of Shadow Play from the Perspective of Virtual Interactive Technology [17BB033],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: National Social Science Foundation Art Project Research on the Inheritance and Innovation of Shadow Play from the Perspective of Virtual Interactive Technology (Grant No. 17BB033).",,16,0,0,2,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In the context of multiculturalism, if we want to cultivate talents who can communicate across cultures, domestic English teaching needs further reforms. The unified implementation of English teaching in China has lasted for decades, and the research on teaching theory has gradually formed a stable framework. But from an overall point of view, instillation teaching under test-oriented education is not conducive to improving students' English practice level. In order to solve this problem, this article analyzes the cultural teaching content in college English teaching from a cross-cultural perspective, and emphasizes the importance of cultural infiltration in English teaching. At the same time, it analyzes the problems in teaching practice from multiple aspects of listening, speaking, reading, writing and translation, and puts forward suggestions for the construction of a cross-cultural communication ability training system. Experiments show that in the classes taught by ordinary English teachers, the average proportion of classroom culture teaching is only 14.995%; under the same conditions, the average proportion of classroom culture teaching in the classes taught by foreign teachers reaches 33.865%. Combined with the higher average scores of students in foreign teachers' classes, it can be known that cultural teaching can play a certain role in improving the level of comprehensive English teaching.","[Liu, Shuang] Jilin Sport Univ, Changchun 130000, Jilin, Peoples R China","Liu, S (corresponding author), Jilin Sport Univ, Changchun 130000, Jilin, Peoples R China.",41361899@qq.com,,,,,,25,1,1,9,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In recent years, Sang subculture has evolved from a form of network subculture that initially aroused the inner resonance and self-deprecation of middle school and college students, and has developed into a complete industrial chain formed under the combined effect of the deliberate catering of online media and the active marketing of businesses. Its existence eventually caused the mainstream ideology to be impacted, and the ideals, beliefs and value choices of some students were greatly affected. This article takes Sang language as an anchor, pays attention to the thought changes and behavior characteristics of middle school and college students, as well as the channels and methods of Sang language and subculture communication, and then deeply analyzes its motivation. This article finds that Sang language, due to its inherent unique form of mimicry, reflects the emotional and rational characteristics of youth groups in the process of socialization. In the end, it shows that the timely transformation of mainstream cultural discourse on the Internet, guiding the youth student groups to cultivate and practice positive values, and accurately locating life development goals, should become an important task for school youth cultivation.","[Dong, Dandan] Nanjing Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Dong, DD (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",dongdandan_me@163.com,"Dong, Dandan/AAQ-9200-2021","Dong, Dandan/0000-0002-7764-917X",,,,16,0,0,8,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

From the point of view of the characteristics of design as a subject, the discipline of design is comprehensive and application-oriented. It is comprehensive as it involves different types of disciplines such as technical skills, abstract concepts and theoretical knowledge, and different types of knowledge such as knowledge about practical skills, human thinking and information, as well as different types of capabilities such as professional skills, creative thinking, knowledge acquisition and application. The knowledge structure of the design subject consists of three dimensions, the thinking level, knowledge level and technical level. The inherent connections of the different branches of the design discipline are as follows: they are interconnected on the thinking level, related on the knowledge level and different on the skill level. The knowledge and abilities on these three dimensions compose the design skills designers should acquire, among which the thinking level serves as the foundational and core piece. Therefore, the design education reform should focus on cultivating students' abilities, especially students' thinking skills. Then, it can be concluded that design education should not emphasize the difference of design direction, but should pay attention to the training of students' design ability instead of the training of students' skills, especially the training of students' thinking ability.","[Gao Chao] Jingdezhen Ceram Inst, Grad Sch, Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Jin Yinzhen] Jingdezhen Ceram Inst, Sch Arts & Archaeol, Jingdezhen 333000, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","Jin, YZ (corresponding author), Jingdezhen Ceram Inst, Sch Arts & Archaeol, Jingdezhen 333000, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",327016271@qq.com,,,,,,31,0,0,12,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The four-coil configuration has the advantage of open space and good uniformity.

The Braunbeck configuration avoids rounding errors, but the structure is solidified and cannot meet the requirements of flexible sensors. In this study, we derive a general constraint equation that fits various four-coil configurations and show that the constraint parameter uniquely defines the configuration. Moreover, we develop a simple optimization approach that allows building the optimized configuration that lacks rounding errors of coil turns. We analyzed system performance for different coil cross sections and configurations. The comparison of the original Lee-Whiting and optimized coils revealed that the normalized maximum radius R-max increased by 7.67%. Finally, the increase in cross-section resulted in performance that was principally different from classical models. The proposed approach makes both scientific and educational contributions for future studies.","[Hu, Liangliang; Xu, Jinzhang] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Instrument Sci & Optoelect Engn, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jinzhang; Zhang, Xun; Hu, Zongyuan] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Qu, Zheng] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Nucl Sci & Technol, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China","Xu, JZ (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.;Xu, JZ (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.",xujz@hfut.edu.cn,,"Hu, Liangliang/0000-0002-1803-6269","National Natural Science Foundation of China [81527802, 12075072]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 81527802 and No. 12075072.",,22,0,0,2,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This paper uses ADAMS dynamic analysis software to carry out CFD simulation test on ball exercise equipment, and explore the influence of different parameters on the air movement of ball equipment. The results are as follows: (1) the factors that affect the track of rhythmic gymnastics ball in the air are the mass, volume, velocity of the ball, as well as the forces of the ball in the air. (2) The rotation speed of the ball is an important factor affecting the lateral bending degree of the track of rhythmic gymnastics ball. The rotation speed and the air pressure difference between the left and right sides of the ball are directly proportional to the curvature of the running track.(3) The gliding performance of rhythmic gymnastics ball mainly depends on the value of lift drag ratio, which has an important influence on the flight height and flight time of the ball, and its size changes with the attack angle. And there are some suggestions: rhythmic gymnastics ball in the air belongs to non dynamic flight. It is suggested that in practice, the athlete should consider a series of factors, such as the initial velocity of the ball, the throwing angle and the height of the shooting point, so as to effectively control the flight radian, distance and height of the artistic gymnastics ball.","[Ren Qihong] Xinjiang Normal Univ, Inst Phys Educ, Urumqi, Peoples R China","Ren, QH (corresponding author), Xinjiang Normal Univ, Inst Phys Educ, Urumqi, Peoples R China.",58505203@qq.com,,,Xinjiang Social Science Fund Project Research on the integration of cultural courtyard and mass sports from the perspective of Fanghuiju [19BTY097],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Project Name: Xinjiang Social Science Fund Project Research on the integration of cultural courtyard and mass sports from the perspective of Fanghuiju; project number: 19BTY097.",,8,0,0,1,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The research on the evaluation of English teaching quality is of crucial practical significance and theoretical value. Hence, student evaluation form for the college English classroom teaching quality that has been evaluated and has good reliability is used in this paper to expound the principles of the triangular fuzzy number evaluation method and the range method based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Examples are used to analyze the differences between the two methods as well as their advantages and disadvantages. The comprehensive evaluation result of the teaching quality evaluation of a teacher by using the range method is excellent (85.500 points), and the comprehensive evaluation result by using the triangular fuzzy number method based on the analytic hierarchy process is good (64.818 points). The results show that the range method is better for the comprehensive evaluation of teachers' teaching quality. The statistical analysis results suggest that there are differences between the two methods in the evaluation of the classroom teaching quality in colleges and universities (t = 11.197, P < 0.0001). In the evaluation of the teaching quality by using the triangular fuzzy number evaluation method based on the analytic hierarchy process, the non-linear and fuzzy features of evaluation factors are taken into consideration comprehensively. The weight values of various evaluation indexes are calculated scientifically. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations are combined to obtain the evaluation result of the classroom teaching quality of teachers more objectively, which is of great significance in the practical teaching quality evaluation process.","[Xie, Zhixian] Changchun Univ, Foreign Language Dept, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Su, Zheqian] Changchun Univ Chinese Med, Foreign Language Dept, Changchun 130117, Jilin, Peoples R China","Su, ZQ (corresponding author), Changchun Univ Chinese Med, Foreign Language Dept, Changchun 130117, Jilin, Peoples R China.",suzheqian@sohu.com,,,Apricot Woods Scholar Project 2019 -Young Scientist Project in Changchun University of Chinese Medicine; Jilin Province Vocational Education and Adult Education Teaching Reform Research Project:Study on The Multi-modal Chained Learning Model of Traditional Chinese Medicine English based on Mobile Internet Environment [2020ZCY345],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Apricot Woods Scholar Project 2019 -Young Scientist Project in Changchun University of Chinese Medicine; Jilin Province Vocational Education and Adult Education Teaching Reform Research Project:Study on The Multi-modal Chained Learning Model of Traditional Chinese Medicine English based on Mobile Internet Environment (NO.2020ZCY345).",,15,4,4,4,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Being able to predict future stock price in a relatively accurate way forms a significant task of stock market analysis. Different mechanisms from fundamental analysis to statistical modeling have been deployed to study stock market performance and various factors from fundamental factors, technical factors to market sentiments are also incorporated in the stock price prediction task. However, due to the chaotic stock market performance, which is close to random walk, and the difficulty in discerning influential factors, predicting stock price faces a lot of challenges. In recent years, fast development in fields such as machine learning has offered new ways to look at this task. In this paper, we employ Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm, a recent modification of traditional feedforward neural network with single hidden layer, whose learning speed is greatly improved based on solid mathematical background and capability to circumvent problems such as local minimum is also enhanced, to construct an ELM combination model to study stock market performance and predict stock price. A comparison between the predicted output and the real data is carried out to test the feasibility of applying ELM model to stock market analysis. The result indicates that ELM model is desirable for predicting stock price variation trend while some inaccuracy exists in the prediction of peak values, which may require further model modification. Overall, by applying the machine learning model ELM to predict stock price and generating desirable outcome, this paper both contributes to offering a new way to investigate stock market performance and enlarging the field deployment of ELM model as well.","[Zhang, Fangzhao] Univ British Columbia, Math & CS Dept, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Zhang, FZ (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Math & CS Dept, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",fangzhao.zh@gmail.com,,,,,,19,0,0,12,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

When attempting to take an exit, a driver's line of sight may be obscured by the curvature or slope of the main expressway, roadside vegetation, traffic signs, and other vehicles traveling alongside. These increase the likelihood of accidents due to inaccurate or poor driver judgement when approaching a highway exit. Because of emotional responses that accompany the possibility of missing an exit, many drivers act irrationally through haphazard acceleration or braking, aggressive lane changes; in some cases, even coming to a complete stop and reversing against the flow of high speed traffic to correct their course. This study applies to curved highway exit corridors with a poor line of sight. The total visible area of the exit ramp is defined in accordance with the design specifications of both the highway routes and exit ramps, which was then further refined by considering the driving characteristics of both the drivers and of surrounding traffic. This study set out to establish a reliable occlusion model of highway exits with the following goals in mind. Geometric equations describing the area and volume of the target area of the exit ramp are established. Discrete expression equation was deployed to establish the occlusion model for the target area within the visual field. Parameters taken from specifications of the Hunan section of the Shanghai-Kunming Expressway are used for multiple calculations, in which obstruction patterns of objects with the same width, and objects with different width at different positions are analyzed. Based on the patterns observed from stimulated experiments mentioned above, multiple effective measures were proposed to prevent the obstruction of the highway exit ramp. In summary, this study provides theoretical support for prevention of obstruction as well as an anti-occlusion model for better identification of the highway exit ramps by intelligent vehicle systems.","[Xiao, Jian; Huang, Zhongxiang] Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Traff & Transportat Engn, Changsha 410114, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Jian] Guangxi Univ, Sch Resource Environm & Mat, Nanning, Peoples R China; [Li, Yu; Yang, Liulin] Guangxi Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Nanning, Peoples R China; [He, Juanxia; Yang, Jian] Guangxi Polytech Construct, Nanning, Peoples R China","Huang, ZX (corresponding author), Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Traff & Transportat Engn, Changsha 410114, Hunan, Peoples R China.",447442396@qq.com,,,,,,19,0,0,3,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

It is shown by the comparison between the calculated results and the WICS wind tunnel tests when the Mach number is 2, the sound pressure level of every monitoring point is in good agreement with experiments. It indicates that the NLAS method which is based on turbulence reconstruction could well simulate the cavity noise in supersonic and reduce mesh numbers. Based on this, the contribution to aerodynamic noise suppression made by active control measure such as adding jet screen at the leading edge of cavity is investigated. It is found that jet screen improves flow condition and increases cavity safety, therefore, it is suitable for suppression of aerodynamic noise under supersonic condition.","[Chen, Binqi] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Aeronaut & Astronaut, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yiding] Sichuan Tengden Technol Co Ltd, Chengdu, Peoples R China","Wang, YD (corresponding author), Sichuan Tengden Technol Co Ltd, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",wyding127@163.com,,"Wang, Yiding/0000-0001-7393-980X",,,,22,1,1,5,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Creating a sports management system for basketball teams will thus have a great impact to the approximately 2.2 billion people using the online platforms. Since marketing is important in almost every field, we will be employing it in school sports. School sports assume a significant role in mental and physiological well-being, particularly in the information age. Its emergence has incredibly helped in the upkeep of a healthy well being and an exponential decrease in non-communicable diseases and chronic illnesses. As one of the sports being played in college institutions, Basketball is fundamental in maintaining an optimal body mass index (BMI) and reducing obesity. It should thus be encouraged. This study's objective is to oversee the creation of a sports marketing management system (SMMS) for college basketball teams. We explain the procedural processes involved in building the management system. This is because its mere presence and practice are not sufficient to oversee its full potential, marketing is at the core of every successful implementation and it is thus necessary to create this system for this sole purpose. Creating this system, especially in this data age is so important since there are a barrage of platforms to facilitate its use. A previous study has indicated a rise in the utilization of technological gadgets, such as PCs, cell phones, and work stations. Figure 1 indicates these findings. Making a management system that may be utilized with these gadgets will subsequently help access to numerous understudies. It will likewise assist in reaching a large circle of target audience. This is because participants will be not only able to participate on-site but also off-site. This investigation discretely explains the requirement for the SMMS.

Meanwhile, the application of lightweight network to pattern recognition has become a trend with the development of mobile networks. In order to improve the recognition accuracy of the lightweight network model MobileNetV2 and reduce the computational cost and delay caused by extracting rich features, an improved lightweight network model based on MobileNetV2 is proposed, in which an improved reverse residual module (C-Inverted residual block) is applied to replace the traditional module. In the improved reverse residual module, channel split operation is added to reduce MAC, and channel shuffle operations are used to promote information exchange and channel fusion. Experiments were carried out on Pascal VOC 2007 detection data set to test the general performance of the proposed improved model. Under the operation limits of 140 MFLOPS, 40 MFLOPS and 20 MFLOPS, mean average precision (mAP) of the improved MobileNetV2 algorithm increased by 1.2%, 2.2% and 4.3% compared with MobileNetV2. While the recognition accuracy of the proposed network model on self-made dataset of student classroom behavior states is 4.6% and 3.7% higher than that of MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2 respectively, and the average recognition rate of students' classroom behavior states can be up to 92.7%.

In SDN, different applications require the controller to deploy corresponding flow entries to maintain the effectiveness of network. However, the matching field range covered by entries of different applications may overlap, and when actions specified by these overlapping entries are inconsistent, conflicts may occur. Such conflicts may cause the flow to match the wrong entry, thereby affecting the correct expression of application functions. The scheme we proposed in this paper will be able to detect and resolve conflicts between flow entries. Firstly, we discussed the causes of conflicts, and then classified various conflict situations. This classification will help us to adopt different ways of resolving different types of conflicts and make the resolution of conflicts more targeted. Next, we propose a conflict detection algorithm based on B+ tree. This algorithm can detect different types of conflicts. According to theoretical proof, the use of B+ tree compared with other similar structures better in the performance of the time and space complexity. Finally, for the detected conflicting entries, we propose a conflict resolution scheme based on the failure degree of the flow entry according to the characteristics of SDN services tending to be more detailed.

Among these representative forces, film culture is mainly concentrated in the core of Chinese and English. On the radio, British film culture became English. The field of knowledge teaching is much larger. Based on the positive and positive English movies, this paper adopts the teaching method of Chinese and English double subtitle music to capture the words and sentences in the film, and uses the combination of image and sound to improve the perception of English. The difference between Chinese application and English application lies in the embodiment of traditional thinking mode in different countries. It is proved by experiments that there are great differences in application value. However, due to the iconicity and randomness of language symbols, the application of Chinese has some value in English. Students who adopt English film teaching method have advantages in shaping values and accepting foreign values.

Although there are many researches on LBC, there are few researches on LBC's physical and mental health(PMH).In this regard, this paper studies whether physical education and exercise are very important for improving PMH in LBC, and collects and classifies data on PMH in LBC by referring to the literature. Interviews are used to collect the true thoughts of LBC and to understand PMH. The questionnaire survey was used to investigate the PMH status of LBC, and objectively and comprehensively collected the PMH status data of LBC. Finally, the data obtained are statistically analyzed by the method of several examples. This paper studies the situation of LBC participating in extracurricular sports activities and makes a comparison with non-LBC. The results show that the LBC who take part in more after-school sports training have better PMH, more cheerful personality, more love and compassion, can quickly adapt to a new environment, and are emotionally stable. They can handle things calmly and develop their individual emotions well. In addition, the probability of PMH problems of non-LBC is smaller than that of LBC. Through the research and analysis of sports and PMH of LBC, it is found that sports play a positive role in promoting the PMH of LBC.

Its importance in physical and mental well-being cannot be overlooked, especially in this information age, where a sizeable subset of the population has adopted a sedentary lifestyle. Unwholesomeness is still evident notwithstanding its introduction and practice in most institutions. This is presumably due to the lack of a better way to utilize its full potential. This calls for better implementation, for which this paper is written. The object of this paper is to look into the application of sport skill transfer theory in teaching aerobics. Skill transfer is a method of propagating a skill from one docket to the other for the sole purpose of process improvement. Sport skill transfer is thus the process of adopting skills used in sports into the aerobics teaching curriculum. The transfer of these skills will transform the teaching curriculum and processes in the course of aerobics lessons. Some skills which the paper will be delving into are; the use of competition as a tool. Fair competition is always known to improve processes to a certain degree. Other than competition vs practice comparisons, the paper also looks into biofeedback for which it elaborates on the importance of employing electromyogram (EMG) in monitoring motor movements; bilateral skill transfer and the use of imagery are also elaborated. It further discusses the dynamics of aerobics and sports, drawing the similarities and differences of the duo and showing the application of the former's skills in teaching the later, especially in this information era.","[Yan, Song] Beijing Sport Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ao, Jinping] Cent China Normal Univ, Wuhan 430000, Peoples R China","Ao, JP (corresponding author), Cent China Normal Univ, Wuhan 430000, Peoples R China.",aomashiwan001@mail.ccnu.edu.cn,,,,,,21,1,1,1,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In this study, the ultrasonic-assisted organic acid removal of cadmium from mining soil was investigated using the following setup: 0.1 mol/L citric and oxalic acid, a 1:20 solid-liquid ratio, and 30 min of ultrasonic-assisted time. A cadmium removal rate of 69.10% was obtained when using organic acids, while it was only 61.82% for removal by oscillation extraction. This implies that the ultrasonic-assisted removal method has beneficial effects on the removal of cadmium via organic acid. Speciation analysis of cadmium in mining soils before and after organic acid removal was performed using the Tessier sequential extraction procedure. The results showed that exchangeable species and those bound to manganese, iron and carbonates were lower after ultrasonic-assisted organic acid removal. This indicates that organic acids can remove most of the removable cadmium from soil in mining areas fast and efficiently.","[Li, Xiao-Fen; Xiong, Hua-bin; Gao, Yun-tao] Yunnan Minzu Univ, Sch Chem & Environm, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Gao, YT (corresponding author), Yunnan Minzu Univ, Sch Chem & Environm, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",644465478@qq.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [201367025, 21665027]; Applied Basic Research Project of Yunnan Province Youth Program [2017FD118]; Scientific research fund project of Yunnan Education Department [2021J0656]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO. 201367025 and NO. 21665027) and by the Applied Basic Research Project of Yunnan Province Youth Program (NO. 2017FD118), and Scientific research fund project of Yunnan Education Department (NO. 2021J0656).",,24,0,0,2,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Currently majority of these firms follow a manual approach of hiring employees which is more prone to errors and time consuming. Prime purpose of the research is to develop an intelligent predictive model to decide upon candidate's suitability for an applied It based job. A sample size of 13,168 instances with 19 attributes of job seekers data are used for study. An ensemble predictive meta model approach is presented in the research where a stacked KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours) algorithm combined with hard voting approach is employed. The idea is to use a single unified predictive model in place of separate classification models by considering the predicted class with maximum votes against each class label. The proposed approach comprises two functional modules. 'Stacked KNN Learner Module' involves the use of five variants of KNN which include 1-NN, 3-NN, 5-NN, 7-NN and 9-NN. Individual prediction of the job seeker data from these variants of KNN algorithm are input to the 'Hard Voting Ensemble Predictive unit' which eventually aggregates majority of predicted class votes determined for each class label to generate the final output predicted class label on basis of maximum votes. The developed ensemble meta model is successfully implemented using python programming language and its performance evaluation is done using various metrics. The implemented model generated a 96.96% prediction accuracy rate. The specificity, sensitivity and f-score value recorded was 96.36%, 96.06% and 96.26% respectively. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root mean Square Error (RMSE) value observed with our proposed meta model was 0.0048 and 0.0102 respectively. A comparative analysis of the proposed model was done by varying the data sample size and it gave a consistent performance throughout. It was observed that proposed ensemble model gave an impressive 96.96% mean accuracy rate and the overall performance of other variants was consistent. Performance of proposed meta model was also compared with some existing techniques like C.45, CART and K-Means. It outperformed other techniques in terms of accurately predicting the class label of candidates applying for job. This ensemble meta model can be of great help for growing IT firms and assist the organization unit in hiring right and deserving candidates in future. Proposed work can act as a decision making framework in multi sector units with enormous work force to streamline performance appraisal process thereby enabling in hiring right people for right job.","[Mishra, Sushruta; Mallick, Pradeep K.; Tripathy, Hrudaya K.] Deemed Univ, Sch Comp Engn, Kalinga Inst Ind Technol, Bhubaneswar 751024, India; [Jena, Lambodar] SOA Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Bhubaneswar, India; [Chae, Gyoo-Soo] Baekseok Univ, Div Informat & Commun Engn, Cheonan, South Korea","Mishra, S (corresponding author), Deemed Univ, Sch Comp Engn, Kalinga Inst Ind Technol, Bhubaneswar 751024, India.",sushruta.mishrafcs@kiit.ac.in,"Tripathy, Hrudaya Kumar/AAD-2590-2019; Mallick, Pradeep/AAU-7923-2021; Jena, Lambodar/ABH-2564-2021",,,,,61,3,3,2,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Traditional methods usually use manual information to label or traverse rules only, resulting in limited representation capabilities and poor generalization performance of the model. In this paper, a kind of dynamic skeleton model with residual is adopted-a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network based on residual connections, which not only overcomes the limitations of previous methods, but also can learn the spatio-temporal model from the skeleton data. In the big bone NTU-RGB + D dataset, the network model not only improved the representation ability of human behavior characteristics, but also improved the generalization ability, and achieved better recognition effect than the existing model.

In particular, the situation can be more crucial for electrical power engineering education due to the importance of the direct relationship between the students and their instructor embodied in the campus' classroom interaction and the requisite face-to-face learning. Apparently, e-learning instructional design has provided a fairly accepted solution through online lectures and exams for power engineering courses. Nevertheless, the difficulty persists in moving the experiment equipment of the laboratories to the homes of the students since most experiments were likely to be carried out on the University campus' dedicated power system panels. An urgent and reduced cost solution is therefore needed. This paper introduces a shortcut design method as a compensatory solution at no extra cost, which during this challenging period is suitable for teaching power system labs and also suitable for full online education programs. The work presented in the paper goes beyond that to discuss the relevance to ABET student outcomes. Two experiments are presented in the PowerWorld Simulator environment with systematic steps to facilitate the expansion of the rest of the laboratory experiments. The method is based on the simulation of a textbook example and the verification of results from another textbook followed by a discussion of the relevant students' outcomes of ABET.

However, in the research of computer-aided language system, there are still some deficiencies in the recognition of English spoken stress nodes, which cannot be well recognized. Based on this, this paper proposes a method of English spoken accent recognition based on natural language processing and endpoint detection algorithm, which aims to promote the accuracy of accent recognition in the computer-aided language system and improve the performance of the computer-aided language system. In order to avoid the interference of background noise, this paper proposes a short-term time-frequency endpoint detection algorithm which can accurately judge the beginning and end of speech in complex environment. Then, on the basis of traditional speech feature extraction and fractal dimension theory, a nonlinear fractal dimension speech feature is extracted. Finally, RankNet is used to process the extracted features to realize the recognition of English spoken stress nodes. In the simulation analysis, the application effect of the short-term time-frequency endpoint detection algorithm proposed in this paper in the complex background noise and the effect of non-linear fractal dimension speech features on the recognition of English spoken stress nodes are verified.

In this research work a new algorithm is proposed for Face and Age Recognition (FAR) by using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine (RBF-SVM) classifier, and Rotational Local Binary Pattern (RLBP). RLBP is utilized for the selection and extraction of features from the face image. In this algorithm, extract the face component like Nose, Mouth, Left and Right eye. In the preprocessing stage median filter is used to remove noises from the face image. By using this, there is an improvement in the feature extraction procedure. In pattern recognition, a basic errand is finding a picture from the picture parts. For the implementation of results FG-NET ((Face and Gesture Recognition Network) and AT&T datasets are used. The detection rate of face recognition has reached up to 92-98% and the detection rate for age recognition is 87%. The proposed algorithm is compared with SVM shows better over previous algorithms and also estimate the value of accuracy.","[Beniwal, Sonal] Uttarakhand Syst Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Singh, Ajit] Bipin Tripathi Kumaon Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dwarahat, Almora, India; [Kant, Chander] Kurukshetra Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Applicat, Kurukshetra, Haryana, India","Beniwal, S (corresponding author), BPSMV, Dept CSE & IT, Sonipat 131305, Haryana, India.",sonalkharb@gmail.com,,,,,,17,2,2,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

However, there have been few studies on the probabilistic forecasts of LLWS obtained from ensemble prediction system. In this study, we analyzed a reliability analysis to verify LLWS ensemble member forecasts and observation based on the limited grid points around Jeju International Airport in Jeju. Homogeneous and non-homogeneous regression models were used to reduce the bias and dispersion existing ensemble prediction system and to provide probabilistic forecast. Prior to applying probabilistic forecast model, reliability analysis was conducted by using rank histogram to identify the statistical consistency of LLWS ensemble forecasts and corresponding observations. Based on the results of our study, we found that LLWS ensemble forecasts had a consistent positive bias, indicating over-forecasting, and were under-dispersed for all seasons. To correct such biases, homogeneous regression and non-homogeneous regressions as EMOS (Ensemble Model Output Statistics) and EMOS exchangeable model by assuming exchangeable ensemble members were applied. The prediction skills of the methods were compared by the mean absolute error and continuous ranked probability score. We found that the prediction skills of probabilistic forecasts of EMOS exchangeable model were superior to the bias-corrected forecasts in terms of deterministic prediction.","[Lee, Young-Gon] Korea Meteorol Adm, Radar Planning Team, Weather Radar Ctr, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Chansoo] Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Appl Math, Gongju 32588, South Korea","Kim, C (corresponding author), Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Appl Math, Gongju 32588, South Korea.",chanskim@kongju.ac.kr,,"Kim, Chansoo/0000-0002-7594-9072",Kongju National University,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is supported by the research grant of the Kongju National University in 2020.",,23,1,1,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

But the fierce competition, for athletes, is not only physical competition, psychological competition is particularly important. Psychological pressure is an important factor that affects athletes to play at a high level in the competition field. How to analyze the pressure source of athletes in the competition field is very important for athletes to overcome the competition pressure. Therefore, this paper designs a method based on the improved hierarchical K-Means clustering algorithm (KMCA) to analyze the pressure source of athletes in the competition field, so as to help athletes overcome the pressure on the competition field and promote their high-level performance. In this method, firstly, 182 athletes were investigated by questionnaire to obtain the data of related psychological pressure sources. Secondly, because KMCA is sensitive to the selection of initial class center, the performance of KMCA is directly related to the selection of initial class. Aiming at the problem of KMCA, this paper proposes an improved hierarchical KMCA. Finally, the improved hierarchical KMCA is applied to the clustering analysis of sports competition pressure source data. Through simulation analysis, compared with KMCA, the improved layered KMCA proposed in this paper has a good performance improvement. The improved hierarchical KMCA proposed in this paper can be applied to the analysis of the pressure source of athletes in the competition field, which can analyze the pressure of athletes and get the characteristics of the pressure of athletes, so as to help athletes overcome the pressure in the competition field and achieve the mental health of the competition field?","[Wu, Qian] Jilin Sport Univ Coll, Changchun 130000, Jilin, Peoples R China","Wu, Q (corresponding author), Jilin Sport Univ Coll, Changchun 130000, Jilin, Peoples R China.",wenjia-lny@163.com,,,,,,21,0,0,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Besides, a large number of studies have been made by scholars at home and abroad in this field. In this paper, the influence of middle school students' self-efficacy on online learning resource purchase intention is analyzed, and the study comprises two stages. To be specific, in the first stage, the interview method is adopted to acquire related materials, and the grounded theory is also followed to reconstruct the theoretical research framework; in the second stage, the theoretical framework is empirically verified by the questionnaire. Then, it is found that middle school students' self-efficacy affects the identity about online learning resources' perceived quality and their purchase intention for online learning resources. At the same time, the teacher-student relation may also reinforce students' purchase intention for online learning resources. Thus, it can be seen that online learning resources' perceived quality and the intimate teacher-student relation have significant influence on middle school students' purchase intention.","[Chen, Guomin; Jin, Yingwei; Liang, Wang; Liu, Yang] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; Jilin Business & Technol Coll, Changchun, Peoples R China","Chen, GM (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.",dr.chen@mail.dlut.edu.cn,"guomin, chen/AAD-6775-2021; Chen, Guomin/AAG-3282-2021","Chen, Guomin/0000-0002-1171-2711; Chen, Guomin/0000-0003-0753-9415",,,,37,4,4,9,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The novelty of this paper is the construction of the autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model, which lays the foundation for the prediction of financial market trends through the construction of the model. However, there are some shortcomings in this article. The overall overview of the financial market is not very clear, and the prediction of the BP network is not so comprehensive. Finally, through the actual data statistics of market transactions, the effectiveness of the GARCH-BP model was tested, analyzed and researched. The final results show that model has a good effect on the prediction and trend analysis of market, and its accuracy and availability greatly improved compared with the previous conventional approach, which is worth further study and extensive research It is believed that the financial market prediction model will become one of the mainstream tools in the industry after its later improvement.","[Yin, Xinzhe; Li, Jinghua] Sichuan Int Studies Univ, Sch Int Business, Chongqing, Peoples R China","Li, JH (corresponding author), Sichuan Int Studies Univ, Chongqing 400031, Peoples R China.",jinghuali@sisu.edu.cn,,,,,,20,0,0,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Combined with the theory of AVC, the theoretical basis for the expression of regional culture in the planning and construction of rural landscape is put forward. The results show that after the construction of the AVC evaluation system for the special terrain and deep cultural heritage of Dang village in Hancheng City, Shaanxi Province, the comprehensive AVC score of Dang village landscape is 0.3121, and the comprehensive scores of attraction, vitality, and capacity are 0.3055, 0.2985, and 0.3381, respectively. In summary, it is concluded that although Dang village has a good cultural environment and profound background, it lacks reasonable development and orderly planning measures, resulting in the gradual loss of its unique regional culture. Finally, combined with the AVC evaluation and analysis results, suggestions for the follow-up construction planning of Dang village are put forward and applied to practical teaching research. The results can provide a reference for studying the expression of regional culture in landscape planning and design.","[Wang, Xin] LanZhou JiaoTong Univ, Sch Art & Design, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China","Wang, X (corresponding author), LanZhou JiaoTong Univ, Sch Art & Design, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.",wangxin@mail.lzjtu.cn,,,,,,18,0,0,15,42,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Our lifestyle has undergone fundamental changes in almost every aspect: network-based computers are used in almost every aspect of social daily life. It has become a means of household information exchange; the number of web-based distance education learners exceeds traditional face-to-face teaching. Therefore, processing power is very important for clever computers to search, analyze, synthesize and exchange information online. In addition to reading and writing, this ability is seen as a new electronic literacy. Those who lack it will be considered illiterate in the near future. Since English has gained the status of a global language, about 85% of the world's electronically stored information is in English, how to inject English learners into electronic culture to ensure the survival of every citizen. The digital age has become the basic task of every educator, especially those who teach English. This paper uses questionnaires and interviews to investigate and analyze the adaptability of college students' English autonomous learning from three aspects: learning concept, learning environment and learning style. The survey results show that students are relatively uncomfortable with English autonomous learning in the multimedia network environment, especially for the online learning environment. On this basis, this paper proposes suggestions for improvement of the current teaching model, in order to help college students to carry out independent learning better.","[Xu, Shuyan] Shangluo Univ, Coll Humanities, Shangluo, Peoples R China; [Xu, Shuyan; Li, Xiang] Guangdong Police Coll, Dept Basic Courses, Guangzhou 510230, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xianhua] Shangluo Univ, Coll Hlth & Management, Shangluo, Peoples R China","Li, X (corresponding author), Guangdong Police Coll, Dept Basic Courses, Guangzhou 510230, Peoples R China.",20050398@gdppla.edu.cn,,,,,,17,0,0,6,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The circadian rhythm is a phenomenon in which the flow of physical activity is repeated every 24 hours and is synchronized mainly by natural light. However, since people's exposure time to artificial lighting has increased recently, the issue of circadian rhythm imbalance has been raised, and lighting techniques for reproducing the color temperature or wavelength characteristics of natural light have been proposed. There has not been any case for the short-wavelength ratio cycle reproduction of natural light close to the circadian rhythm; thus, a circadian rhythm-assisted LED light that reproduces the short-wavelength ratio of natural light for one day is presented in this paper, and its effect is confirmed through animal experiment. After the lighting control standard is derived through the analysis of natural light characteristics, its periodic short-wavelength ratio is realized through the control of each LED lighting channel. Subsequently, rat-based animal experiment is conducted to analyze the amount of melatonin, a major factor in circadian rhythm. The results confirm that the proposed lighting environment has higher melatonin levels by about 17% (day7) and 24% (day14) compared with the general lighting environment.","[Oh, Seung-Taek] Kongju Natl Univ, Smart Nat Space Res Ctr, Cheonan, South Korea; [Lim, Jae-Hyun] Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Cheonan 31080, Chungcheongnam, South Korea; [Lim, Jae-Hyun] Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Urban Syst Engn, Cheonan, South Korea","Lim, JH (corresponding author), Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Cheonan 31080, Chungcheongnam, South Korea.",defacto@kongju.ac.kr,,"Lim, Jae-Hyun/0000-0001-7169-8969; Oh, SeungTaek/0000-0003-1512-9897","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [2019R1A6A1A03032988, 2020R1I1A3073320]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2019R1A6A1A03032988; 2020R1I1A3073320).",,21,2,2,2,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Then, the effect of positive psychology in college teaching is analyzed. Through the research, the results show that when analyzing the positive state of students, most students in life are more active, but in the high school, there are fewer active students, most of them know some compulsory knowledge points to meet the final exams. Most of the students' positive state of learning needs to be improved, and the enthusiasm and initiative of learning are not enough to make any benefit to learning. When analyzing the positive state of teachers, it is found that teachers are more motivated in life. The enthusiasm in the classroom is general, and nearly 80% of the teachers believe that the enthusiasm of life is helpful to the enthusiasm of the classroom; when analyzing the implementation of the three-dimensional goal, it is found that although the teacher emphasizes the importance of the goal of emotional values, less than half of the actual implementation has been put in place. In the analysis of the necessity and feasibility of infiltrating positive psychology in college teaching, it is believed that the use of positive psychology guidance can reduce the burden on students and cultivate positive emotions, scientific values and attitudes towards life. The results show that through the investigation and analysis of the application of positive psychology in college teaching, although there are some shortcomings in the research process, it can still provide reference basis for the application of positive psychology in teaching, with a view to provide a guiding direction for the improvement of future teaching level of colleges and universities.","[Chen, Pei-lin] China Univ Lab Relat, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China","Chen, PL (corresponding author), China Univ Lab Relat, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.",articlecpl@126.com,,"Chen, Pei-lin/0000-0002-5845-6348",,,,18,2,2,9,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Based on a two-sector theoretical model, this paper explores the factors restraining the transformation from traditional to modern agriculture and their relationship with economic growth. Using a sample of 31 provinces and cities in mainland China from 1990 to 2016, the results show that the relative price of industrial and agricultural products has a direct impact on the willingness of people to adopt modern technology. Specifically, the relative price of industrial and agricultural products forms a single combined threshold for agricultural modernisation, while the relative productivity of industry and agriculture form a double threshold for per capita GDP, these also show a significant nonlinear relationship. Moreover, the agricultural modernisation of the provinces and cities in the mainland of China is not randomly distributed. There are hot spots with high-value aggregations. The relative productivity has a significant spillover effect on per capita income, and has a negative impact on per capita income in neighbouring areas. Agricultural modernisation can breakthrough economic stagnation and become the driving force for the economy to enter a new round of growth.","[Li, Qian; Zeng, Miao; Du, Jiang] Sichuan Univ, Sch Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China","Du, J (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Sch Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",scucity@163.com,,,,,,30,0,0,18,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Graphic images and animations are the most important part of multimedia information expression. It makes our visual effects of three-dimensional representation of things more vivid, like the plane and three-dimensional we usually see. As with the picture, modern multimedia technology transforms our lives into three dimensions, integration, control, interaction and interaction. For the vivid three-dimensional representation of three-dimensional geometric figures in teaching, not only is it limited to the geometric composition of a piece of chalk, but more with the wide application of multimedia technology, multimedia-assisted teaching, especially multimedia-assisted three-dimensional geometric figure teaching is playing more and more The important role, through the aid of multimedia, has cultivated students' spatial abstract thinking ability and ability to understand graphics and theorems. As multimedia becomes more and more concerned by the education community, this paper is about the question of why multimedia technology should be used to assist the teaching and application of solid geometry applications, and how to apply multimedia technology to achieve the maximum value of the teaching effect of stereo geometry. A lot of experimental research has been carried out. Through experiments, we have built a more complete multimedia assistant teaching system, which is beneficial for students to acquire new knowledge on the Internet. The multimedia technology-assisted three-dimensional geometric method is more conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm and initiative of students than the traditional method.

Second, we propose a image recognition method based on deep learning for English letters. Third, we propose a lightweight framework for grading. Based on the above designs, we design an intelligent grading system based on deep learning. We implement the system and the result shows that the intelligent grading system can batch grading efficiently. Besides, compared with related designs, the proposed system is more flexible and intelligent.","[Xiao, Meng] Shenzhen Polytech, Sch Management, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Yi, Haibo] Shenzhen Polytech, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","Yi, HB (corresponding author), Shenzhen Polytech, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",haiboyi@szpt.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China [2018A030310030]; Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, China [2017GkQNCX059]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors received funding from Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (No. 2018A030310030), Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, China (No. 2017GkQNCX059).",,18,0,0,2,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In this paper, we proposed an improved YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) applied Duplex FPN, which enhanced large object detection by utilizing low-level feature information. The conventional YOLOv3 improved the small object detection performance by applying FPN (Feature Pyramid Networks) structure to YOLOv2. However, YOLOv3 with an FPN structure specialized in detecting small objects, so it is difficult to detect large objects. Therefore, this paper proposed an improved YOLOv3 applied Duplex FPN, which can utilize low-level location information in high-level feature maps instead of the existing FPN structure of YOLOv3. This improved the detection accuracy of large objects. Also, an extra detection layer was added to the top-level feature map to prevent failure of detection of parts of large objects. Further, dimension clusters of each detection layer were reassigned to learn quickly how to accurately detect objects. The proposed method was compared and analyzed in the PASCAL VOC dataset. The experimental results showed that the bounding box accuracy of large objects improved owing to the Duplex FPN and extra detection layer, and the proposed method succeeded in detecting large objects that the existing YOLOv3 did not.","[Shin, Seokyong] Kwangwoon Univ, Dept Plasma Bio Display, Seoul, South Korea; [Han, Hyunho] Univ Ulsan, Coll Gen Educ, Ulsan, South Korea; [Lee, Sang Hun] Kwangwoon Univ, Ingenium Coll Liberal Arts, Seoul, South Korea","Lee, SH (corresponding author), Kwangwoon Univ, Ingenium Coll Liberal Arts, Seoul, South Korea.",leesh58@kw.ac.kr,,"Shin, Seokyong/0000-0002-6409-4312",Kwangwoon University,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The present research has been conducted by the Research Grant of Kwangwoon University in 2020.",,25,4,4,44,93,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

According to the idea that the connection between causes and results is the connection between things or phenomena, the retrospective perspective based on the Triple independent teaching mode of sports and the experience and practice beyond point and level are adopted. Based on the characteristics of Triple independent teaching mode and the problems existing in the implementation of Triple independent teaching mode and the countermeasures to solve the problems, two explanatory variables of Triple independent freedom and project diversity of students are extracted. Through the analysis of the two explanatory variables caused by the qualitative comparative analysis method, it is concluded that the main position of Triple independent of students is the effective condition configuration that causes the short board of students' physical health level. The results show that the contradiction between the students' independent choice of curriculum content and the setting of sports events, the contradiction between the students' independent choice of teachers and PE teachers are the main contradiction of the Triple independent Teaching mode and the root of the defect of the Triple independent Teaching mode. The crux of the teaching reform of Triple independent lies in the understanding and interpretation of the subject status of students' Triple independent. The teaching mode of Triple independent in physical education is to teach students in the main position of Triple independent. The virtual teaching objectives and the lack of depth in teaching are the reasons for the short physical health level of students.

Second, proposing the application of this project as an interactive tool to assist in demonstrating the system behaviour, when teaching the new emerging subjects in power engineering courses particularly, Smart Grid. Indeed, the scope of the test facility with the developed simulation tool is specially structured and oriented to education, training and research studies, where problem-based learning can be easily implemented. The electrical test hardware in this design can be operated independently as a multipurpose experimental setup for plug-in electric vehicle. In addition, it can also be interconnected with a small size wind or photovoltaic system to facilitate a complete hybrid integrated platform for testing and model verification. A variety of illustrative examples are presented to show the features of the test facility with its operation and how the components of this facility were selected. Additionally, several test scenarios are depicted using the developed simulation tool, which cover the assessment of grid integration with its components in the event of unforeseen circumstances.

In this paper, an accurate fuzzy inference system scheme which provides fault location results for cross-country faults is presented. The fault information from single end of the parallel transmission line is used. A 400 kV, parallel transmission line is designed in MATLAB while fuzzy inference system scheme is modeled with Fuzzy Logic Toolbox. A MAMDANI type of fuzzy inference system with triangular member functions is modeled for attaining the fault distance. The fault information in voltages and currents is captured. Then, the impedances in each phase is computed and given as input to fuzzy inference system which aims to locate the faulty location. The simulation results attest that it is able to precisely locate faults in transmission lines without justifying the classification. The results are also compared with existing fault-location methods to describe salient features of fuzzy inference system scheme.","[Naresh Kumar, A.] Inst Aeronaut Engn, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Hyderabad, India; [Naresh Kumar, A.] GITAM Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Hyderabad, India; [Sanjay, Ch] GITAM Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Hyderabad, India; [Chakravarthy, M.] Vasavi Coll Engn, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Hyderabad, India","Kumar, AN (corresponding author), Inst Aeronaut Engn, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Hyderabad, India.",ankamnaresh29@gmail.com,"Muktevi, Chakravarthy/AGJ-3133-2022; Kumar, A Naresh/AAF-6887-2019","Kumar, A Naresh/0000-0001-6459-0562",,,,22,37,38,11,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

For this, the optimum amount of reserves should be kept ready, which is one of the serious resources used by the power system to prevent fundamentally unpredictable failures. In this study, while the unit is being allocated, three parameters will be considered in determining the optimum reserve amount, which are the units with production costs, line losses, and reliability. In the system used as 22 Bus, each of these three impressive factors was analysed for the appropriate spinning reserve cost by adding an account and compared with eight different case studies. As a result of the calculations, the most reasonable cost of the result, in which line losses have a very low effect, evaluated in terms of production cost and reliability.

Such courses are either completely free or cost nominally. Generally, the MOOCs face the challenge of not being recognized as 'regular' courses (i.e., the ones taken at the traditional learning institutions). One of the main reasons for this lack of acceptability is the assessment in an unsupervised environment, which is prone to the problems of test-taker's online lookups or interaction with others for finding the answers to the test questions. A few ways of alleviating this problem include: limiting the time for answering the questions, the avoidance of repetitive questions, and the creation of a large number of questions. This paper presents a tool named QAgen that enables the automatic creation of a large number of questions and answers related to different topics in computer/electrical engineering (ECE), computer science, physics, etc. Specifically, the tool is related to the courses on digital logic design, computer architecture, etc. The generated questions are in a format that is suitable both for learning management system (LMS) based and/or non-LMS-based assessment in conventional courses or MOOCs. The proposed tool is based on open-source software, thus eliminating the need for any commercial software packages. The underlying principles of QAgen are applicable to other engineering/science courses as well, if the assessment methods require the creation of some connected-object diagrams, tables and equations. For assessing the usefulness of QAgen, practice question sets were created for three different courses. The student surveys for these courses indicated that the questions helped students prepare for actual tests/examinations. Especially favored by the students was the availability of correct answers at the end of each practice test/examination.","[Beg, Azam; Alhemeiri, Mouza] United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Beg, Ajmal] Cortex Business Solut, Calgary, AB, Canada","Beg, A (corresponding author), United Arab Emirates Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.",abeg@uaeu.ac.ae,,,,,,36,0,0,0,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Computer vision and machine learning based approaches have gained huge attraction in digital image processing field. Several visual computing based techniques have been presented in the past for early prediction of plant leaf diseases. However, detection accuracy is still considered as a challenging task. Hence, in order to overcome this issue, we introduce a novel hybrid approach carried out in three forms. During the first phase, image enhancement and image conversion scheme are incorporated, which helps to overcome the low-illumination and noise related issues. In the next phase, a combined feature extraction technique is developed by using GLCM, Complex Gabor filter, Curvelet and image moments. Finally, a Neuro-Fuzzy Logic classifier is trained with the extracted features. The proposed approach is implemented using MATLAB simulation tool where PlantVillage Database is considered for analysis. The average detection accuracy has been obtained as more than 90% for 2 test cases which shows that the proposed combination of feature extraction and image pre-processing process is able to obtain improved classification accuracy.

As the sensor nodes have the limited processing power, designing energy efficient image transmission is another challenge in this research. This paper proposed a novel method of cooperative image transformation from the transmitter to the receiver for wireless sensor networks. We designed the methods for multi-hop one-way relayed cooperative communication model for wireless sensor networks. We believe that the cooperative communication helps to improve the efficiency of image transmission. The proposed approach focused on efficient relayed image transmission through wireless channels with optimum image quality and bit error rate performances. First, lightweight image quality improvement method was proposed at both transmitter and receiver end as images captured under various illumination conditions. Second, the proposed compressive sensing was performed using the approximation coefficient of 2D discrete wavelet transform. We utilized the wavelet denoising advantage by presenting the hybrid thresholding function. And third, use of decode-forward method at relay nodes to perform the task of decode and forward received image data block. The compressed approximation component of 2D discrete wavelet Transform is further used to apply inverse fast Fourier transform and then in modulation using quadrature phase shift keying to transmit over additive white Gaussian noise channel to relay nodes as per the standard orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing model. The simulation results claim the performance efficiency against the state-of-art methods based on mean square error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and bit error rate.","[Al-Hayani, Bilal; Ilhan, Haci] Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, TR-34217 Istanbul, Turkey","Al-Hayani, B (corresponding author), Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, TR-34217 Istanbul, Turkey.",bilalalhayanil@gmail.com,"Ilhan, Haci/ABA-1968-2020; Alhayani, Bilal/AAM-1142-2020","Alhayani, Bilal/0000-0001-9309-3573",,,,25,76,76,3,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

RLNS in the pitch of large scale integrated circuits, digital signal processing, multimedia, scientific computing and artificial neural network applications have Fixed Width property which has equal number of in and out bit width; hence, these applications need a Fixed Width multiplier. In this paper, a Fixed Width-Floating-Point multiplier based on RLNS was proposed to increase the processing speed. The truncation errors were reduced by using Taylor series. RLNS is the combination of both the residue number system and the logarithmic number system, and uses a table lookup including all bits for expansion. The proposed scheme is effective with regard to speed, area and power utilization in contrast to the design of conservative Floating-Point mathematics designs. Synthesis results were obtained using a Xilinx 14.7 ISE simulator. The area is 16,668 mu m(2), power is 37 mW, delay is 6.160 ns and truncation error can be lessened by 89% as compared with the direct-truncated multiplier. The proposed Fixed Width RLNS multiplier performs with lesser compensation error and with minimal hardware complexity, particularly as multiplier input bits increment.","[Rubia, J. Jency; Kumar, G.

The method proposed in this study reduces this damage. The power state of the generator stage is made equal to the state of the power of the grid in order to prevent the occurrence of a sudden arc. Even if the generator power state is the same with the power state of the generator, an arc can be generated due to a sudden current flow during the transfer. Therefore, the current in the generator stage is controlled to 0 (zero) when transferring, so that the generation of an electrical arc is minimized. In general, when the CTTS system is used for transferring power sources with an emergency generator, the impact from the electrical arc will be momentarily proportional to the amount of the power supplied from the generator to the load. The damage by the arc will make the life of the CTTS system shorter. In order to prevent such damage, a blocking technique using parallel capacitor is constituted. However, this causes arc generation at the time of input. Thus, in this paper, it is proposed to control the effective or ineffective power of the system to zero. To verify the validity of the proposed method, firstly the Powersim simulation was conducted, and after confirming the feasibility based on this, the actual prototype was created and implemented. Zero power control is proposed as a way to improve the stability of CTTS by significantly reducing the generation of an electrical arc. And this technique can help people working on the distributed power or the grid management.","[Seon, Ho-Yun; Yang, Ji-Hoon; Park, Sung-Jun] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Gwang Ju, South Korea; [Lee, Sang-Hun] Dong Eui Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Busan, South Korea; [Park, Seong-Mi] Korea Lift Coll, Dept Lift Engn, Geochang, South Korea","Park, SJ (corresponding author), Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Gwang Ju, South Korea.",sjpark1@jnu.ac.kr,,"Seon, Hoyun/0000-0002-5373-0109",,,,14,0,0,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Students regard it as the most difficult course because of numerous concepts and equations. Philosophy could assist the students' understanding of the electromagnetic theories. The ChineseYin-Yangprinciple reveals the basic composition and operating principles of the universe from the macroscopic and microscopic view, which provides another way to illustrate the electromagnetic phenomenon and equations. This paper presents a heuristic teaching practice carried out by combining the ChineseYin-Yangprinciple and modern electromagnetic theory. Several lectures on vector analysis, electrostatic field, steady magnetic field, time-varying electromagnetic field, and gravitational field, even relativity and particle theories are given to show the application of theYin-Yangprinciple. Student survey and exam results show that the adoption of Yin-Yang principle could help students to acquire the basic concepts in limited teaching hours and to promote philosophical thinking embodied in China's university education.","[Zhang, Wenhao; Wang, Jie] Tongji Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Qu, Shanshan] Shanghai Int Studies Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Zhang, WH (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, 1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",xiwen@tongji.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Wenhao/0000-0003-2429-3189",Shanghai municipal education committee [2019-39]; Tongji University [0800104500],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was sponsored by the Shanghai municipal education committee (2019-39) and Tongji University (0800104500).",,14,1,1,1,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The growth of service industry is still driven mainly by factor input. The resource reconfiguration effect has not yet become the main force driving the growth of TFP of the service industry. However, the structural dividend has become more and more obvious after 2008. The marginal production of capital in most service industries has reached a stage of total reduction and rapid convergence, and there is a convergence of marginal returns of capital within the service industry. The marginal production of labor in most service industries is on the stage of decrease in growth rate and increase in the total amount. Although the marginal production of labor still exhibits divergent characteristics, it has begun to show signs of convergence at the end of the study period.

Since,a person with abnormal behaviour recognition system has reached certain level, their accomplishments in real time applications are restricted by challenges, such as illumination variations. The present visual recognition system is good at controlled illumination conditions and thermal face recognition system is better for detecting disguised persons or when there is no illumination control. Hence, a hybrid system which uses both visual and thermal images for recognising a person is better. The objective of this research is to implement a method which improves the quality of the image by fusing visual and thermal imaging images. Our research methodology has introduced to enhance servo line camera images. Nonlinear image transfer functions were introduced,and the parameters associated with those functions are determined by image statistics for making adaptive algorithms. Next methodswereintroduced for registering the visual images to their consequent thermal images. To get a transformation matrix for the registration, the landmarks in the images are first detected and a subset of those landmarks were selected to obtain the matrix, we propose a hybrid algorithm for detection, tracking and classification using OFSA algorithm to fuse the registered thermal and visual images.

But its final closing time has been controversial. Based on the magmatic age of the surrounding orogenic belt, the source of this set of clastic sediments is determined, which provides new important evidence for the evolution of the South Tianshan orogenic belt. The results show that the Jurassic detrital zircons from the study area were mainly derived from magmatic zircons and are deposited in a proximal source. The detrital zircon age of the Lower Jurassic Badaowan and Sangonghe Formation are concentrated in 290-260 Ma, and in 350-290 Ma and 460-390 Ma, respectively. The detrital zircon age of the Middle Jurassic Xishanyao Formation concentrates in 370-320 Ma and 450-390 Ma. There are very few zircons from the Precambrian period. These ages are consistent with the timing, indicating these clastic sediments were mainly originated from the southern margin of the Yili - Middle Tianshan Block. The Late Permian - Middle Triassic detrital zircons almost do not exist, implying that there were no contemporary magmatism related to collision or post-collision in the South Tianshan district, its complex evolution and orogenic stage are still a challenging topic. In the ancient active plate margin, the sedimentary records in the pre-arc basin can provide more information about the magmatic arc and basin-orogen coupling than the present exposed arc itself. The rhyolite, trachyte, and trachyandesite of the Dahalajunshan Formation were widely developed in the Yili - Middle Tianshan Block during the Early Carboniferous. During the formation of Wulang Formation in the Early Permian, a large number of rhyolite were developed. The age data of 75 detrital zircons were obtained from the sandstone (J1s-5) of the Sangonghe Formation, of which 74 zircons have a concordance degree of over 90%, and their age data also fall on the harmonic curv. In addition, the age of the youngest zircons increased gradually from Early to Middle Jurassic, indicating that the sediments in this period had the feature of uncovering. Our study provides a good reference for the analysis of provenance and regional tectonic evolution.","[Wang, Chao; Shi, Xin] Chengdu Univ Technol, Inst Sedimentary Geol, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chao; Shi, Xin] Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservior Geol & Exploita, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chao] Sinopec Hua Bei Oilfield Serv Corp, Nanyang, Henan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Wenjian; Zhang, Huaisheng] East China Univ Technol, State Key Lab Nucl Resources & Environm, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","Jiang, WJ (corresponding author), East China Univ Technol, State Key Lab Nucl Resources & Environm, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",jiang2017@ecit.cn,,,State Key Laboratory of Nuclear Resources and Environment (East China University of Technology) [NRE 1804],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the Open Fund(NRE 1804) of State Key Laboratory of Nuclear Resources and Environment (East China University of Technology).",,63,0,0,3,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This approach is capable of solving for the basic flow character over a rough wall at high Reynolds numbers without resolving the details of the roughness elements. The wall-modelled LES approach on a smooth wall is proven to be sufficiently precise to predict the velocity profile and wall shear stress. The average roughness shear stress can be combined with the smooth-wall shear stress in the inner-layer wall model by defining a roughness shear stress ratio alpha. The instantaneous shear stresses caused by the roughness elements are calculated by the pressure projection and elevation fields. The total shear stress is fed back to the outer-layer LES mesh as a new boundary condition. The results of the wall-modelled LES correspond well with the experimental data. The comparison between the simulation and experiment reveals that the wall-modelled LES approach presented in this research is capable of predicting the flow in a rough-wall boundary layer without resolving the detailed roughness element geometries.,"[Chen, Binqi] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Aeronaut & Astronaut, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yiding] Sichuan Tengden Technol Co Ltd, Chengdu 610015, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yu] China Aerosp Sci & Technol Corp, Inst Manned Space Syst Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China","Wang, YD (corresponding author), Sichuan Tengden Technol Co Ltd, Chengdu 610015, Peoples R China.",wyding127@163.com,,"Wang, Yiding/0000-0001-7393-980X",,,,18,1,1,2,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

It aims at training skilled talents, which has made great contribution to the economy and industry. Generally, designing courses in high vocational education includes teaching analysis, teaching strategy, teaching practice and teaching assessment. Among the teaching steps, teaching assessment is one of the most important method to improve the quality of course teaching. However, in most high vocational education courses, traditional written exam is still the primary tools of assessments, which can not fulfill the development of high vocational education. In order to improve the quality of high vocational education, it is very urgent to design a practical and efficient system with multiple assessments. We exploit machine learning techniques to design assessment system for high vocation education. Machine learning is a very powerful tool for data analysis and it has been used for education tools in recent years. First, we improve the teaching organization for training skilled talents. Second, we propose a feature selection model based on the improved teaching organization. Third, we propose a machine learning model for teaching assessment. With the main contributions and other improvements, we design a multi-assessment system for vocational teaching based on machine learning. We implement the multi-assessment system by using Python and TensorFlow, which shows that the system can provide practical and efficient multiple assessments for vocational teaching based on training machine learning model. Compared with other assessment methods, machine learning based multi-assessment is more intelligent and automatic.

The results show that in the tripartite game, the more the expected revenue of government departments, enterprises, and the public increases, the more likely it is that the government departments will adopt a strict supervision strategy and the company will choose to assume social responsibility. The higher the cost of government supervision, the higher the cost of corporate social responsibility, and the more the loss of social welfare. Then the government department adopts a general regulatory strategy, and the company chooses not to assume social responsibility, the more likely the public will give negative evaluation of the company. The conclusion is that the strict supervision of the government supervision department has greatly increased the penalty 'cost of enterprises' failure to perform social responsibility. This helps enterprises to consciously perform social responsibility, and thus get positive comments from the public.","[Zhao, Xin; Zhao, Hong] Tianjin Polytech Univ, Tianjin 300160, Peoples R China","Zhao, H (corresponding author), Tianjin Polytech Univ, Tianjin 300160, Peoples R China.",289242785@qq.com,,,Tianjin Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project An Empirical Study on the Evaluation of Corporate Social Responsibility and Relative Performance in the Context of `New Age' [TJGLQN18-010],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by Tianjin Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project An Empirical Study on the Evaluation of Corporate Social Responsibility and Relative Performance in the Context of `New Age' (Grant no.

During emergency evacuation, the pace of the crowd and the effective width of the roads are closely relevant. At present, there are differences in the setting of effective width of road in the central business district at home and abroad, and they pay more attention to the general traffic value of road, without too much research and exploration on the setting of effective width of road in emergency evacuation. In the case of limited space resources, it is increasingly important to study the effect of effective width of road on pedestrian evacuation in the central business district. Based on this, this paper conducts Research measure on the effective width of road, business center of the Three Gorges Square in Chongqing. After research measuring, it is modally analyzed according to relevant regulation. The result of the research shows that the main pedestrian road of Three Gorges Square can't meet the demands of the urgent evacuation.

Unlike the previous studies presented in the literature, the proposed method takes into account the excitation voltage limit and therefore formulates a new objective function for optimal PID parameters design. The practical aspect of the proposed constraint is significant since the generator field winding can be seriously damaged in case of the large excitation voltage. The performance of the proposed controller using the solution methodology proposed in this study and its contribution to the robustness of the control system are investigated. Further, the obtained PID parameters are used to simulate the AVR dynamics for a large step change in the generator's voltage set-point. Besides, the obtained step responses have been compared with the corresponding responses of the AVR system whose PID parameters are determined by using well-known methods presented in the literature. Also, the proposed AEO-PID controller shows superior performances in the case of uncertainties in the AVR system's parameters, as well as in the presence of the different disturbances in the system. The results obtained show that the obtained parameters provided a more secure and stable machine operation even with changes of the reference, generator, or excitation voltage signals compared with the performance of the controllers obtained by the previous works presented in the literature. Furthermore, AEO has proven its ability to get optimal solutions in a fast and efficient manner in terms of accuracy and time spent per iteration.","[Calasan, Martin; Micev, Mihailo] Univ Montenegro, Fac Elect Engn, Podgorica 81000, Montenegro; [Djurovic, Zeljko] Univ Belgrade, Sch Elect Engn, Belgrade, Serbia; [Mageed, Hala M.

However, with the rapid development of financial industry, the income of urban and rural residents is increasingly unbalanced. The increasing income gap between urban and rural areas has caused a large number of adverse phenomena in the process of economic development, seriously affecting the income distribution of the people and even causing social instability. Therefore, in today's big data era, it is necessary to systematically study and analyze the impact of financial industry development on the national income gap between urban and rural areas. At the same time, it is of great significance to improve the problem of excessive income gap between urban and rural areas. This paper mainly analyses the relationship between the three effects of the development of financial industry and the income gap between urban and rural residents. In the empirical aspect, the paper creatively uses the fuzzy Kmeans clustering algorithm to regression analysis the panel data of a certain area from 2010 to 2018. At the same time, in the empirical data analysis, this paper creatively replaces the European norm measure of the Kmeans clustering algorithm with the AE measure, and puts forward a proposal. The index of financial development level is based on the proportion of loans from financial institutions. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, this paper draws the following conclusions: the financial scale in the financial industry will have a huge impact on the income gap between urban and rural areas. Finally, based on the above problems and current situation, this paper puts forward relevant improvement suggestions.","[Li, Yao] Haikou Univ Econ, Sch Business Adm, Haikou 571127, Hainan, Peoples R China","Li, Y (corresponding author), Haikou Univ Econ, Sch Business Adm, Haikou 571127, Hainan, Peoples R China.",liyao1005@163.com,,,special project of philosophy and social sciences of Hainan Province: Research on Optimization and Adjustment of Industrial Structure in Hainan Province Constrained by Resources and Environment [HNSK(YB)19-44]; planned project of philosophy and social sciences of Hainan Province: The Innovative Research on the Evolution of Island Ecological Civilization and the Division of Green Industry Recycling Type [HNSK(ZX)18-118],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was awarded the special project of philosophy and social sciences of Hainan Province: Research on Optimization and Adjustment of Industrial Structure in Hainan Province Constrained by Resources and Environment (Grant No. HNSK(YB)19-44) and the planned project of philosophy and social sciences of Hainan Province: The Innovative Research on the Evolution of Island Ecological Civilization and the Division of Green Industry Recycling Type (Grant No. HNSK(ZX)18-118).",,18,2,2,8,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Several disastrous earthquakes have proved that seismic safety evaluation may underestimate seismic risks, which would result in serious damage of bridge structures. Therefore, a new higher level of seismic hazard named Very Rare Ground Motion (VRGM for short) is proposed innovatively to be considered in this paper for very important bridges. A novel seismic design method of simply supported girder bridges in the transverse direction for VRGMs is proposed at first. In the proposed method, seismic isolation bearings, tension-only braces and ductile piers are combined to improve the seismic performance and meet seismic requirements of VRGMs. Taking a simply supported girder bridge as a numerical analysis example, the proposed method is compared with two bridge seismic design methods adopted in current seismic codes and its parametric analysis is conducted. It's shown that the proposed seismic design method can combine the ductility capacities of piers and the functions of seismic isolation bearings and reduce all the concerned structural seismic responses in VRGMs effectively. This work provides an educational demonstration for engineers dealing with similar problems.","[Peng, Tianbo; Zou, Haoyu] Tongji Univ, State Key Lab Disaster Reduct Civil Engn, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Peng, Tianbo; Zou, Haoyu] Tongji Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lizhi] Hengshui Rubber Gen Factory Co Ltd, Hengshui, Peoples R China","Peng, TB (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, State Key Lab Disaster Reduct Civil Engn, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",ptb@tongji.edu.cn,,"Zou, Haoyu/0000-0002-2002-9033","Ministry of Science and Technology of China [SLDRCE19-B-21]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51278372, 51878489]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported partly by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, Grant No. SLDRCE19-B-21 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51278372 and No. 51878489).",,24,0,0,6,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

A correct understanding of fields and its distribution is necessary to understand the working, design and optimization of electrical machines. This paper presents a finite element method (FEM) based educational tool that allows the technical students to visualize electromagnetic (EM) fields inside the EM systems. This tool therefore provides a better understanding of the design and optimization of various electrical devices. This paper shows an example of a 2-pole linear machine to visualize the distribution of the magnetic field in a non-linear circuit. This machine extends to form a linear switched reluctance motor (LSRM) using step-by-step design and optimization procedure along with the user guide interface programmed in FEM based ANSYS Maxwell software. This motor is used as an example to visualize magnetic fields using FEM software in complex circuits and can be used as a good educational tool for students.

The aim of the learning model is to reduce the affective gap, that extracts the objects and background features of an image semantically, such as high-level and low-level features. These extracted features accompanied with few others and it is more effective in emotion prediction model based on visual concepts of image, that leads to better emotion recognition performance.

As the harmonic content increases, higher core loss and eddy current loss in the windings results in higher operating temperatures. It causes magnetic flux density in the core to increase and shifts the operating point through the saturated region. This phenomenon is mostly taught in undergraduate education as theoretical information. However, as a difficult concept to understand, harmonics phenomenon might be taught by using experiments for active learning, visualizing the effects in a laboratory setting, and making the connection between theoretical and practical applications for deeper and meaningful learning. In this study, a teaching method for effects of harmonics is proposed and phase shift between the fundamental and harmonic component of the supply voltage on the transformer B-H characteristic in a laboratory application is introduced by an experimental work performed on toroidal transformers.

The inductance is a key design parameter in tracks of electronic devices, power transmission and distribution systems, and lightning, grounding, and bonding systems. Inductance highly relies on the problem geometry, and under AC supply, it is also influenced by skin and proximity effects. The inductance significantly determines voltage drop in conductors, thus increasing reactive power consumption and limiting conductors' ampacity. Although this is an important topic, it is seldom studied in detail in undergraduate and even in graduate physics and engineering studies. To this end, this paper compares the results provided by existing closed formulas for simple conductors' configurations with those attained through two-dimensional finite element method simulations. Finite element method based simulations are increasingly being incorporated in the syllabuses of graduate and undergraduate courses due to their accurate solutions and flexibility, since finite element method models can be applied in a wide range of electrical frequencies and configurations, some of which do not have an analytical solution.

The project is designed by students and teachers .The research shows that the reduction of cross-border time has a positive effect on China's agricultural products export, but the promoting effect is weakened by the negative impact of technical trade measures for agricultural products. Further research shows that the effect of cross-border time reduction on Chinese agricultural products export is heterogeneous. Due to the negative impact of technical trade measures for agricultural products, the cross-border time reduction in developed countries has a strong role in promoting China's agricultural exports; while the cross-border time reduction in non-developed countries has no significant role to promote Chinese agricultural products export, and the technical trade measures involving agricultural product have no inhibiting effect on the promotion of cross-border time reduction. The empirical test also proves the effectiveness of the above research project. Therefore, for the aim to strengthen the export of Chinese agricultural products to the above-mentioned countries, China should not only take advantage of the positive impact of trade facilitation, but also effectively resolve the negative impact of technical trade measures for agricultural products.

The authors developed and analyzed four market models, no IR enter and no brand remanufacture (n), no IR enter and brand remanufacture (nR), IR enter and no brand manufacture (nr), and IR enter and brand remanufacture (nrR). They then analyzed the results using sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis. The research found that new product prices, brand remanufactured product prices, and general re-product prices are positively correlated with brand loyalty; with the increasing level of brand loyalty, brand manufacturers' profit increases, while the IR's profit is lowered. Further, when the manufacturing costs of new products are high, the model preference for the brand manufacturers is always nR > nrR > n > nr; when the costs are lower, the level of the consumer brand loyalty affects the model preference. In models nr and nrR, brand loyalty may increase the brand consumer surplus, but reduces the average consumer surplus, total consumer surplus, and total social welfare.","[Peng, Gao; Jian-Guo, Du; Bin-Xin, Zhu] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Management, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Peng, Gao] Jiangsu Univ Technol, Sch Business, Changzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wei-Dong, Huang] Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Nanjing, Peoples R China","Wei-Dong, H (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Management, Nanjing 210003, Peoples R China.",uangwd@njupt.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71671093]; Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education; Key Research Base of Philosophy and Social Sciences; Jiangsu Province University Philosophy and Social Sciences Outstanding Innovation Team Construction Project; Special Funds of the National Social Science Fund of China [18VSJ038],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Work described in this paper was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71671093.

This paper aims to explore the psychosocial path of people participating in the collective action of NIMBY conflict, and to provide theoretical basis for effective governance of NIMBY conflict. By integrating the psychosocial explanatory variables related to collective action, we construct a regulated double mediation Model, which is empirically tested with 566 questionnaires from the NIMBY conflict in gaoling, China. The results show that: group relative deprivation, group emotions and group effectiveness have positive effects on people's NIMBY conflict participation tendency; group effectiveness and group emotions are important mediating variables of group relative deprivation affecting people's NIMBY conflict participation tendency; group identity has a positive adjustment effect on people's group emotions, group effectiveness, and the participation tendency of NIMBY conflict. The research indicates that group relative deprivation is the key precursor of NIMBY conflict, group emotion is the key factor driving the deterioration of NIMBY conflict, and group identity is the key factor catalyzing the occurrence of NIMBY conflict. This study helps to explain the psychological mechanism of people's participation in NIMBY conflict, and has certain implications for the prevention and governance of NIMBY conflict.","[Guo, Bin] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Publ Adm, Xian 710055, Peoples R China; [Li, KunJi] Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Management, Xian, Peoples R China","Li, KJ (corresponding author), Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Publ Adm, Xian 710055, Peoples R China.",376119298@qq.com,,,,,,22,0,0,14,46,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Based on Amartya Sen's theory of capability, this paper selects part-time farmers' six welfare functional activities after rural land transfer, including family economic status, social security, health and leisure, social demand, psychological condition and occupational status. A multidimensional welfare measure model of having uneven distribution sensitive and satisfying Subgroup Conformance and path independence is used to measure the part-time farmers' welfare changes after rural land transfer. The results show that the comprehensive welfare level of part-time farmers has improved before and after rural land transfer. From the sub dimension index, the welfare level of family economic situation, psychological condition and occupational status has increased obviously, the change of social security welfare level is not significant, the welfare level of health and leisure and social demand has declined, and the welfare loss of various dimensions is increased, which indicates that the welfare distribution of part-time farmers after rural land transfer is more unbalanced. Therefore, it is suggested that the welfare level of the part-time farmers can be improved by improving the rural social security, increasing the training of farmers' employment knowledge, and providing non-agricultural employment opportunities, thus promoting the sustainable development of rural land transfer.","[Bin, Guo; He, Dongliang] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Sch Management, Xian, Peoples R China","He, DL (corresponding author), Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Xian 710055, Peoples R China.",hedl@live.xauat.edu.cn,,,,,,20,1,1,11,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In view of the variety of controllable resources in microgrid, multi-agent microgrid coordination control architecture is used to control the multi-layer coordination of microgrid, and simulation is built to analyze four different scenes. The results show that in the microgrid load, it is found that the valley peak difference is the smallest when both the electric vehicle and the conventional load participate in the demand response (scene 4). In the change of SOC and charge discharge power of battery energy storage system, it is found that four scenes make the energy storage function of low storage and high generation play an effective role. In the economic and environmental benefits of microgrid daily operation, it is found that the daily operation cost and environmental benefits of scene 4 are significantly lower than that of scene 1. Therefore, in this study, the coordinated optimization method of integrating electric vehicle into microgrid based on multi-agent microgrid can effectively solve the coordinated optimization of multi controllable resources of microgrid, and provide experimental basis for the subsequent development and optimization of microgrid.","[Liu, Jijun] Taiyuan Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Taiyuan 030000, Peoples R China","Liu, JJ (corresponding author), Taiyuan Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Taiyuan 030000, Peoples R China.",94582967@qq.com,,,,,,17,0,0,1,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

To start with, the basic principle of fuzzy theory is analyzed, and the focus is on studying the membership function and the lambda-cut-set knowledge. Following that, the fuzzy clustering method and its process are studied. Finally, fuzzy evaluation is used to build the membership function after experiment on the MATLAB platform to evaluate the environmental quality. The fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm is used to realize the target identification of environmental data. In the process of fuzzy clustering, fuzzy evaluation of the seawater quality is realized, and the redundant data of the monitoring station are removed. Through experiment and analysis, experimental results are in line with the practical situations and show a high consistency with the data characteristics.

The strength and stability of vegetation concrete would be reduced when it is used in areas where freeze-thaw cycles occur frequently. For exploring the changes of structural properties of vegetation concrete under freeze-thaw cycles, an indoor simulation experiment of vegetation concrete samples containing 25 and 30% water content was carried out, so as to test the changes of specimen surface, volume, ultrasonic wave velocity, shearing strength, and microscopic structure. The microstructural parameters were analyzed quantitatively with Image-Pro Plus software. The experimental results indicated that as cycles of freeze-thaw grow, the macroscopic changes of samples included steadily rising surface crack rate, increasing first and then decreasing volume, greatly reducing ultrasonic wave velocity and gradually decreasing shear strength. The inner structure of samples slowly deteriorated from overall dense to dispersed with decreasing cement hydration crystals, pores resulting from dispersion and destruction of bulky grains, higher surface porosity, and smoother particles in microscopic aspect. When compared with samples containing 25% water content, the microstructure of the 30% water content sample was more affected by the freeze-thaw cycle, and its structural weakening effect was more obvious. Reduced cement hydration crystals, lower inter-particle bonding force, and increase in the number of large pores were the main causes of degradation of vegetation concrete structure. Electrical engineering students can refer to the analysis methods in this paper to evaluate the structural performance of any electrical engineering material.","[Gao, Jiazhen; Zhou, Mingtao; Xu, Wennian; Liu, Daxiang; Du, Ying] China Three Gorges Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Geohazards & Ecoenvironm T, Yichang, Peoples R China; [Gao, Jiazhen; Zhou, Mingtao; Xu, Wennian; Liu, Daxiang; Du, Ying] China Three Gorges Univ, Hubei Key Lab Disaster Prevent & Mitigat, Yichang, Peoples R China; [Peng, Songtao] China Three Gorges Univ, Minist Educ, Engn Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Three Gorges Reservoir R, Yichang, Peoples R China; [Shen, Jian] Huadian Tibet Energy Co Ltd, Lhasa, Tibet, Peoples R China","Zhou, MT (corresponding author), China Three Gorges Univ, Yichang 443002, Peoples R China.",zmt@ctgu.edu.cn,,"Gao, Jiazhen/0000-0002-3421-8329","CRSRI Open Research Program [CKWV2017514/KY]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0504902-02]; Research Fund for Excellent Dissertation of China Three Gorges University [2019BSPY007]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51708333, 51678348]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the CRSRI Open Research Program (Grant: CKWV2017514/KY), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant: 2017YFC0504902-02), the Research Fund for Excellent Dissertation of China Three Gorges University (Grant: 2019BSPY007), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants: 51708333, 51678348).",,22,0,0,11,36,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

However, a lot of video smoke detection approach involves minimum lighting and it can be required for the cameras to discover the existence of smoke particles in a scene. Eliminating such challenges, our proposed work introduces a novel concept like hybrid reinforcement deep Q learning classifier of smoke detection. This work takes the correct decision about the smoke particles via reinforcement deep Q learning and classifies the smoke particle with the deep convolutional neural network. The proposed real-time algorithm is aimed to provide proper education for the engineers to detect moving objects for the purpose of developing surveillance systems. This method is also helpful for the beginners who have keen interest in the field of deep learning to control fire. Here, to observe the temporal variance of fire smoke, spatial analysis is identified in the present frame and in the subsequence of the video, spatio-temporal analysis has been taken into account. Finally, smoke particles are classified with the novel reinforcement Q learning-based classifier and experimental results show a better performance regarding classification accuracy. So we can detect smoke successfully with the novel method. The main purpose of this work is to describe and formalize a machine learning -based smoke detection algorithm that can be used by students.","[Matlani, Princy; Shrivastava, Manish] Guru Ghasidas Univ, Comp Sci & Engn, Bilaspur 495009, Chhattisgarh, India","Matlani, P (corresponding author), Guru Ghasidas Univ, Comp Sci & Engn, Bilaspur 495009, Chhattisgarh, India.",princy.matlani@gmail.com,,,,,,31,1,1,3,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In 3D-integrated circuit fabrication, congestion, and wirelength minimization are challenging processes. To overcome these problems, we proposed a novel optimization approach for useful partitioning, placement, and routing. Our proposed work consists of four significant stages, including partitioning, placement, routing, and fault diagnosis in through silicon via and spare through silicon via allocation. Firstly, the QuadTree partitioning method executed by the partitioning process. QuadTree method partitions the layer into four subdivisions and remains until it finds no space for partitioning. AND logic is proposed to overcome the congestion problem during placement. In the second stage, the functioning of the hybrid particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing algorithm proposed by the placement process. Particle swarm optimization computes fitness function for six constraints, specifically wirelength, area, power, cross talk, temperature, and delay. The simulated annealing places circuits in the specified area with the computed fitness function. In every 45 degrees, Kruskal's based octi-linear Steiner tree algorithm that establishes routes performs the routing by the third stage. In the last stage, fault detection in through silicon via and spare through silicon via allocation processes are executed using the support vector machine algorithm and dedicated switch. Support vector machine classifies the TSV into two, which includes regular and redundant through silicon via. The spare through silicon via allocation performed by using a dedicated switch. Finally, the proposed work evaluated based on metrics such as wire length, area, temperature, delay, and run time.","[Radhakrishnan Nair, Radeep Krishna; Pothiraj, Sivakumar] Kalasalingam Acad Res & Educ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Krishnankoil 626126, Tamil Nadu, India; [Radhakrishnan Nair, T.

Bolt supporting reinforcement works effectively in enhancing the rock in underground engineering. In this study, the roofs made of the horizontally layered rock were simplified to the rock plate structure with two different constrains, and a cusp catastrophe model was established based on the structural mechanics. With the application of the developed cusp catastrophe model, the influences of ratio of span to thickness, the amounts, and the preload of the bolts on the stability of the stratified rock were studied. Findings show that the installation of bolts can increase the anti-bulking capacity of the layered rock. The bolts can change the failure of the layered rock from bulking failure to shear failure. Improving the integrity of the layered rock is also helpful for enhancing the resistance to the bulking instability.","[Du, Ming R.; Jing, Hong W.] China Univ Min & Technol, State Key Lab Geomech & Deep Underground Engn, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Pan, Bing] Power China Huadong Engn Corp Ltd, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Jing, HW (corresponding author), China Univ Min & Technol, State Key Lab Geomech & Deep Underground Engn, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jinghwskl@163.com,,"Jing, Hongwen/0000-0002-4597-2183",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017BSCXA22]; Graduate student scientific research innovation projects in Jiangsu province [KYCX17_1529],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors acknowledge the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2017BSCXA22) and Graduate student scientific research innovation projects in Jiangsu province (KYCX17_1529).",,40,0,0,7,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Performance of the power system comprising of conventional sources like hydro and thermal generating units is evaluated by cascaded fuzzy PD-PI controller optimised by grasshopper optimization algorithm. The potential of grasshopper optimization algorithm is validated by comparing with other algorithms. Further, load-frequency response is studied by penetrating solar-thermal and wind power generating units into the recommended system. The power system integrated with renewable sources puts forth a great stability challenge in the wake of high load perturbation. Hence, a robust secondary controller named cascaded fuzzy PD-PI controller is designed by endorsing a profound grasshopper optimization algorithm technique, to tackle this stability challenge. The credibility of the cascaded fuzzy PD-PI controller with/without nonlinearities presented in the system is validated by comparing the results obtained from proportional-integral-derivative and fuzzy-proportional-integral-derivative controllers.

Solar and wind are readily available sources which will minimize the cost of electricity if implemented properly. Considering the weather and other relevant advantages, solar energy is a favorable option for a particular site. But it is extremely difficult for the implementation of the suggested renewable energy in a site which already has specific resources and existing infrastructure to replace. Several factors should be counted in for the selection and implementation of appropriate renewable source for fulfilling the demand. As a possible energy option, on-grid infrastructure is selected looking at its low necessity of development and hardware cost. This paper aims to impart the detailed designs of alternative energy options that will offset the annual irrigation costs of the Rainbow Youth Golf Education Program in Klamath County. Using simulator, a practical modeling of the system is performed to look at the cost associated with each case. After selecting a combination with the minimum cost, it is shown that the model decreases the irrigation cost compared to previous year. Other technological implications are also evaluated.

First, the image restoration technology is described, as well as its advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. Second, the deep learning algorithm based on artificial neural network is described and analyzed. Finally, the deep learning algorithm is integrated into the digital repair technology, and a mural restoration method based on the generalized regression neural network is proposed. The morphological expansion method and anisotropic diffusion method are used to preprocess the image. The MATLAB software is used for the simulation analysis and evaluation of the image restoration effect. The results show that in the restoration of the original image, the accuracy of the digital image restoration technology is not high. The nontexture restoration technology is not applicable in the repair of large-scale texture areas. The predicted value of the mural restoration effect based on the generalized neural network is closer to the true value. The anisotropic diffusion method has a significant effect on the processing of image noise. In the image similarity rate, the different number of training samples and smoothing parameters are compared and analyzed. It is found that when the value of delta is small, the number of training samples should be increased to improve the accuracy of the prediction value. If the number of training samples is small, a larger value of delta is needed to get a better prediction effect, and the best restoration effect is obtained for the restored image. Through this study, it is found that this study has a good effect on the restoration model of Dunhuang murals. It provides experimental reference for the restoration of later murals.","[She, Wenjing] Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Sch Art & Design, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China","She, WJ (corresponding author), Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Sch Art & Design, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.",shewj@mail.lzjtu.cn,,,key research project of Industrial Green Low Carbon Transformation and Upgrade in Gansu Province in 2019 (Research on Green and Environmentally friendly Heavy Color Pigments production of Digital Improvement) [GGLD-2019-039],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was part of the key research project of Industrial Green Low Carbon Transformation and Upgrade in Gansu Province in 2019 (Research on Green and Environmentally friendly Heavy Color Pigments production of Digital Improvement) (GGLD-2019-039).",,27,4,4,7,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This issue complicates the process of supply and demand balancing because the electrical energy generated by photovoltaic arrays cannot be directly stored. Energy storage systems provide a solution to this issue by storing the excess energy generated during peak generation time which will be delivered to the grid during peak load, increasing system energy efficiency. In this work, the possibility of utilizing a Megawatt scale energy storage system, such as a battery bank, to improve the efficiency of a proposed 10-MW Biglow Canyon solar array through solar peak shaving is discussed in detail. With an overview of the benefits of peak shaving and a comparative study of energy storage technologies, an assessment of the most suitable commercially available storage systems is broadly discussed in the paper. Three control algorithms based on battery storage, state of charge, and constant output are proposed to balance the difference between generation and usage using appropriate energy storage system.

Wind certainly emerges as one of the most plausible energy sources in modern power generation. However, large-scale wind energy is associated with fluctuations in voltage and power due to its intermittent nature. The proposed pumped hydroelectric energy storage system offers one of the best solutions in solving this problem. It is shown that large-scale integration of wind energy becomes more feasible and efficient when a proper energy storage system is added to achieve appropriate energy charging or discharging. Upon comparing the potential of different storage systems, pumped hydroelectric energy storage is found to be highly promising for wind integration. In order to demonstrate the behavior of the integrated system with respect to time constant and to verify the feasibility of the energy storage in different case studies, simulations are performed in Matlab/Simulink.

However, the current unclear benefits of prefabricated buildings have led to great constraints on its development in China. Therefore, in order to clarify the comprehensive benefit level of prefabricated buildings and promote the development of prefabricated buildings, the comprehensive benefits of prefabricated buildings are analyzed from four aspects of economy, environment, society, and security, and 19 evaluation indexes of economic benefits, environmental benefits, social benefits, and safety benefits of prefabricated buildings are selected from the life cycle dimension in this paper. The comprehensive benefits of prefabricated buildings are constructed by using set pair analysis theory. Finally, through the analysis of the prefabricated building project in Hefei, the feasibility of the model was verified, and comprehensive benefit level of prefabricated buildings in Hefei was further judged. This paper provides a feasible and operable evaluation model for the comprehensive benefit evaluation of prefabricated buildings and also provides a theoretical support for the development of prefabricated buildings.","[Zhao Weishu; Zhang Beibei; Yang Yang] Anhui Jianzhu Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Hefei, Peoples R China","Zhao, WS (corresponding author), Anhui Jianzhu Univ, Hefei 230022, Peoples R China.",jyzws@126.com,,,Anhui University Humanities and Social Sciences Research Project: Research on the Comprehensive Benefits of Prefabricated Buildings [SK2018A0568],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Anhui University Humanities and Social Sciences Research Project: Research on the Comprehensive Benefits of Prefabricated Buildings (Grant no: SK2018A0568).",,12,6,6,87,182,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

At present, there are relatively few research data and the research method is relatively single. Therefore, collecting panel data on China's 31 provinces from 2003 to 2016, this paper conducts an empirical analysis on the influence of patent level on outward foreign direct investment via analytical method of equal part linear regression and Grey Computing. By comparing analysis results with the model and the results with conventional linear regression model, the difference of different regression models is observed.

A new compensating regular term is designed, which can perform anisotropic and isotropic diffusion in image denoising, thus making up for insufficient diffusion in the total variation model. The algorithm first uses local standard deviation to distinguish neighborhood types. Then, the anisotropic diffusion based on L-1 norm plays the role of edge protection in the strong edge region. The anisotropic and the isotropic diffusion simultaneously exist in the smooth region, so that the weak textures can be protected while overcoming the staircase effect effectively. The simulation experiments show that this method can effectively improve the peak signal-to-noise ratio and obtain the higher structural similarity index and the shorter running time.","[Zhang, Liqiong; Li, Min; Qiu, Xiaohua] Xian High Tech Res Inst, Xian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Liqiong; Qiu, Xiaohua] Engn Univ Peoples Armed Police, Xian, Peoples R China","Zhang, LQ (corresponding author), Xian High Tech Res Inst, Dept Comp, Xian 710025, Peoples R China.",zhanglqwj@163.com,,,,,,31,0,0,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The proposed pedagogical approach is based on the systematic learning through evidence-based teaching, knowledge mobilization, and research strategies. In our approach, it is recommended to use two platforms, mu Vision (simulator) and one microcontroller (hardware), such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi is a small single-board computer, which can be used as a brain for innovative computing projects, such as network monitoring tool, at a reasonable cost. Arduino is the most popular microcontroller (based on the ATmega328), which is a flexible and easy-to-use device for conducting various embedded systems projects. Those platforms have been used for many embedded systems projects, including home automation, Internet of Things, robots, games, and servers. We evaluated our proposed three modules based on student performance and feedback. As a result, we conclude that the proposed modules work better than a traditional learning methodology.","[Chu, Yul] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Elect Engn, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA; [Park, Jin H.] Calif State Univ Fresno, Dept Comp Sci, Fresno, CA 93740 USA","Chu, Y (corresponding author), Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Elect Engn, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.",mark.chu@utrgv.edu,,,,,,7,1,1,3,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

However, when the energy is exchanged between AC side and DC side or vice versa, the fluctuation in the capacitor used in deputize unit is unavoidable. The fluctuation in the deputize unit is due to the increase in the total harmonic distortion by the capacitor in the output voltages. This total harmonic distortion is evaded by exploring the deputize unit capacitor voltage mathematically. This paper proposes the enhanced frequency shift carrier modulation in H-bridge multilevel converter to suppress the influence of fluctuation in deputize unit capacitor voltages. Enhanced frequency shift carrier modulation is considered for nonlinear compensation. The principal results of using this enhanced frequency shift carrier modulation improvise the total harmonic distortion in the output voltage of H-bridge multilevel converter. Simulation and experimental results are done using MATLAB/SIMULINK to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","[Yuvaraja, T.; Kumar, K. A.

The study adopted correlation research design and the structured questionnaire was used to collect data from the respondent. However, the study found that the electrical/electronic trade teachers experienced high job stress, experienced low satisfaction in their teaching profession and exhibited high job performances. The study found positive correlation between work stress and job satisfaction, between work stress and job performances and between job satisfaction and job performances. It was obtained from the result that age, gender and experience did not statistically influence work stress, job satisfaction and job performances. Meanwhile, the type of teacher significantly influences work stress and job satisfaction. It is recommended that more qualified teachers should be employed for the teachers to be more relieved of their duties which can lead to work stress.

The method based on feature translation is relatively simple and can obviously improve the clustering effect of multilingual text. Due to the time and space complexity of the method itself and other inherent defects, the final result of the method based on potential semantic indexing is unsatisfactory.

Finally, the modified Bayesian network model is used to calculate the probability of fire developing to different stages, and the estimated value of property loss is used to express the severity of the accident and calculate the fire risk value.

The large population is affected by diabetic retinopathy and hence research in the area of automated screening has acquired major research interest in the scientific community. The diagnosing features for diabetic retinopathy comprises of identifying deformations of minute blood vessel in form of exudates and its features occurring in and around the regions of fundus which will result into exudes, hemorrhages, or microaneurysms. This feature is often hard to be classified by naked eyes and need trained personnel for close inspection before making diagnosis. Therefore, a comprehensive machine learning tool is in the demand for automated diabetic retinopathy detection. Neural networks have given promising results in the field of classification. Therefore, we present a hybrid neural network-based method with realistic clinical potential. In this study, we present a neuro-fuzzy technique, which is developed for identification of exudates in retinal images and is utilized for the extraction of essential features from the retinal images of patient's eyeballs. We trained this hybrid neural network base technique over a set of 25,600 training images for color retinal images and tested it over 12,000 testing image set for binocular model.

Cyclone is one of the dangerous natural catastrophes that several researchers have undergone research over it, and many technologies were developed to find accurate results for its prediction. Several algorithms were proposed for classifying the cyclone data in terms of latitude, longitude, wind speed, and pressure. Still, it is a significant challenge for most of the researchers for predicting the accurate measurement and observations for cyclonic data. In this paper, a hybrid model is proposed, which is a combination of Genetic Algorithm and XP boost for predicting cyclone severity. The data are collected from the Bay of Bengal Ocean, which has been used in the proposed model for classification.

Many studies focus on the process of vacuum application but the process of vacuum removal is generally ignored. Different from observations on surcharge preloading, ground settlement rather than heave occurred during vacuum removal. In this study, a stress-controlled triaxial test was carried out to simulate both processes of vacuum application and removal applied on a clayey soil and hence the mechanism of ground settlement induced by vacuum removal is discussed. Compressive axial strain was observed during the decrease of isotropic stress that simulated vacuum removal. To better understand the observed deformation characteristics of the clayey soils during vacuum removal, in this study, a simple anisotropic elastic model was used. The happening of ground settlement of the clayey soil during vacuum removal is mainly because that the Young's modulus in the vertical direction is higher than that in the horizontal direction. Lateral extension is dominant for the ground deformation during vacuum removal.","[Liu, Jian; Liang, Chuanyang; Wu, Yuedong] Hohai Univ, Geotech Res Inst, Key Lab Minist Educ Geomech & Embankment Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Rui] Harbin Inst Technol, Shenzhen Sch, Shenzhen Key Lab Urban & Civil Engn Disaster Prev, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Mei, Guoxiong] Guangxi Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Key Lab Disaster Prevent & Struct Safety, Minist Educ, Nanning, Peoples R China","Chen, R (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Shenzhen Sch, Shenzhen Key Lab Urban & Civil Engn Disaster Prev, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",chenrui1005@hotmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51608152, 51322807]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2019B73814]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province China [2016A030310368]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0404803]; Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [SJKY19_0449]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors thank for the support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos 51608152 and No. 51322807), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2018b00714 and 2015B25914), the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province China (No. 2016A030310368), National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2017YFC0404803), Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (No. SJKY19_0449) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2019B73814).",,28,0,0,1,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

It is found that the gap of quality is more severe than that of quantity in China. The quality gap between East China and West China is the greatest, while the quantity gap is smaller, which indicates that China should pay attention to the utilization rate of highway resources while emphasizing the rational allocation, and check whether the supply of resources in the regions with busy and developed logistics services meets the demand while promoting economic growth by improving traffic accessibility.","[Sheng, Xin] Jiangsu Open Univ, Sch Business, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Sheng, Xin] Guangzhou Panyu Polytech, Sch Management, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Lin, Xiaoci; Wu, Zeying; Chen, Jiayi; Liu, Biyu; Zhong, Zuchang] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Business, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Deng, Lijun] Fuzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou, Peoples R China","Deng, LJ (corresponding author), Fuzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou, Peoples R China.",dlj7425@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673064]; Innovation team project (HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES) of universities in Guangdong [2017WCXTD003]; Philosophy and Social Sciences in Guangzhou [2018GZGJ194]; Yangcheng young scholars' Foundation [17QNXR12]; Social Sciences Planning Project of the Panyu Polytechnic [2016SK007],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant: 71673064), Innovation team project (HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES) of universities in Guangdong (Grant: 2017WCXTD003), Philosophy and Social Sciences in Guangzhou (Grant: 2018GZGJ194), Yangcheng young scholars' Foundation (Grant: 17QNXR12), Social Sciences Planning Project of the Panyu Polytechnic (Grant: 2016SK007).",,9,2,2,8,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Conventional gradient-based approaches for target recognition require lot of data to be trained on and require exhaustive training with high computational expense. Hence, when a new condition or untrained data is encountered, such systems inadequately misconfigure newly learned feature sets in the trained model. This misconfigures the structure of re-learned features and is then carried out in subsequent recognition stages. Thus, a development in this scenario with low training time will allow us to fend of this disadvantage. This study presents a new automatic target recognition framework that gives the enhanced performance of target-recognition system when several imaging sensors are connected with one another. This is in contrast with traditional automatic target recognition frameworks, which utilizes one-on-one computational model over synthetic-aperture radar image-processing systems. The work comprises of a learning-based classifications strategy when dealing with sharing of learned parameters over the network to discern critical changes in target-recognition performance by utilizing a novel one-shot learning-based reconfigurable learning network for image processing platform.

The trajectory planning strategies of Cartesian space and angular displacement, angular velocity and angular acceleration of three joints in high-speed handling are studied. Firstly, the critical trajectory points starting point and end point, and points for obstacle avoidance height are set up, and then according to the inverse kinematics model of the robot, a point-to-point door type moving trajectory is established, and the mapping relationship between the motion characteristics of the operating space and the motion characteristics of the joint space is established by using the 4-3-4 degree polynomial motion law in the operating space. However, aiming at the higher energy consumption of 4-3-4 degree polynomial interpolation caused by longer the trajectory, and difficult control of obstacle avoidance height, one key point is added. Thereby, the motion rules are interpolated by 4-3-3-4 degree polynomial interpolation, and the mapping relationship between the motion characteristics of the operating space and the motion characteristics of the joint space is established. Two trajectory planning methods are simultaneously simulated under the same keys points and the same trajectory time range. The motion characteristics of the joint rotation angle of the parallel robot between polynomial interpolations are respectively compared. The results show that the trajectory planning method based on 4-3-3-4 degree polynomial interpolation in joint space has obvious advantages in improving the running state of the delta parallel robot and reducing the energy consumption of the system.","[Liu, Cheng; Cao, Guohua] Changchun Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Liu, Cheng; Qu, Yongyin] Beihua Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Jilin, Jilin, Peoples R China","Cao, GH (corresponding author), Changchun Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",bhdqxy@163.com,,,Jilin Provincial Development and Reform Commission [2018C035-1]; Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Talents Team Project [20190101018JH]; Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Department [20160101276JC],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Jilin Provincial Development and Reform Commission (Grant: 2018C035-1), Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Talents & Team Project (Grant: 20190101018JH), and Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Department (Grant: 20160101276JC).",,10,0,0,2,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

It is very important and necessary to identify and avoid such illegal activities without harming anyone in the society. In recent decades, social networks are becoming a popular research area for most researchers. Many authors are doing research on social network datasets and proposing various anomaly detection mechanisms to identify anomalous activities in both static and dynamic growing social networks. Various anomaly detection techniques are proposed by the authors to investigate malicious activities in social networks. In general, the process of identifying anomaly activities of the users in the given dataset is called anomaly detection. The anomaly detection in social networks is the process of investigating whether the users of the given social networks are involved in illegal activities or not. In this work, we proposed a most elegant approach to identify the anomalous or outlier users in the given social network. The proposed approach is considering the users participated in multiple communities of social networks. The designed algorithms are implemented and tested in a big data environment three node cluster using open source Hadoop ecosystem tools. Algorithm1 is used to investigate the nodes/users who participated in multiple communities of the given social network's dataset.

Refactoring is an operation used to improve the structure of an existing system by changing its internal structure without affecting its external behavior. Many studies revealed that refactoring is underused by software development team in industry due to its increased effort and lack of knowledge about existing approaches. Thus, a prioritized correction of antipatterns based on relevance of classes, analyzed development history, risk to refactor, minimized code changes, and maintainers context and preferences is needed for good refactoring recommendations. We propose an approach based on filtered relevant classes with generic linkage-based clustering and adapted nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III to find good refactoring recommendations, which maximize the software quality and reduce the refactoring effort. Our approach uses our own node centrality-based sub-graph isomorphism algorithm to dynamically understand the system with good accuracy prior to optimization. Our approach is evaluated on six open-source systems and the results have shown the effectiveness of our approach compared to the other existing ones.","[Sreeji, K.

At the beginning of the self-intellectual test, language proficiency has always been one of the key test subjects, and most of the intelligence tests also need to be tested by language and writing skills. Testing of English language proficiency is inseparable from the real language environment, but testing in a real environment is time-consuming and laborious. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a test method for rapid evaluation of English networks considering non-metric multidimensional scaling. This study aims to improve the platform test system of the current English network test by analyzing the algorithm characteristics of non-metric multidimensional scale and to optimize the existing English network fast test. At the same time, in order to test the applicability of the English network evaluation project under the algorithm characteristics of the non-metric multidimensional scale, some college students were selected for the test. The results of comparative analysis show that the rapid evaluation of English network based on non-metric multidimensional scale has good reliability and validity, which can effectively distinguish the merits of the assessors, and also can well test the students' level.","[Su, Zheqian; Liu, Miao] Changchun Univ Chinese Med, Foreign Language Dept, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Song, Bailin; Jiang, Man] Changchun Univ Chinese Med, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China","Jiang, M (corresponding author), Changchun Univ Chinese Med, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",1463664429@qq.com,,,"National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of People's Republic of China Great Learning, Great Investigation and Great Implementation in TCM Higher Education: Research on the Theory and Practice of the Teaching Reform of New Teacher Inherit [GZ-10]; Scientific Research Project of Jilin Vocational and Technical Education Institute in 2018: Study on New Teacher Inheritance Model in Jilin Higher Vocational Colleges of Traditional Chinese Medicine [2018XHZ024]","The authors acknowledge National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of People's Republic of China Great Learning, Great Investigation and Great Implementation in TCM Higher Education: Research on the Theory and Practice of the Teaching Reform of New Teacher Inheritance Model in Universities of Chinese Medicine (Grant: GZ-10); Scientific Research Project of Jilin Vocational and Technical Education Institute in 2018: Study on New Teacher Inheritance Model in Jilin Higher Vocational Colleges of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Grant: 2018XHZ024); and Construction Project of Ideological and Political Demonstration Course of Changchun University of Chinese Medicine in 2018.",,17,0,0,3,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In a cognitive network, the secondary transmitter is allowed to access the primary network spectrum when the interference to the primary network is below certain power threshold. While transmitting, the secondary user should cause minimal interference to primary user. So it is inevitable to use a transmit beamformer at the secondary user to focus the beam to desired receiver. A distributed iterative algorithm is formulated through non-cooperative game approach for optimizing the beamforming along with optimum power allocation by maximizing signal to interference ratio of secondary users. This is achieved by deriving an optimal pricing policy for each secondary user, which adapts to the strategies offered by rest of the users, which eventually converges the game into Nash equilibrium. Non-cooperative optimization of transmit power leads to maximization of signal to interference ratio. Subsequently, channel capacity maximization is achieved through water filling algorithm. Through simulations, the effectiveness of the game theory based algorithm is validated and impact of beamforming on signal to interference ratio and system capacity is discussed. The paper is constructed to help graduate students and research scholars easily understand the concept and application of game theory.","[Bindu, E.] GGS Indraprastha Univ, Amity Sch Engn & Technol, Delhi, India; [Reddy, B.

However, in courses related to digital communications or signal processing usually these simulations cannot be easily applied to real data or in real scenarios. This limitation does not allow the students to verify that the learned theoretical hypotheses are valid in practice. Nowadays, software defined radio platforms have been proposed to validate theoretical telecommunications concepts in real situations. Therefore, by combining a software defined radio and simulation tools, students can implement the learned notions over real data in real scenarios. This allows students to work under real applications in order to learn by experience and to see that the theoretical concepts are valid in the real world. This paper presents a project involving real-time decoding of automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) signals, implemented by using a universal software radio peripheral software defined radio and MATLAB (R). The universal software radio peripheral allows to receive real automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast signals sent by the aircraft. Then, by using MATLAB (R) tools, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast baseband signals are decoded. The students are guided through a manual to demodulate the real automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast signals and display in a map the aircraft trajectories. The evaluation is based on a competition between the students, considering execution time of their algorithms, and a final report of the project. This project allows to obtain a game-oriented and novel approach for teaching digital communications and signal processing. The implementation of this project in telecommunications engineering courses motivate the students, allowing them to understand better difficult theoretical concepts, and improve their computer, teamwork, and collaboration skills. The originality of the approach is based on the usage of a prototyping platform, combined with simulation tools, for practical application of telecommunications engineering concepts using real signals.","[Poveda, Hector] Univ Tecnol Panama, Fac Ingn Elect, Panama City, Panama; [Ferre, Guillaume; Tajan, Romain] Bordeaux Inst Technol, ENSEIRB MATMECA, Talence, France","Poveda, H (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Panama, Panama City, Panama.",hector.poveda@utp.ac.pa,,,"National Bureau of Science, Technology and Innovation of Panama through the project RAPIDO-5G [ITE15-021]; Sistema Nacional de Investigacion [SNI 153-2017]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is partially supported by the National Bureau of Science, Technology and Innovation of Panama through the project RAPIDO-5G (ITE15-021) and the Sistema Nacional de Investigacion (SNI 153-2017).",,9,0,0,2,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

Authentication systems such as Biometric crypto systems, Cancellable templates and Bio-hashing provide a solution for addressing these vulnerabilities. But these systems are vulnerable to the unauthorized access resulting from the spoofed fingerprint templates by the fraudulent users. Hence, it is essential to enhance the features of the existing Biometric fingerprint-based authentication systems. An extensive research has been carried out by various researchers on the existing fingerprint authentication system techniques and it is found that none of them are fully capable of eliminating the security vulnerabilities. Fingerprint authentication system technique based on one time fingerprint template provides a solution for this by generating one time template from the fingerprint features. Although this method addresses vulnerability issues to a certain extent, improvements are highly essential particularly in terms of their security and performance. There are several systems based on finger code, where fingerprint features will be converted into finger code using a circular tessellation technique. Although authentication based on this technique improves security, the possibility of compromising the finger code is a huge threat, which needs to be addressed. In this paper, an innovative model is proposed which generates a secure one time finger code during every user authentication. It is generated using finger code obtained from minutiae vectors using a circular tessellation approach, pseudo-random number generators and timestamp, which are generated during every user transaction session. This unique encoding approach makes it extremely difficult for an unauthorized user to decode the generated finger code that is used for a particular authentication session. Thus, the possibility of compromise of original fingerprint can be avoided and thus security of biometric system can be enhanced. The proposed system also provides better performance in terms of its accuracy, processing speed and complexity.","[Harikrishnan, D.; Kumar, N.

It is important to evaluate if scores in tests are reliable, because it shows if the phenomenon under study is measured with precision and low error, which are necessary conditions for a fair assessment. Thus, an analysis is provided about the scores obtained in the 28 continuous assessment tests taken across seven years. Correlation, corrected correlation and Cronbach's alpha are used as psychometric indicators. Results show that, in general, there is a high correlation in the students' scores among the different assessment tests every year, which let us confirm that they have been correctly set out. Additionally, the results are compared among different years, showing that they are similar in the different cohorts. However, variations have also been observed over the years, with tests with poor correlation. Finally, based on the analysed data, a novel method is proposed to early detect problems in the tests' evaluation before the course ends, by correlating their scores in pairs. A low correlation between two tests in the same year, empirically below 0.2, would imply issues in the evaluation.","[Lopez de Vergara, Jorge E.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Commun Technol, Madrid, Spain; [Olmos, Ricardo] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Psychol, Dept Social Psychol & Methodol, Madrid, Spain","de Vergara, JEL (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Escuela Politecn Super, Dept Tecnol Elect & Comunicac, Calle Francisco Tomas Y Valiente 11, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",jorge.lopez_vergara@uam.es,"de Vergara, Jorge E.

Under these situations, if any Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) node wants to send the emergency data to sink/server, then that node may face harsh traffic load conditions in various routes, therefore many times end-to-end delay occurs while sending emergency data. To find the best optimized possible solution for this problem, we proposed an intelligent self-learning and educating algorithm, which uses reinforcement learning technique, shortest path algorithm along with convex-hull algorithm for creation of safe path (green corridor) to send data packets from any node to sink/server in emergency situation on priority basis. This approach is beneficial for engineers (industry/students) to better deal with real-time emergency situations and education purpose. Mainly our proposed learning algorithm selects certain WSN nodes based upon their link quality and higher residual energy to create safe path (green corridor) for emergency situation. The performance of this learning algorithm has been tested in MATLAB and Contiki Cooja simulator under heavy traffic conditions along with various performance parameters like Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) ratio, end-to-end delay, energy consumption and better throughput.

The queue needs to be stabilized for online algorithm Greedy one-slot Game and offline algorithm Bi Layer re Game. The simulations show the relevance of queue stability by finding the average queue delay and average queue size by comparing both the algorithms.","[Arthi, R.; Babu, V. Jagapathi; Aditya, T.

Hence, the objective of this work is to apply existing knowledge for decision making to recommend students during their course registration process in an institution. The situation where more number of experts involves in decision making was influenced by Fuzzy Soft Expert Set (FSES). This work emphasizes the application of FSES for facilitating students' course registration process assuming that the same course is offered by more number of faculty members during a semester. As more number of experts involved in this process and the uncertainty of the available data, using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) along with FSES was considered. A new methodology FSES-TOPSIS was also applied in this work. The proposed method was accurate enough to enable students to rank the faculty members based on their previous performance and to enroll themselves with the faculty members of their interest. The method proposed here can be extended for various problems of similar nature.","[Rani, B. Selva] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Informat Technol & Engn, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Kumar, S.

There are numerous reasons for this difficulty encountered by the students. First off, humans are not innately good at probabilistic intuition. Traditionally, this subject has been introduced in a very abstract manner without emphasis on real-world applications from electrical and computer engineering discipline. In addition, extensive use of interactive simulation and visualization tools, offering an alternative way of developing probabilistic intuition, is usually missing from traditional course offerings. This paper presents a unique pedagogical approach to teaching an introductory probability course offered to electrical and computer engineering juniors. The salient features of the proposed pedagogical approach include more emphasis on real-world electrical and computer engineering problems that show the applications of abstract probabilistic concepts; extensive hands-on and interactive MATLAB (R) simulations of real-world electrical and computer engineering problems that are tightly integrated into the curriculum; highlighting the frequentist approach to build probabilistic intuition using simulations; concrete examples showing how naive probabilistic intuition can be erroneous and how to develop correct probabilistic intuition based on systematically modeling, simulating, and analyzing a problem; and application-based simulations driving the abstract theory rather than the other way around. This pedagogical approach was implemented in a course offered to electrical and computer engineering undergraduates at Purdue University Northwest. The paper presents a concrete example illustrating how the salient features of the proposed pedagogical approach were implemented as part of this course and student data from the courses to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.","[Sheikh, Waseem] Purdue Univ Northwest, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1401 US-421, Westville, IN 46391 USA","Sheikh, W (corresponding author), Purdue Univ Northwest, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1401 US-421, Westville, IN 46391 USA.",waseem@pnw.edu,,,,,,22,1,1,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The complementary strategy incorporates activities usually not taught which are delivered via web-classroom to develop and reinforce the abilities needed to face the industry once they are graduated. A project-based learning strategy is used to reinforce the teaching on sizing, planning, modeling, installations with international standards, the start-up of a photovoltaic system with a monitoring system. Students carry out a financial investment analysis rarely taught, such as the calculation of the payback period, the internal rate of return and the net present value are made to ensure the project viability. Planning-dimensioning usually is taught analyzing the electrical bill to determine the required sizing capacity without considering the building installed capacity. A three-dimensional dimensioning using the geographic location of a possible installation is proposed to provide better information in terms of losses due to shading or obstacles that may affect an installation. Furthermore, it is proposed to perform an analysis of mechanical stresses on the mounting rail system under natural phenomena such as hurricanes. This type of analysis is not usually taught in classes and it is important since an investment can be lost due to natural phenomena as has already occurred in some solar plants. The proposed activities are aimed to develop self-directed learning skills motivating to do research leading to problem-solving and meaningful activities to work autonomously in a natural and real-life situation. This approach allows the teacher and students to ponder deeply about worthy subjects and issues. Five questions were formulated to verify student satisfaction; the 30 surveyed students have a very positive view of this complementary utilized strategy.","[Gonzalez, J.

The team-based learning methodology, which uses the flipped classroom concept, is actively centred on the student. The students study a conceptual material independently before it is covered in the classroom. After that, they spend a considerable amount of time working in groups in the classroom solving problems with conceptual application of the material studied. The last stage of team-based learning is the application of course concepts. However, in the telecommunications field, the high cost of equipment for practical development in educational institutions is a big barrier. Moreover, the equipment used is traditionally dedicated to a single activity. In order to solve this problem and apply all the team-based learning stages in telecommunications engineering teaching, this paper presents a proposal of an adaptation of this methodology using a software-defined radio set using the universal software radio peripheral hardware and the GNU Radio software. This set offers flexible functionalities and low cost. Finally, we show the proposal for each team-based learning stage in the learning process of the amplitude modulator and demodulator - double sideband suppressed carrier relating concepts to practical applications.","[Diniz, P.

Choosing novice friendly sensors can make a substantial difference. In this paper, a framework for selecting sensors for novice use is presented and accessibility obstacles are defined. Six learning barriers in end-user programming are adopted for evaluating obstacles effecting on novice usability. Four properties for evaluating sensors and to overcome the barriers are presented: protocol complexity, connection type and component size, understandable real-life phenomena measured and documentation. Sensor protocol complexity and documentation are identified as key factors affecting implementation challenges.","[Karvinen, Kimmo] Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Automat & Syst Technol, Maarintie 8, Espoo, Finland","Karvinen, K (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Automat & Syst Technol, Maarintie 8, Espoo, Finland.",kimmo.karvinen@iki.fi,,"Karvinen, Kimmo/0000-0003-3946-4163",,,,27,3,3,1,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

However, in the usual teaching process, teachers often teach this knowledge using some simple examples of analysis and calculation but without deep discussions. As a result, students could not have a deep understanding about these concepts or not apply the concepts on actual problems flexibly. Therefore, passive learning habits are formed. The lack of self-exploration awareness and comprehensive ability would result in a poor learning effect. This paper designs a specific application scene of Kirchhoff's circuit laws using a multi-channel resistor network. With this application, students can construct the knowledge system autonomously, find the problems proactively, solve the problems timely, and combine the research-based autonomous learning with extracurricular open mutual learning; so, their active learning ability will be promoted to a large extent. Compared with the past teaching methods, this pedagogical case highlights the following advantages of active learning. Firstly, it highlights the process of guiding students to study the object from a small-scale resistor network to a complex and large-scale multi-channel resistor network. Secondly, it embodies the concrete application of calculus knowledge in various basic courses with the help of perfect mathematical deduction. Thirdly, it exercises students' programming ability by using MATLAB to numerically simulate theoretical results. Finally, this case practices students' hands-on experimental ability by constructing real resistor circuits and verifying the theory and simulation results.

It is a challenge for robotics course professors to get students to clearly understand the basic theoretical concepts for its correct application to solve problems, and to motivate them to achieve the best performance. Previous works proposed the use of 3D models to perform the simulation of industrial robots in class and consequently to reinforce the students' theoretical and practical concepts. However, it has not yet been clearly demonstrated how the use of robots and simulations helps improve students' academic performance. In this paper, the main contribution consists of a formal evaluation in which the comparison between the use of two teaching methods was carried out. In the first teaching method (traditional method), the professor used PowerPoint presentations and oral explanations to teach theoretical concepts and solve exercises (Group A). In the second teaching method, the professor added the use of 3D simulations together with the traditional method to teach theoretical concepts and solve exercises (Group B). Students of both groups performed the same written exam about forward kinematics in order to study and analyse the differences between the methodology used with Group A and the methodology used with Group B. This exam consisted of solving three exercises with different robot complexity levels. The results demonstrate that the performance of the students in group B is significantly better than that of the students in group A. In other words, the use of 3D simulations improves student's academic performance, and provides a teaching tool to enhance the way the professors teach.","[Loreto-Gomez, Gerardo] Inst Tecnol Super Uruapan, Dept Ingn Mecatron, Uruapan, Mexico; [Rodriguez-Arce, Jorge; Montano-Serrano, Victor M.] Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Fac Ingn, Ciudad Univ Cerro de Coatepec S-N, Toluca 50110, Mexico; [Gonzalez-Garcia, Salvador] Tecnol Monterrey, Dept Reg Comp & Mecatron, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias Reg Ctr, Campus Morelia, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico","Rodriguez-Arce, J (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico, Fac Ingn, Ciudad Univ Cerro de Coatepec S-N, Toluca 50110, Mexico.",jrodrigueza@uaemex.mx,"RODRIGUEZ-ARCE, JORGE/AAH-2945-2020","RODRIGUEZ-ARCE, JORGE/0000-0003-0289-7061; Montano-Serrano, Victor Manuel/0000-0002-3228-2773; Loreto, Gerardo/0000-0002-3960-8801",,,,29,11,11,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This important topic is taught in advanced courses of operation and control of power systems, for graduate and undergraduate power engineering students. However, the most used software packages for simulation and analysis of power systems by researchers, students, and educators have put little attention on the state estimation module. Due to this fact, this paper proposes an approach to develop the computational implementation of a practical educational tool for state estimation of electric power systems using the MATLAB optimization toolbox. In this proposal, the formulation of the state estimation problem consists of developing a general digital code to implement an objective function based on the weighted least squares method. While the lsqnonlin function of the MATLAB optimization toolbox solves the formulated state estimation problem. Simplifying both research and educational processes, this tool helps graduate and undergraduate students to improve learning, understanding, and the times of implementation and development of research in state estimation. Simulations of an equivalent model of the Mexican interconnected power system consisting of 190 buses and 46 machines are used to test and validate the proposal performance.","[Zamora-Cardenas, E.

As the implementation of Smart-Grid is imminent, high-skilled professionals are needed to absorb the research, labor, business, logistics, and innovation issues of today and tomorrow. This leads to a transformation of the education role for undergraduate programs which is now, accordingly, urged to build up students' research skills. In this paper, a case study is presented to introduce and asses a new teaching/evaluation methodology intended to build critical thinking, objectivity, and ingenuity among mechanical-electrical undergraduate students during a one-semester course on Smart-Grid. The results show that the proposed technique may improve the aforementioned research skills within the group of students.

Difficulties could be observed during solutions of electrical circuits, which describe the behavior of electric motors in drives, and various electronic appliances are being used in power electronics. This situation is a result of complicated analytical approaches aiming to solve nonlinear ordinary differential equations describing the occurring processes. A typical student has a significant problem in attaining the analytical results. Various methods of linearization nonlinear elements permitting to obtain roughly analytical solutions and simplified solution were applied over the past. Nowadays, coarsely obtained results are not acceptable as a rule. As a result, smart simulation based on PSIM, MATLAB Simulink, and WOLFRAM Mathematica giving excellent opportunity for accurate answers are recommended. All software programs represent undoubtedly important and extremely accurate approaches. However, only numerical results are provided and are not capable of solution's generalization. It seems that in the Power Electronics and Electrical Drives courses, a wide submission could obtain methods of numerical nomograms with dimensionless representation of input-output parameters. Dimensionless approach allows significant diminishing of a number of decisive parameters and simplifies calculation, whereas keeping acceptable precision of results, as well as a possibility of outcome's generalization and representation variables trends in a wide range of input parameters. The likely objects of analysis may be, for example, output characteristics of DC motors fed by controllable and uncontrollable n-phase rectifiers, resistive rectifier losses and motor's efficiency, average and root mean square currents or voltages in electronic circuits, total harmonic distortion, and others. Long-time practice of these approaches approved their usefulness, productivity, and helpfulness.","[Averbukh, M.] Ariel Univ, Dept Elect Elect Engn, Ariel, Israel","Averbukh, M (corresponding author), Ariel Univ, Dept Elect Elect Engn, Ariel, Israel.",mosheav@ariel.ac.il,,,,,,9,6,6,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In this paper, an educational method using diaphragmatic electromyographic (EMGdi) as the de-noising object, which runs on the MATLAB software, has been developed for the convenience of learning and understanding for three-years students in digital signal processing course. This method transforms the analog filter to a digital filter by applying bilinear transformation equations, which allows the students explore the various characteristics of digital filter, such as low pass filter, high pass filter, band pass filter and band stop filter. That means Laplace equation transformed by inductance, capacitance and resistance will be replaced by the z equation, which is used for deriving sequence of difference equations.

Traditional undergraduate textbooks and lab exercises rarely highlight the fact that the performance of capacitive proximity sensors can be quite sensitive to ground loading. This paper presents a simple classroom demonstration for exploring this topic in detail. The capacitive proximity sensor for this demonstration is a hand-held LCR meter connected to a homemade capacitor composed of two strips of aluminum foil. Students explore the operation of this sensor for two different system ground configurations. In the first case the LCR meter is battery powered (floating ground referenced) and in the second case the LCR meter is powered by AC mains supply (earth ground referenced). When a student positions their hand near the foil strips, the battery-powered sensor measures an increase in capacitance. Conversely, the AC-mains-powered sensor measures a decrease in capacitance. The instructor guides students to discover for themselves the reason for this seemingly puzzling difference by modeling parasitic capacitance and ground loading using simple circuit models.","[Scher, Aaron D.] Oregon Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn & Renewable Energy, 27500 SW Pkwy Ave, Wilsonville, OR 97070 USA","Scher, AD (corresponding author), Oregon Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn & Renewable Energy, 27500 SW Pkwy Ave, Wilsonville, OR 97070 USA.",aaron.scher@oit.edu,,"Scher, Aaron/0000-0002-5206-9590",,,,13,8,8,1,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

In electric circuits textbooks, the transformation is found by comparing the two networks and making sure that the resistance between each pair of nodes in one network is the same as the resistance between the same pair of nodes in the other network. The two networks are compared as open-circuit networks. This creates confusion among students because usually the network is part of a larger closedcircuit network. In this paper, an alternative method is proposed. The new method starts from one configuration and finds the corresponding equivalent configuration by deriving currents and voltages, as part of a closed circuit. This method can be adopted in circuit analysis courses to help students develop a deeper understanding of this topic.","[Arabasi, Sameer] German Jordanian Univ, Dept Phys, POB 35247, Amman 11180, Jordan","Arabasi, S (corresponding author), German Jordanian Univ, Dept Phys, POB 35247, Amman 11180, Jordan.",sameer.arabasi@gju.edu.jo,,"Arabasi, Sameer/0000-0001-6645-7802",,,,23,0,0,0,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

This provides undergraduates a useful tool for a better understanding of the harmonic oscillators in order to design and implement accurately this kind of circuits. This tool complements the widely recognized Barkhausen criterion, which is a mathematical condition that must be satisfied by linear feedback oscillators. The analysis based on the dynamical system theory consists of obtaining a state matrix and its eigenvalues from the mathematical model of the oscillator circuits. The eigenvalues are adjusted to get an oscillator system, thus from this way, a set of conditions are derived. These conditions are complementary to those obtained by the Barkhausen criterion.","[Salas-Castro, Pablo; Delgado-Aranda, Finees; Tristan-Hernandez, Edgar; Campos-Canton, Isaac] UASLP, Fac Ciencias, Inst Invest Comunicac Opt, San Luis Potosi, Slp, Mexico; [Martinez-Montejano, Roberto C.] UASLP, Unidad Acad Multidisciplinaria Zona Media, San Luis Potosi, Slp, Mexico; [Murguia, J.

In this paper, the design of an electrodynamic suspension system, in which an aluminium disc suspended above two concentric coils, is considered. The mathematical description is presented and proved that the value of electromagnetic force exerted on the disc is proportional to the inverse square of its height. The system is then simulated with a finite element method software and the effects of varying different system's parameters on the exerted force are studied through simulation results. Analytical calculations and simulation results are validated by being compared with experimental measurements, which show a close agreement.","[Ghayoor, Farzad; Swanson, A.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Elect Elect & Comp Engn, Durban, South Africa","Ghayoor, F (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Howard Coll, Elect Elect & Comp Engn, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa.",ghayoor@ukzn.ac.za,,"Ghayoor, Farzad/0000-0001-5780-6767; Swanson, Andrew/0000-0002-9965-4746",,,,15,4,4,1,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The autonomous audio heater car is a comprehensive project-based analog design experience within a conceive, design, implement, operate framework. The students participate in the overall design process with guided discovery, rather than merely conducting scripted laboratory exercises. Students develop an understanding of the analog design required for each subsystem through weekly individual pre-laboratory and laboratory exercises. The car is guided to a beacon by light and/or audio tone. In transit, the car heats water to a temperature corresponding to the beacon tone and emits a tone corresponding to the instantaneous water temperature. The project culminates with team-based system integration and a competition. The individual work serves to cross-train all of the team members such that they all contribute effectively in the teams. The project motivated students because it provided a framework for laboratory topics, which would typically be considered without the broader context of a system design introduced at the beginning of the course.","[LeBoeuf, Richard L.] Univ Los Andes, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, Santiago, Chile; [Gomez, Jorge T.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Dept Ingn Elect, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile","Gomez, JT (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Dept Ingn Elect, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",jtgomez1@uc.cl,,"LeBoeuf, Richard/0000-0002-0427-6069",,,,41,8,8,1,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0020-7209,2050-4578,,INT J ELEC ENG EDUC,Int.

The measurement system consists of an AC/DC voltmeter and a universal resistive/capacitive high voltage divider. The voltmeter shows measured voltage values based on the scale factor of the voltage divider. The divider ensures a stable capacitance for AC voltage measurements and an additional resistive parallel path for DC voltage measurements. Both the divider and the voltmeter are calibrated in AC and DC modes. All uncertainty components are taken into account to obtain measured values with an acceptable accuracy. The calibration results in traceability to the national standards, which make measurements using the international system of units. The proposed calibration method is useful for the theory and practice of high voltage measurements in education, industrial applications, and electrical metrology studies.","[Mageed, Hala M.

The authors of this paper were prompted to propose changes to the teaching of a final year control unit of a BEng (Hons) Degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering after numerous students had expressed concern about their ability to be successful in this subject. The average exam grade had also been low for several years. Teaching previously had been didactic in nature, based on lectures, predefined laboratory exercises and tutorial sessions. Use of appropriate-based workshop study sessions can lead to higher levels of attainment and development, and student perception is that the experience is informal, engaging but appropriately challenging. A series of workshop sessions were introduced into term two of the unit teaching over a period of several weeks. Students worked individually on learning improvement activities, within cooperative groups in an informal workshop environment. The tasks set to the students were challenging and designed to improve general skills in Control, and students were encouraged to explore further areas that interested them. Results presented in this paper describe an improvement in student engagement, confidence in exam preparation and communication of learning measured by grades since the introduction of the workshop sessions, and improved feedback from students.

The educational tool comprises a graphical user interface in MATLAB. The graphical user interface permits an individual to investigate various parameters involved in the design of the required compensator, which includes percentage overshoot, peak time, and velocity error constant and observe the results dynamically as the parameters change. The approach used in this article for the design of compensators is based on the frequency response analysis. One can obtain various plots including unit step response plot, Bode plot, and root locus plot for uncompensated and compensated systems to have a better understanding of the designed compensator.","[Yadav, Drishti; Patel, R.
