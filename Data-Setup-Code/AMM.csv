Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in 44 ED residents. Urine sample of all individuals were collected at the beginning and end of shifts. Residents' weight, weight changes, and vital signs were measured at the beginning and end of their shifts. Participants were asked about the amount of sleep acquired before and the amount of food and water intake during shifts. Mood and anxiety as well as cognitive behavior were assessed before and after shifts. Results: Urine specific gravity (P<0.001) increased significantly during a shift. Residents' weight (P=0.024) and percentage concentration of urine (P=0.001) were significantly lower after a shift than before a shift. Emergency crowding and percentage of concentration after a shift (P<0.001), emergency crowding and concentration changes (P<0.001), and also the amount of water intake and urine specific gravity after a shift (P=0.01) demonstrated significant negative correlations, while emergency crowding and urine specific gravity before (P<0.001) and after (P<0.001) a shift and also emergency crowding and urine specific gravity changes(P=0.024) demonstrated a significant positive correlations. Conclusions: It seems necessary that residents be much more conscientious about fluid intake during shifts and set aside some time to consume fluids in order to prevent impaired decision-making and decrease possible medical errors.","[Aghili, Seyed Mojtaba; Moghadam, Mohammad Afzali] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Imam Khomeini Hosp, Emergency Dept, Emergency Med, Tehran, Iran; [Shahjooie, Fahime; Vaseie, Mohammad] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Imam Khomeini Hosp, Emergency Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Khazaeipour, Zahra] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Brain & Spinal Cord Injury Res Ctr, Neurosci Inst, Tehran, Iran; [Kia, Maryam] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Ziaeian Hosp, Internal Med Dept, Internal Med, Tehran, Iran","Kia, M (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Ziaeian Hosp, Internal Med Dept, Internal Med, Tehran, Iran.",m-kia@tums.ac.ir,"Shahjooie, Fahime/AAE-7008-2020; kia, maryam/ABE-2631-2020; Aghili, Seyed Mojtaba/J-9092-2017; Vaseie, Mohammad/AAH-2434-2019","Aghili, Seyed Mojtaba/0000-0003-2931-6159; ",,,,25,0,0,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,2.0,,591.0,596,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2s_93,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7SD,WOS:000429274400007,,,,,2022-07-14

Gastric colonization of H. pylori has been established as an etiological factor in chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, atrophic gastritis, gastric adenocarcinoma, and lymphoma. Only a few studies have examined the effect of H. pylori density on clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological findings. The present study aims to investigate the association of H. pylori density with clinical and endoscopic findings as well as histopathological findings that are particularly observed in atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia. Materials and methods: This study included 105 patients that underwent upper gastrointestinal system endoscopy due to various indications. During endoscopy, biopsies were performed from gastric antrum and corpus and the density of H. pylori was assessed with histopathological examination. Patients were categorized as mild, moderate, and severe density groups according to Sydney classification. Furthermore, these groups were compared in terms of endoscopy indications, endoscopic findings, and histopathological features. Results: H. pylori density was mild in 59 (56%) patients, moderate in 23 (22%) patients, and severe in 23 (22%) patients. The most common indication for endoscopy was dyspeptic complaints. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of dyspepsia or other endoscopy indications (p > 0.05). The most frequent endoscopic finding was gastritis. Regarding endoscopic findings, only erosive gastritis was found to be significantly more frequent in the moderate and severe H. pylori density groups compared to the mild density group (p=0.03). There was no difference between the groups regarding atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, or dysplasia (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Our results indicate that H. pylori density does not have significant effect on patients' symptoms or endoscopic and histopathological findings.","[Akin, Mete; Adanir, Haydar] Akdeniz Univ, Sch Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Antalya, Turkey; [Kurtulus, Aziz] Akdeniz Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Antalya, Turkey; [Gelen, Mustafa Tekinalp] Akdeniz Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Antalya, Turkey","Akin, M (corresponding author), Akdeniz Univ Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Antalya, Turkey.",,,,,,,24,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,663.0,668,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_102,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000007,,,,,2022-07-14

Classical cardiovascular risk factors and systemic inflammation may play a role in this process, but the major determinants in elderly women have not yet been established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between classical cardiovascular risk factors, C-reactive protein and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) in elderly non-diabetic women, without overt cardiovascular disease. Methods: Aortic PWV was measured non-invasively using an oscillometric device in 104 elderly women, mean age 69.7 +/- 6.4 years. Laboratory parameters of lipid and glucose metabolism and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were also evaluated. Results: Aortic PWV independently correlated with hsCRP (beta=0.22, p=0.01), systolic blood pressure (beta=0.23, p=0.009), abdominal circumference (beta=0.24, p=0.007) and age (beta=0.18, p=0.03). Aortic PWV was increased in hypertensive compared with normotensive subjects (10.3 +/- 2.3 vs. 9.0 +/- 1.6, p=0.006) and in obese compared to non-obese women (10.7 +/- 1.9 vs. 9.6 +/- 2.2, p=0.01). Conclusion: In elderly non-diabetic women, age, abdominal obesity, systolic blood pressure and hsCRP, are the most important determinants of aortic PWV. Body weight loss, efficient control of blood pressure and decrease in systemic inflammation may reduce arterial stiffness in this high cardiovascular risk population.","[Albu, Adriana; Fodor, Daniela] Iuliu Hatieganu Univ Med & Pharm, Dept Internal Med 2, 2-4 Clinicilor Str, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Bondor, Cosmina I.] Iuliu Hatieganu Univ Med & Pharm, Med Informat & Biostat Dept, Cluj Napoca, Romania","Albu, A (corresponding author), Iuliu Hatieganu Univ Med & Pharm, Dept Internal Med 2, 2-4 Clinicilor Str, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",,"Bondor, Cosmina Ioana/V-8815-2019; albu, adriana/D-4480-2016",,,,,39,2,2,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,625.0,630,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_96,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000001,,,,,2022-07-14

Through the genetic profile we calculated, by an algorithm, the TGS (Total Genetic Score) in both groups; this idea comes from the concept that it's better to personalized workout based on athlete genetic profile. Identifying specifically performance demands (based on the metabolism system used during performance, aerobic or anaerobic) and paying attention to the performance-enhancing genes and their polymorphisms, is important focus it in order to build personalized and successful training for every single athlete. Materials and methods: We considered two groups of professional athletes: 21 basketball players and 21 soccer players both involved in professional championships. For the genetic analysis a saliva sample was taken from athletes, and the polymorphisms were analysed: ACE; ACTN3; CK-MM; PPAR alpha; PPAR gamma C1; NRF2 A/G; NRF2 C/T. Each genotype was scored from 0 to 2 depending on whether they were more related to resistance or power activity. The sum of these scores generates the total TGS for each athlete and was compared both for resistance and power. Results: Our results indicate that professional basketball players have a power-related TGS higher than the resistance-related conversely the football players, that have a resistance-related TGS greater than power-related one. Conclusion: TGS can be a useful tool to identify the genetic predisposition of the athlete starting from the genetic analysis of some PEPs, regardless of the type and number of genes analysed.","[Amato, Alessandra; Messina, Giuseppe; Contro, Valentina; Sacco, Alessia; Proia, Patrizia] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Psicol Pedag & Formaz, Palermo, Italy","Messina, G (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Psicol Pedag & Formaz, Palermo, Italy.",giuseppe.messina17@unipa.it,,"Proia, Patrizia/0000-0002-0326-5560",,,,24,3,3,1,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1857.0,1862,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_287,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400038,,,,,2022-07-14

However, there are no markers that can be used to allow early diagnosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate clinical utility of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) in the diagnosis of GC. Materials and methods: Hundred and fifteen patients with histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of GC and 53 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included in our study at Istanbul University Institute of Oncology. Serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The mean age of the patients was 61 (range: 32-89) years. At the end of the median 11-month follow-up period, 75% (n=86) of the patients died. Serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels were significantly lower in the patient group than those in the control group (p=0.001). The sensitivity and specificity for IGF-1 were found to be 62.61% and 68.52%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity, for IGFBP-3 were found to be 73.91% and 62.96%, respectively. Serum IGFBP-3 levels were significantly higher in younger patients compared to those in older patients (p=0.009). The median survival was 14 +/- 3.3 months (95% Cl= 7.620.4). 3-year survival rate was 25.6% (95% CI=15.4-35.8).

Moreover, it is known that taekwondo shows high risk of injury. The aim of this case study is to evaluate the effects of a specific training protocol on posturographic parameters of a taekwondo elite athlete in order to prevent the risk of injury. Materials and methods: The specific training protocol provided 2 months of general strength conditioning, which included pre-conditioning in the first 2 weeks, physical training to improve explosive strength, balance and postural control and athletic training to improve the combat technique. The experimental design included three assessment times: the pre-test (T-0), the intermediate-test (T-1) and the post-test (T-2). Each test provided the same evaluations: anthropometric measurements, cervical ROM assessment and posturographic evaluation. Results: Stabilometric parameters showed a good balance and postural control both in T-0 and T-2. Baropodometric parameters showed a physiological load pressure distribution between the left and the right foot in T-0 (left foot 54% - right foot 46%) as well as in T-2 (left foot 45% - right foot 55%). The left forefoot-rearfoot ratio pressure showed no differences between T-0 and T-2 (p>0.05); we found an improvement on the right forefoot-rearfoot ratio (p<0.05). Cervical range of motion evaluation showed no significant variations from T-0 to T-2 (p>0.05) on rotation and lateral bending movements; we found an improvement on the extension movement from T-0 to T-2 (p<0.05), while the flexion movement decreased (p>0.05). Conclusion: The presented case study showed that the experimental protocol improved the postural parameters of this taekwondo elite athlete. We believe that other athletes may adopt this protocol in order to improve own sports performance and to prevent injuries.","[Barcellona, Matteo; Battaglia, Giuseppe; Palma, Antonio] Univ Palermo, Sport & Exercise Sci Res Unit, Palermo, Italy; [Giustino, Valerio; Messina, Giuseppe; Iovane, Angelo] Univ Palermo, Posturol & Biomech Lab Res Unit, Palermo, Italy; [Giustino, Valerio; Messina, Giuseppe] Posturalab Italia Res Inst, Palermo, Italy; [Messina, Giuseppe; Battaglia, Giuseppe; Palma, Antonio; Iovane, Angelo] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy; [Battaglia, Giuseppe; Palma, Antonio] CONI Sicilia, Reg Sports Sch, Sicily, Italy; [Fischetti, Francesco] Univ Bari, Dept Basic Med Sci Neurosci & Sense Organs, Bari, Italy","Messina, G (corresponding author), Via Giovanni Pascoli 6, Palermo, Italy.",giuseppe.messina17@unipa.it,"Giustino, Valerio/AAR-6788-2021; Messina, Giuseppe/N-7298-2019; Battaglia, Giuseppe/AAV-3916-2020","Giustino, Valerio/0000-0002-4575-8021; Messina, Giuseppe/0000-0003-2774-4950; Battaglia, Giuseppe/0000-0002-7758-7175; Francesco, Fischetti/0000-0001-8616-5372",,,,25,4,4,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,3.0,,1533.0,1538,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3s_236,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GP7NG,WOS:000441088400013,,,,,2022-07-14

In recent years, amaranth products have been considered an alternative source of gluten-free products due to low content of prolamins. Objective: To evaluate physical growth in children following gluten : free diet after introduction of new amaranth products into their diet, and to study the influence of amaranth products on the adherence to ,gluten-free diet. Materials and methods. The study included 37 children, aged 1-17, with gluten intolerance, who followed gluten free diet six months and more. Their physical development was assessed according to WHO criteria, and their parents reported adherence to gluten-free diet using a specially designed questionnaire. The patients were examined before and after amaranth product introduction into their diets. Results: The research demonstrated that 73% of patients (n=27) strictly followed ,gluten-free diet. 18.9% of children violated the diet rarely, 8.1% frequently violated the diet for a long time. Pathologically low height was diagnosed in 21.5% of children; 5.4% were tall, 59.5% of children were of medium height, 8.1% of children were shorter than medium, 5.4% were higher than medium. Lower body mass was diagnosed in 37.8% of patients, excess body mass was observed in 8.1%; 54.1% of patients had regular (normal?) body mass value. 100% of families included in the study became interested in the option to expand the diet of a child with gluten free products made from amaranth. Regular amaranth product consumption resulted in the increased number of children following strict gluten : free diet (up to 83.8%) and improved physical growth parameters. Conclusion: Amaranth products consumption facilitated adherence to gluten free diet, improved nutrition quality, reduced psycho-emotional over strain in children due to the opportunity to vary their diet by new gluten free amaranth products.","[Bavykina, Irina A.; Zvyagin, Alexandr A.] Voronezh State Med Univ, Voronezh, Russia; [Miroshnichenko, Lidiya A.] OOO Russkaya Oliva, Voronezh, Russia; [Burkovsky, Victor L.] Voronezh State Tech Univ, Voronezh, Russia","Bavykina, IA (corresponding author), 10 Studencheskaya St, Voronezh 394036, Russia.",i-bavikina@yandex.ru,,,Russian Federation [MK-114.2017.7],The study was carried out with the financial support of the grant of the President of the Russian Federation for young Russian scientists - candidates of sciences No. MK-114.2017.7.,,26,0,0,0,9,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,2001.0,2006,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_312,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400063,,,,,2022-07-14

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of FMS in the patients with CKD. Material and methods: A total of 289 (119 predialysis (PD), 85 hemodialysis (HD), 85 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)) patients were included. Diagnosis of FMS was based on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 FMS criteria. Results: Mean age was 52 +/- 16 years (range 18-89 years). One-hundred-sixty-four (56.7%) of them were male. A total of 46 patients (10 male/36 female) (15.9%) were diagnosed FMS. The prevalence of FMS was 28.8% in females and 6.1% in males. Compared to males, females had a significantly higher rate of FMS (p<0.001). The prevalence of FMS was 19.3% in PD group, 17.6% in the CAPD group, and 9.4% in the HD group. Although the frequency of FMS was lower in HD group compared to both the PD and the CAPD groups, the differences were not statistically significant (for HD vs PD, p=0.052; for HD vs CAPD, p=0.113). In PD group, hemoglobin (Hb) levels were significantly higher in patients with FMS than without FMS. Parathormone (PTH) levels were significantly lower in CAPD patients with FMS than without FMS. Although the prevalence of FMS was increased in PD and CAPD patients, this increase did not reach statistical significance. FMS was markedly more prevalent in female patients. While the Hb level was lower in the PD patients with FMS, PTH level was lower in the CAPD patients diagnosed with FMS. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that the rate of FMS was higher in PD and CAPD patients compared to HD patients, although our results did not reach statistical significance. Among the entire demographic and laboratory parameters, female gender was found to be significant risk factor for development of FMS. Future multicenter studies which have large sample size are clearly needed to determine other factors related to development of FMS in patients with CKD.","[Berber, Ilhami] Malatya Educ Res Hosp, Dept Hematol, Malatya, Turkey; [Sahin, Idris] Inonu Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Nephrol Div, Malatya, Turkey; [Gorgel, Ahmet] Gozde Acad Hosp, Dept Endocrinol, Malatya, Turkey; [Cagin, Yasir Furkan] Malatya Educ Res Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Malatya, Turkey; [Bag, Harika Gozukara] Inonu Univ, Fac Med, Dept Biostat, Malatya, Turkey; [Berber, Nurcan Kirici] Malatya Educ Res Hosp, Dept Chest Med, Malatya, Turkey","Berber, I (corresponding author), Malatya Educ Res Hosp, TR-44280 Malatya, Turkey.",drilhamiberber@hotmail.com,"Sahin, Idris/AAS-4390-2020; Bag, Harika Gozde Gozukara/ABG-7588-2020; BERBER, Ilhami/ABI-6231-2020; görgel, ahmet/Q-3139-2019; Cagin, Yasir Furkan/ABI-2709-2020","Sahin, Idris/0000-0002-8683-3737; Bag, Harika Gozde Gozukara/0000-0003-1208-4072; BERBER, Ilhami/0000-0003-3312-8476; Cagin, Yasir Furkan/0000-0002-2538-857X",,,,18,2,2,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,337.0,343,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_53,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400007,,,,,2022-07-14

Sampling was performed at week 4, 8 and 12. Levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (GHb), HDL, LDL, fasting blood TG and Insulin (Ins) were measured by ELISA or automatic biochemical analyzer, and Insulin sensitivity (IS) and Insulin resistance (IR) index were calculated. CCR5 expression was detected by Western blot and RT-PCR. Levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-10 and C-reactionprotein in serum were detected by ELISA. Western blot was used to detect the expression levels of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway related proteins. Compared with control group, indexes including body weight, levels of GHb, LDL, TG, Ins and IR, expression levels of CCR5, IL-6, TNF-alpha and C-reaction protein (CRP), and ratios of PI3K/Akt, P-PI3K/ and PmTOR/mTOR were significantly increased (p < 0.05), but IS level, HDL level and expression level of IL-10 were significantly decreased in model group. However, CCR5Ab treatment significantly reduced those changes to different extents at different time points. CCR5Ab can improve diabetes by reducing body's inflammatory response, and the mechanism of function is possible related to PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.","[Bing, Leilei; Yu, Fengyun; Yu, Wenjuan; Xie, Yanrong] Yantai Hosp Tradit Chinese Med, Dept Endocrinol, 39 Xingfu Rd, Yantai 264001, Shandong, Peoples R China","Xie, YR (corresponding author), Yantai Hosp Tradit Chinese Med, Dept Endocrinol, 39 Xingfu Rd, Yantai 264001, Shandong, Peoples R China.",Yanrong_Xie2017@126.com,,,,,,26,1,1,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,669.0,675,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_103,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000008,,,,,2022-07-14

Among all, heart- type fatty acid binding protein (h-FABP) has been largely investigated. Studies performed on HFABP in these patients present marked heterogeneity. However, it can be stated that HFABP is clearly not a reliable marker for AMI diagnosis, neither as a stand-alone test nor in combination with hs-cTn.

The second hydroxylation step may occur at different tissues and cell types, including kidney, lung, prostate, brain, immune cells and placenta. Based on the advancing knowledge of Cytochrome P450 functions, a new conception of Vitamin D metabolism emerged. It implies that, depending on the site where the second hydroxylation step occurs, the active hormone can act as a calcium-phosphorus-homeostasis regulator, or an immune system modulator, or a cell proliferation and differentiation regulator.

The levels of TGF-beta 1 secreted by HSC-T6 cells were detected by ELISA; the expression of T beta-RI and T beta-RII mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR. Results: Compared with the blank control group, medicated serum of Yujin extract could not inhibit secretion of TGF-beta 1 and expression of T beta-R II mRNA, but had a significant inhibitory effect on expression of T beta-RI mRNA (P < 0.01). Compared with the negative control group, rat serum group could significantly increase content of TGF-beta 1, and increased expression of T beta-RI and T beta-RII mRNA.

Materials and methods: The cross-sectional investigation of urban and rural population of the Karaganda region was carried out. A total of 1,235 residents of the Karaganda region aged 18 to 65 were examined. In addition to calculating the total cardiovascular risk on the Systemic Coronary Risk Evalution (SCORE) scale, questionnaires, general laboratory tests, the level of TMAO was determined by the high performance liquid chromatography with mass-selective mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Results: There was a strong direct relationship between the level of TMAO and the total CVR in men (r = 0.907, p < 0.001), a moderate direct relationship in women (r = 0.559, p < 0.001). According to the results of the binary logistic regression, the OR for men is 4.348 (95% CI 1.684; 11.227, p < 0.005), the OR for women is 1.624 (95% CI 1.408; 1.837, < 0.001).

Those age 65 and older are in a vulnerable position when discussing sexuality due to their concern over society's perception of them. The objectives of this study were to evaluate older persons' attitudes toward sexuality in people over 65 years old and determine whether associations exist between these attitudes. Material and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of attitudes and knowledge about affective and sexual behaviors among older people who attended two senior centers in Madrid, Spain. Sixty-seven participants from 65 to 95 years old responded. A self-administered questionnaire about sexuality developed by Corominas and colleagues we collected (cronbach's a of 0.85). Results: Participants tended to talk with others about sexuality, and this was especially so for men and those aged 65 to 80 years. Women and men and participants of all ages generally did not consider it indecent for older persons to show interest in sex. Men were less bothered by being naked in front of their partners than women were. Conclusion: Those over age 65 remain interested in sex; women and men think different about their level of comfort at being naked in front of a partner and their desire to receive sexual information; younger participants were more likely to talk about sex than older ones.","[Cabrera Fernandez, Susana; Losa Iglesias, Marta Elena; Corral Liria, Inmaculada; Jimenez Fernandez, Raquel; Rodriguez Vazquez, Rocio; de Bengoa Vallejo, Ricardo Becerro] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fac Ciencias Salud, Avda Atenas S-N, Alcorcon Madrid 28922, Spain","Iglesias, MEL (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fac Ciencias Salud, Avda Atenas S-N, Alcorcon Madrid 28922, Spain.",marta.losa@urjc.es,"Iglesias, Marta E Losa/B-8830-2009; de Bengoa Vallejo, Ricardo Becerro/P-4153-2019","Iglesias, Marta E Losa/0000-0001-7588-2069; ",,,,24,0,0,3,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,1.0,,,,,197.0,202,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_1_32,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AH,WOS:000424878600032,,,,,2022-07-14

This study aimed to present the pathological and histological features, our clinical practice with surgical treatment, and the outcomes of GIST diagnosed in our center. Materials and methods: A retrospective study of 48 consecutive patients with GIST treated at our institution from June 2008 to September 2015 was performed. Information regarding age, gender, tumor location, size, procedure performed, postoperative complications, and long-term follow-up were collected from the patient charts. Immunohistochemistry studies were performed to corroborate the diagnosis. The mitotic count was performed on 50 HPFs (50 consecutive high-power fields), with a wide-field ocular microscope. Results: The most common primary site was stomach in 18 patients, followed by small intestine in 15. Among the study group, four patients presented with recurrent disease either isolated recurrence or metastasis. Surgery was performed in all patients. Three patients had a R2 resection and the rest of the patients had tumor-free margins (R0 resection). In our cohort we had 13 patients who received adjuvant imatinib. A variety of surgical procedures was performed. The tumor size varied from 0.8 to 22 cm. The mean follow-up period was 54.0 +/- 1.4 months. During the follow-up period, four patients had recurrence. One patient had metastasis during the follow-up. Six patients died due to GIST, four patients died due to other disease.

Considering that the ,following molecules will allow an early diagnosis of AKI, we examined neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), interleukin (IL-18), cystatin C (Cys-C), and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) in the urine samples and compared the levels of these molecules with the serum creatinine levels. Material and method: 27 patients who developed AKI and 27 patients who did not develop AKI, were included in the study. AKI and non-AKI groups namely , according to the RIFLE criteria. The urine samples from the patients were collected on the 1st, 3rd, and 7th days to study the levels of NGAL, IL-18, cystatin C, and KIM-1 as the biomarkers. Results: A significant difference was observed between the AKI and the non-AKI groups in terms of the APACHE II scores (p<0.001). A moderately negative and significant correlation at the level of p<0.05 was determined between the APACHE II scores and the day of ARE development (p=0.041, r=-0.403). As regards to the biomarker levels, we studied, statistically significant differences were identified in the AKI and non-AKI groups in the IL-18 levels on all of the three days which the tests were performed (p=0.042, p=0.008, p<0.0001 respectively). However, Cys-C levels measured on the 1st, 3rd, and 7th days were not statistically significantly different in the AKI or non-AKI groups (p=0.625, p= 0.074, p=0.061 respectively). Conclusion: NGAL can be a valuable biomarker to detect the development of AKI in the early phase in ICU admissions. NGAL and KIM-1 can be consecutively used for the early diagnosis of AKI. IL-18 can be used for the early diagnosis of AKI and it is a valuable biomarker.","[Canakci, Ebru] Ordu Univ, Dept Anesthesiol & Reanimat, Fac Med, Ordu, Turkey; [Karatas, Ahmet] Ordu Univ, Div Nephrol, Dept Internal Med, Fac Med, Ordu, Turkey; [Noyan, Tevfik; Ayhan, Burhanettin Sertac] Ordu Univ, Dept Med Biochem, Fac Med, Ordu, Turkey","Canakci, E (corresponding author), Ordu Univ, Dept Anesthesiol & Reanimat, Fac Med, Training & Res Hosp, Nefs I Bucak St, Ordu, Turkey.",canakciebru@gmail.com,"NOYAN, Tevfik/ABI-5254-2020; Canakci, Ebru/AAO-6761-2020","NOYAN, Tevfik/0000-0002-7733-0177; ",,,,24,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,2023.0,2029,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_316,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400067,,,,,2022-07-14

We aimed to determine the aetiological subtypes of stroke and distribution of the risk factors and share clinical outcomes of patients with ischaemic stroke aged below 50 years. Material and methods: The data of patients aged 50 years or younger, who were hospitalized in the department of neurology at Dumlupinar University Faculty of Medicine with the diagnosis of ischaemic stroke and who were followed up in the outpatient stroke clinic, were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic characteristics of the patients and the risk factors for stroke were recorded (Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart diseases, hyperlipidaemia, smoking and alcohol consumption, oral contraceptive use and regular medication and migraine). The patients were grouped according to the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment classification. Patients were divided into two groups as below 45 years and 45 and older for statistical analysis Results: Of the patients, 37 (50%) were male, and 37 (50%) were female, and the mean age was 41.14 +/- 6.99 (17-49) years. In total patient population, 25 patients (33.8%) had cardioembolic stroke, 16 (21.6%) had stroke due to unknown causes, 14 (18.9%) had stroke due to other reasons, 12 (16.2%) had stroke due to atherosclerosis of large arteries and 7 (9.5%) had stroke due to lacunar infarction. Smoking (n = 37, 50%), cardiac diseases (n = 28, 38%), hyperlipidaemia (n = 24, 32.4%), obesity (n = 18, 24.3%), hypertension (n = 17, 23%) were the most common risk factors. Conclusion: The present study found that the risk factors observed in young stroke patients, particularly in patients aged below 50 years, were not remarkably different than the widely recognized risk factors, and congenital and genetic causes were more common in patients aged below 45 years.","[Cetiner, Mustafa; Kabay, Sibel Canbaz; Ayas, Selahattin; Temel, Ozge] Dumlupinar Univ, Fac Med, Dept Neurol, Eryigit Sokak 24 Ladin Sitesi A Blok K 3,D-13, Kutahya, Turkey; [Aydin, Hasan Emre] Dumlupinar Univ, Fac Med, Dept Neurosurg, Kutahya, Turkey; [Cam, Mustafa] Denizli State Hosp, Dept Neurol, Denizli, Turkey; [Zorlu, Yasar] Izmir Tepecik Educ & Res Hosp, Neurol Clin, Izmir, Turkey","Cetiner, M (corresponding author), Dumlupinar Univ, Fac Med, Dept Neurol, Eryigit Sokak 24 Ladin Sitesi A Blok K 3,D-13, Kutahya, Turkey.",,"ayas, selahattin/O-4160-2015; Aydin, Hasan Emre/AAA-4657-2021; ÇETİNER, MUSTAFA/AAG-6811-2021","Aydin, Hasan Emre/0000-0002-8932-1542; ",,,,34,0,0,3,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,4.0,,,,,1019.0,1025,,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ1AT,WOS:000434986500018,,,,,2022-07-14

Death is commonly observed, since they cause serious toxicity. These effects often cause central nervous system damage . The end result of the use of synthetic cannabinoids is the circulatory and respiratory system as well as the central nervous system. Sudden changes in respiratory rate, rise in heart beat and expansion in blood vessels are significant symptoms. The aim of this study is to reveal changes in Total Antioxidant Level (TAS) and Total Oxidant Level (TOS) parameters in liver, kidney and brain tissues in order to obtain information about the predicted damages caused by synthetic drugs in tissues and organs. In our study, 20 male Wistar albino rats at least 8 weeks old were used. The rats were divided into two groups, experiment and control group, while the difference between the weights of the rats was adjusted to be statistically insignificant (p = 0.231) by two sample t tests. Experimental ,group rats were implemented as infra peritoneal the mixture of 0.5 ml / kg Ethanol, 4.5 ml / kg Dextrose, 5 mg / kg JWH-200. No implementation was applied to the control group. Decapitation was perforated under ,general anesthesia 8 hours after this implementation. TAS and TOS parameters were studied by taking and preparing liver, kidney and brains of both groups. Oxidative stress indexes were determined by measuring from the organs taken from the experimental and control groups with a spectrophotometer. The difference between the two groups was considered statistically insignificant (p > 0.05). Liver TOS level was determined higher in the experimental group in comparison with control ,group. In our study, renal TAS findings were determined lower in the experimental ,group than in the control group. In our study, oxidative stress is formed because of the high levels of antioxidant levels of kidney. It is thought that the use of synthetic cannabinoids in different systems, depending on the dose, can also affect the urinary system and the kidneys at the same time.","[Cetinkaya, Ismail] Mehmet Akif Ersoy Univ, Hlth Sci Inst Lab & Expt Anim, Burdur, Turkey; [Polat, Mumin] Mehmet Akif Ersoy Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Burdur, Turkey","Polat, M (corresponding author), Mehmet Akif Ersoy Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Emergency & Disaster Management, TR-15100 Burdur, Turkey.",mpolat@mehmetakif.edu.tr,,,Mehmet Akif Ersoy University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit [0373-YL-16],This study was supported by Mehmet Akif Ersoy University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit (Project number; 0373-YL-16).,,44,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,2007.0,2011,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_313,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400064,,,,,2022-07-14

Fusidic acid (FA), the use of which has recently come to the agenda again, is thought to form a new alternative treatment for staphylococci infections. The aim of our study is to identify the FA resistance situation at certain centers compared to generally increasing antibiotic resistance, to present epidemiological data on new antibiotherapy methods and to aid in treatment planning. Materials and methods: With this aim we determined and compared the susceptibility of 2018 Staphylococcus aureus and 5242 Coagulase negative Staphylococci strains obtained at 11 centers in different regions of our country against FA, oxacillin, penicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin. Results: The Coagulase negative Staphylococci strains were determined to be more resistant to all antibiotics compared to S. aureus strains. When the means of all centers are examined, FA resistance was found in 7.1% of S. aureus strains and 55.1% of Coagulase negative Staphylococci strains. Of all antibiotics for both S. aureus and Coagulase negative Staphylococci strains the antibiotic that strains were most susceptible to was trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, while the antibiotic that most were resistant to was penicillin. Conclusion: In light of these findings, with high susceptibility of 92.9% for S. aureus strains to FA, it appears to be a good alternative treatment choice for S. aureus infections. Due to high resistance rates of methicillin-resistant Coagulase negative Staphylococci sourced infections, before treatment it is necessary to perform an antibiotic susceptibility test. We believe that broader scale and more comprehensive studies will provide guidance in planning treatment.","[Cetinkol, Yeliz; Keremcalgin, M.] Ordu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Ordu, Turkey; [Aladal, Murat] Agri State Hosp, Dept Med Microbiol, Agri, Turkey; [Unal, Nevzat; Ahmetbayik, Seyit] Adana Numune Training & Res Hosp, Dept Med Microbiol, Adana, Turkey; [Bayramoglu, Gulcin] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Trabzon, Turkey; [Dogan, Metin] Necmeddin Erbakan Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Konya, Turkey; [Durmaz, Suleyman] Konya Numune Training & Res Hosp, Dept Med Microbiol, Konya, Turkey; [Gunes, Hayati] Namik Kemal Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Tekirdag, Turkey; [Ozlemkalayci, Hacer; Yula, Erkan] Ordu State Hosp, Dept Med Microbiol, Ordu, Turkey; [Cetinonarer, Pelin] Katip Celebi Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Izmir, Turkey; [Mengeloglu, Zafer] Izzet Baysal Training & Res Hosp, Dept Med Microbiol, Bolu, Turkey; [Milletli, Fikriye] Ahi Evran Univ, Training & Res Hosp, Dept Med Microbiol, Kirsehir, Turkey; [Ozdemir, Metin] Gazi State Hosp, Dept Med Microbiol, Samsun, Turkey; [Yanik, Keramettin] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Samsun, Turkey","Cetinkol, Y (corresponding author), Ordu Univ, Training & Res Hosp, Bucak Mah Nefsi Bucak Cad, Ordu, Turkey.",,"ÇETİNKOL, YELİZ/AGX-6363-2022; Bayramoglu, Gulcin/AAR-2120-2020; Dogan, Metin/A-5751-2019","Dogan, Metin/0000-0003-3471-4768; Unal, Nevzat/0000-0001-5121-3100",,,,16,1,1,0,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,397.0,402,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_63,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400017,,,,,2022-07-14

At the same time, the following parts of two groups were measured: angle of lumbar spondylolisthesis, spondylolisthesis rate, spondylolisthesis distance to analyze comparatively the above patients with these indicators. The results show that the angle of lumbar lordosis, thoracic posterior lobe and spondylolysis angle of the group of patients was significantly higher than that of degeneration group, meeting P < 0.05, which has statistical significance. The patients in the degeneration group were superior to spondylolysis group in vertical distance of sagittal axial. The comparison between two groups of patients does not exist statistical significance in following aspects: namely morphological parameters of the pelvis, pelvic tilt angle, sacral inclination angle and lumbar spondylolisthesis rate and so forth. Therefore, we can draw the conclusion that the isthmic lumbar spondylolisthesis of badminton players is similar to degenerative spondylolisthesis in pelvic morphology, but the former has larger thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis and spondylolisthesis angle than the latter.","[Chen, Sheng] Chengdu Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Chengdu 610106, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Rui] Sichuan Univ, Coll Literature & Journalism, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China","Chen, S (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ, Phys Educ 1Sch, Chengdu 610106, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",787345913@qq.com,,,,,,18,0,0,0,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,3.0,,1583.0,1587,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3s_246,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GP7NG,WOS:000441088400022,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: Sixty male SPF SD rats were given adaptive feeding for one week and were randomly divided into a blank control group, a model group, Zusanli and Zhongwan (ZZ) group, Zusanli and Neiguan group (ZN), as well as Zusanli and non-meridian acupoint (ZNA) group, with 12 rats in each group. Except for the blank group, the other 48 rats were used to establish a DGP model by using streptozotocin. Acupuncture therapy was performed from the end of the tenth week for an additional four weeks. Then the rats were sacrificed and the sera and gastric fundus tissues were collected. Serum ghrelin content was assayed with ELISA kits. The expression of ghrelin positive cells in the gastric fundus tissue was determined by immunohistochemistry, while the expression of ghrelin and GHSR mRNA in the gastric fundus tissue was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Compared with the control group, the feed intake and the expression of ghrelin and GHSR mRNA in the gastric fundus tissue in the model group was significantly increased, while small intestinal propulsion rate, serum ghrelin content, and the gray value of the gastric fundus were significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Compared with the model group, the expression of ghrelin and GHSR mRNA in the gastric fundus tissue, small intestinal propulsion rate, serum ghrelin content, and gray value of the gastric fundus were significantly increased (p < 0.05). Feed intake was significantly higher in the ZN and the ZNA groups (p < 0.05), and the expressions of ghrelin and GHSR mRNA in the gastric fundus tissue were significantly increased (p < 0.05) but the serum ghrelin content in ZN group was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that improvement of gastrointestinal motility in DGP by acupuncture therapy is associated with serum ghrelin content and GHSR expression in the gastric fundus. They also indicate that the effect of treatment with local acupoints compatibility is better than that of distal acupoints compatibility, and that acupoint selection according to location or outcome is a key factor that influences acupoints compatibility.","[Chen, Tao] Gansu Prov Hosp Rehabil Ctr, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhanhua] Lanzhou Petrochem Gen Hosp, Dept Lab, Lanzhou 730060, Gansu, Peoples R China","Wang, ZH (corresponding author), Lanzhou Petrochem Gen Hosp, Dept Lab, Lanzhou 730060, Gansu, Peoples R China.",ij0738@163.com,,,,,,26,0,0,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,893.0,900,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_137,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000041,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: A CT scan of the abdomen supported the evidence of renal hemorrhage. In view of the markedly raised pancreatic enzymes and CT findings, the acute pancreatitis was also diagnosed. Results: Multi-factors lead to the development of the disease. The factors such as anticoagulation used during HD, uraemia-associated functional platelet abnormalities, immunosuppression (corticosteroid), intimal arterial fibrosis and hypertension often combine to cause SRH. Other possibilities can be considered for the mechanism of AP: SHPT, gastrointestinal hormones and immunological condition. Conclusion: SRH and AP are both potentially life threatening condition in patients with end-stage renal disease(ESRD).

We first demonstrated that treatment with 10 to 10(4) nM aldosterone leads to a significant increase in IL-8 secretion and mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner. Pretreatment of cells with the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist spironolactone and anti-Toll-like receptor 4 (anti-TLR4) antibody inhibited IL-8 production in aldosterone-treated cultures.

If treated improperly, athletes' body health and sports career will be adversely affected. In order to provide more scientific and intuitive guidance basis for clinical treatment of shoulder joint injury, an in-depth analysis on clinical effect of surface electromyography and muscle testing technology for treatment of shoulder joint injury was carried out. In this study, 1,200 shoulder joint injury patients were selected as observation group research objects; 500 athletes without sports injury were additionally selected as control group research objects. Both groups received surface electromyography and isokinetic muscle testing, with test results of the two groups compared. The results of surface electromyography and isokinetic muscle testing showed significant differences between observation group and control group patients' shoulder joint in angular velocity, abduction supraspinatus, infraspinatus IEMG. Difference between the groups P <0.05, with significant statistical significance. It can thus be concluded that after athletes have shoulder joint injury, muscles, joints of associated parts will undergo obvious changes. With surface electromyography and isokinetic muscle testing technology, full and accurate assessment of changed muscle function, status can be made, thereby providing valuable basis for treatment of shoulder joint injury.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether enhanced HbF production is associated with erythropoietin (EPO) level and total oxygen concentration (ctO(2)) in patients with diabetes. Methods: Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), HbF, EPO, oxygen saturation (sO(2)), and renal parameters were measured in type 2 diabetic patients. The ctO(2) was calculated using sO(2), partial pressure of oxygen, and Hb sub-fractions. Results: Serum EPO concentration was significantly higher in patients with HbF > 1.0% than in those with HbF <= 1.0% (13.9 IU/L versus 8.5 IU/L, p < 0.001). Median ctO(2) level was significantly lower in the elevated HbF group than in the non-elevated HbF group (12.0 vol% versus 16.5 vol%, p < 0.001). The HbF concentration was closely associated with EPO and ctO(2) levels after adjusting for potential confounders [r = 0.306 and r = -0.257, respectively, p < 0.001]. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, a decreased ctO(2) level (< 11.2 vol%) was significantly associated with enhanced HbF production [odds ratio, 1.47 (95% CI, 1.023.07), p = 0.009]. In a receiver operating characteristic curve, the diagnostic ability of EPO and ctO(2) to identify HbF > 1.0% in diabetics was superior to that of HbA1c [0.743 (95% CI, 0.636-0.850) and 0.677 (95% CI, 0.569-0.784) versus 0.570 (95% CI, 0.4460.694); respectively, p < 0.001].

Fascioliasis is a parasite disease that might have changes in liver parenchyma and in bile ducts. Many inflammatory reactions occur during the settlement of larvae and mature parasites into the liver. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has become a prominent marker of underlying inflammation. The objective of the present study is to investigate the relationship between the hematological parameters in patients with fascioliasis. Materials and methods: The diagnosis of fascioliasis was based on patient history, clinical and laboratory findings, radiological imaging (ultrasound), stool examination and IgG antibody titer determination by ELISA. Clinical and laboratory data were collected for 56 patients with fascioliasis, and diagnosed with serological and radiological imaging. 56 healthy volunteers were selected for the control group. Stool and blood samples were collected from patients with fascioliasis for serologic, biochemical, hematologic tests and ova examination. Total leukocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil and lymphocyte counts were recorded and NLR was calculated. ELISA antibody cut off titer value of patients with fascioliasis was 10> positive. Results: We compared neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, eosinophil/lymphocyte ratio, the relation of eosinophilia and IgG antibody titers between two groups (patient and control groups). There was no statistically significant difference between patients and healthy controls neither based on age and gender nor NLR. According to these findings, NLR can not be considered as a diagnostic marker in fascioliasis. Conclusion: As a result, it was determined that NLR is not a crucial indicator of inflammation in parasitic fascioliasis. Extensive studies are need to be done to clarify the correlation between NLR and progression of other parasitic diseases.","[Cicek, Mutalip] Ahi Evran Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Kirsehir, Turkey; [Deveci, Ozcan] Elazig Med Pk Hosp, Dept Clin Microbiol & Infect Dis, Elazig, Turkey; [Cengiz, ZeynepTas] Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Parasitol, Van, Turkey; [Bilden, Alican; Bilik, Ozge Alkan] Dicle Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Diyarbakir, Turkey","Deveci, O (corresponding author), Elazig Med Pk Hosp, Dept Clin Microbiol & Infect Dis, Elazig, Turkey.",,,,,,,20,0,0,1,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,4.0,,,,,955.0,958,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4_145,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ1AT,WOS:000434986500008,,,,,2022-07-14

ERCP was performed for removing the stent, however the patient had developed severe peritonitis 36 hours after the procedure. An urgent operation performed and a perforation around the Trietz ligament was detected. Case 3: A 77 year-old woman was referred for choledocholithiasis. During ERCP there were large stones in biliary system that can not be removed endoscopically, so a temporary plastic biliary stem was inserted. Despite the stent placement, clinical condition of the patients has not improved and septic condition was developed due to extensive peritonitis. Conclusion: Although the clinical presentaions are similar to each other, it seems that the mortality rate of unusual perforations are quite higher than that of juxtapapillary perforations. The delay of surgical treatment in unusual perforations results in doubling the mortality rate. So every effort should be delineated to determine the perforation site and surgical treatment should be considered preferentially especially in first 24 hour.","[Cilekar, Murat; Akici, Murat; Yilmaz, Sezgin] Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Gen Surg Dept, Fac Med, TR-03020 Afyon, Turkey; [Arslan, Ramazan Serdar] Banaz State Hosp, Gen Surg Dept, TR-64520 Banaz, Usak, Turkey","Cilekar, M (corresponding author), Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Gen Surg Dept, Fac Med, TR-03020 Afyon, Turkey.",drmsurgeryx@hotmail.com,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,2013.0,2016,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_314,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400065,,,,,2022-07-14

The mortality rate is 40% within 5 years in patients with major amputation due to diabetic foot wounds (DFW). Therefore, a nonsurgical but effective treatment method is needed for the treatment of DFW. In this study, we aimed to compare the results of intralesional epidermal growth factor (EGF) injection and negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for the treatment of DFW. Materials and methods: The medical records of patients who were treated for DFW with EGF or NPWT between February 2017 and December 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients demographics, wound characteristics, allergic reactions and treatment responses were evaluated. Results: Amongst 42 patients, 20 patients were treated with the injection of EGF and 22 patients treated with NPWT. The duration of diabetes was higher in EGF group when compared to the NPWT group without a statistically significance (EGF: 20,7 years, NPWT: 16,9 years). According to the Wagner-Meggitt classification, the grade of the wounds was comparable in both groups. A complete response were obtained in 17 (85%) patients and 50% wound closure was achieved in the other patients in EGF group. In the NPWT group complete response rate was 45.4%. No major amputation was performed in any patient. In NPWT group, 13 (59%) of wouds were closed with split-thickness skin graft, only 3 patients (15%) of the EGF group were required a skin graft. The main advers affect of the EGF injection was an elevated fasting blood glucose level. In both groups, A decreased HbA1c levels were found after the wound treatment. Conclusion: Both administration of intralesional EGF and NPWT are safe, effective and non-surgical methods for the treatment of DFW. NPWT is seems to be a more effective treatment modality for infected wounds.","[Colak, Bayram; Kirazli, Halil; Ece, Ilhan; Yormaz, Serdar; Sahin, Mustafa] Selcuk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, Konya, Turkey","Colak, B (corresponding author), Selcuk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, Konya, Turkey.",bayro.99@gmail.com,"Ece, ilhan/AAR-9923-2020; Sahin, Mustafa/AAH-3394-2019","Ece, ilhan/0000-0002-6966-7036; Sahin, Mustafa/0000-0002-4718-0083",,,,47,0,0,2,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1245.0,1252,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_191,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700013,,,,,2022-07-14

Children who have a headache, generally present to pediatric, and pediatric neurology outpatient clinics with an inability to maintain social activities and often are absent from school. This study aimed to determine the etiology and trigger factors of headaches and the sociodemographic characteristics of children with headaches. Materials and methods: The sample of 500 pediatric patients who presented with headaches to the pediatric neurology outpatient clinic of Tepecik Training and Research Hospital between 2004 and 2009, and who had complete ,file records, were retrospectively evaluated in this study. The headache classification of patients was performed in accordance with the criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-11, 2004). Results: The sample consisted of 500 patients in total including 299 females (59.8%) and 202 males (40.2%) between the ages of 2 and 14. The mean age of the patients recruited for the study was 11 +/- 2.7. The most common cause of headache in children was migraine (43%),followed by tension-type headache and sinusitis as the most common causes. The most common trigger factor in children was stress, at 66.4%. Other common trigger factors included hunger and sleep deprivation. Conclusion: A headache in children is a complaint that affects the quality of life both in children and parents, and raises concern that there might be a worse underlying condition. Therefore, imaging should be used in selected patients along with a detailed history and physical examination. Hence, it is important to use the updated ICHD criteria as a guide in clinical practices.","[Dag, Nevin Cetin; Dizdarer, Gulsen] Minist Hlth, Tepecik Training & Res Hosp, Dept Pediat, Izmir, Turkey; [Dag, Huseyin] Minist Hlth, Istanbul Okmeydani Training & Res Hosp, Dept Pediat, Istanbul, Turkey","Dag, H (corresponding author), Minist Hlth, Istanbul Okmeydani Training & Res Hosp, Dept Pediat, Istanbul, Turkey.",huseyindag2003@gmail.com,,,,,,33,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,4.0,,2179.0,2184,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4s_333,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,HA4LD,WOS:000450232900013,,,,,2022-07-14

We aimed to investigate the effects of antioxidant allopurinol (AP) and the potential mechanisms leading amelioration upon acetic acid induced colitis. Materials and methods: Twenty-eight rats were divided in four groups. Control rats received 1 mL of NaCl (0.9%). In the AA group rats received 1 mL of 5% (v/v) acetic acid. The rats in the AAAP group received 1 mL of 5% (v/v) acetic acid. Additionally these rats received 100 mg/kg AP. AP group rats received only 100 mg/kg AP. Histopathological, biochemical and western blot analysis were done. Results: In the AA group, colonic injury scores, malondialdehyde (MDA), NF-kappa B p65, TNF alpha, COX2, AP-1 and IL-6 levels were significantly higher than in the control group (P<0.05). In the AAAP treatment group the colonic injury scores, MDA, NF-kappa B p65, TNFa, COX2, AP-1 and IL-6 levels significantly decreased when compared to the AA treated rats (P<0.05). The expression of HO-1 in the AAAP group significantly increased when compared to the AA treated rats (P<0.05). Conclusion: Intra colonic acetic acid instillation causes severe intestinal injury accompanied to increased oxidative stress. AP treatment ameliorates this injury by overcoming oxidative stress and regulating cellular redox balance in favor of antioxidant defense mechanisms probably via manipulation of redox sensitive transcription factors.","[Demirel, Ulvi; Yalniz, Mehmet; Tunc, Nurettin; Sahin, Abdurrahman; Bahcecioglu, Ibrahim Halil] Firat Univ, Sch Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Elazig, Turkey; [Orhan, Cemal; Sahin, Kazim] Firat Univ, Dept Anim Nutr, Fac Vet Sci, Elazig, Turkey; [Tuzcu, Mehmet] Firat Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Elazig, Turkey; [Ozercan, Ibrahim Hanifi] Firat Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Elazig, Turkey","Demirel, U (corresponding author), Univ Mah,Yunus Emre Blv 20, TR-23200 Elazig, Turkey.",,"Orhan, Cemal/Q-2086-2015; tunc, Nurettin/G-3282-2018; Sahin, Abdurrahman/C-1200-2019; ÖZERCAN, ibrahim Hanifi/W-7883-2018; Yalnız, Mehmet/G-6767-2015; Sahin, Kazim/D-5625-2009; Tuzcu, Mehmet/H-2953-2018","Orhan, Cemal/0000-0003-4138-7689; tunc, Nurettin/0000-0002-9723-4510; Sahin, Abdurrahman/0000-0001-5477-9492; ÖZERCAN, ibrahim Hanifi/0000-0002-8781-8838; Yalnız, Mehmet/0000-0001-7776-4154; Sahin, Kazim/0000-0001-9542-5244; Tuzcu, Mehmet/0000-0002-1329-3143",,,,30,1,1,0,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,1.0,,,,,119.0,126,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_1_20,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AH,WOS:000424878600020,,,,,2022-07-14

Common symptoms of degenerative wrist arthritis are pain and stiffness. Though, there is no cure for arthritis at the present time, there have been many treatment options to help recover pain and stiffness. The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of posterior interosseous nerve denervation and proximal row carpectomy to the improvement of pain and functional condition of patients who developed degenerative arthritis of the wrist. Materials and methods: The differences in the preoperative and postoperative 1st month, 6th month and 1st year VAS (Visual analogue scale) values of 9 patients, who underwent the same surgical procedure between January 2014 and June 2016, were recorded. The preoperative and postoperative 3rd-month and the 1st-year Quick DASH (The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Score) scores were determined and the mean value was obtained. The range of the wrist motion was evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: The postoperative follow-up period was 22 (15-42) months. One (11%) patient developed postoperative pin site infection, which regressed with local dressing and oral antibiotherapy. One (11%) patient developed complex regional pain syndrome. A significant decrease was obtained in the mean postoperative VAS scores compared to the preoperative VAS scores (p < 0.01). The difference was 3.67. A significant improvement was obtained between the mean values of preoperative and postoperative Quick DASH scores (p < 0,01). The difference in Quick DASH score was 46%. Conclusion: We concluded that proximal row carpectomy along with posterior interosseous nerve neurectomy is movement-preserving surgery and that it is effective for pain control in patients with degenerative arthritis of the wrist and also advanced Kienbock's disease.","[Demiroglu, Murat] Medeniyet Univ Gortepe EAH, Orthopaed, Istanbul, Turkey","Demiroglu, M (corresponding author), Medeniyet Univ Gortepe EAH, Orthopaed, Istanbul, Turkey.",,,,,,,33,0,0,1,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,631.0,636,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_97,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000002,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: RPE and HREC cells were cultured in 5.5 mmol/L, glucose (control group) and 40.0 mmol/L glucose (high glucose group), respectively, according to the different culture conditions. The expression of the VEGF-B protein in RPE and HREC cells, and the expression of VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), NP-1 and cell pathway-related molecules including Erk, p-Erk, Akt, p-Akt, Src, p-Src of the two groups were recorded and compared. Results: The expression of VEGF-B, Flt-1, Erk, p-Erk, Akt and p-Akt in RPE and HREC cells of the high glucose group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). All indicators showed a trend to increase to start (6-24 h) and then decreased (> 24h). The expression of NP-1, Src and p-Src in the high glucose group was not significantly different from that in the control group (P>0.05). Conclusion: High glucose can stimulate the expression of VEGF-B in RPE and HREC cells. A high level of VEGF-B is associated with Flt-1 specificity, which will activate Erk and Akt molecules in downstream cell pathways and promote retinal neovascularisation, therefore protecting the retina from high glucose damage.","[Deng Yong-Hong; Jian Wen-Yuan; Zhao Ying] Chengdu Univ Tradit Chinese Med, 37 Shi Er Qiao Rd, Chengdu 610075, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Liu Li-Xia] Henan Vocat Coll Nursing, Dept Basic Med Sci, Anyang 455000, Henan, Peoples R China; [Ma Xiao-Li] Sichuan KeLun Biotech Biopharmaceut Co LTD, 666 Xinhua Ave, Chengdu 611138, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Zhao, Y (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Tradit Chinese Med, 37 Shi Er Qiao Rd, Chengdu 610075, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",fk1243@163.com,,,,,,20,0,0,1,9,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1923.0,1929,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_299,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400050,,,,,2022-07-14

This study aimed to evaluate the association between body mass index (BMI) with mental health and self-esteem in Iranian girls. Methods: In this case-control study, 160 girls (47 obese or overweight as the case group and 113 normal weight as the control group) aged 13 to 18 years old were recruited. Adolescents' height and weight were measured according to international standards, and BMI was calculated. Mental health status and self-esteem were measured using the validated general health questionnaire (GHQ) and the Rosenberg self-esteem questionnaire, respectively. Comparison of the variables was performed using chi-square test. Results: The mean BMI in the case group was 26.73 Kg/m2 and in the control group was 20.13 Kg/m2. 78% of cases and 21% of controls had mental disorders which significantly differed from each other (P < 0.001). Moreover, 31% of cases and 24% of controls had sufficient self-esteem. However, this difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Mental health disorders in obese girls were much higher than normal weight girls. However, there was not a significant association between obesity and self-esteem. It seems that obesity is not associated with the reduced self-esteem of Iranian girls. Further longitudinal studies with larger participants were required to achieve the psychological effects of obesity in Iranian girls.","[Doaei, S.] North Khorasan Univ Med Sci, Nat Prod & Med Plants Res Ctr, Bojnurd, Iran; [Malmir, H.] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Fac Nutr Sci, Tehran, Iran; [Kalantari, N.] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Fac Nutr Sci & Food Technol, Dept Publ Hlth Nutr, Tehran, Iran; [Majidi, N.] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Fac Nutr Sci & Food Technol, Tehran, Iran; [Doaei, S.; Gholamalizadeh, M.] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Canc Res Ctr, Student Res Comm, Tehran, Iran; [Shahvegharasl, Z.] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Fac Nutr Sci, Tabriz, Iran; North Khorasan Univ Med Sci, Hlth Sch, Dept Publ Hlth, Bojnurd, Iran; [Doaei, S.; Elahi, R.] Univ Shahrekord, Fac Vet Med, Shahrekord, Iran","Gholamalizadeh, M (corresponding author), Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Canc Res Ctr, Student Res Comm, Tehran, Iran.",gholamalizadeh@sbmu.ac.ir,"Doaei, Saeid/X-6425-2018; kalantari, naser/AAA-2857-2022","Doaei, Saeid/0000-0002-2532-7478; ",Student Research Committee of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Tehran [8182],This study was supported by the Student Research Committee of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Tehran (Code 8182).

Patients and methods: Patients who were treated in our hospital from January 2015 to April 2016, about one hundred seventy eighty of them, having femoral intertrochanteric fracture were chosen as the subjects. As per a random number table, they were divi- ded into two groups- Group A and Group B. A group of patients with PFNA minimally invasive internal fixation, B group of patients with Gamma nail internal fixation. The clinical efficacy, hip joint function, slippage of fixing needle and reset image were evaluated in both groups. Results: Compared to the control group, it was observed that Group As effective rate was greater by a significant amount (P <0.05). Compared to Group B, the operation time, discharge time and healing time were much lesser (P <0.05). The bleeding volume in group A was significantly less than that in group B (P < 0.05). In the amount of fixing needle slippage between the two groups, no main variations were found (P > 0.05). Six months after operation, the Group A patients TAD lagged behind group B patients, and the collodiaphysial angle of group A was higher than that of group B, statistically, there was much variation (P < 0.05). In the inci- dence of complications such as infection, femoral fracture, nonunion, coxa varus and dysfunction, there was not much variation between the two groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The two kinds of internal fixation both have good clinical curative effects on the elderly femoral intertrochanteric fracture, however, the PFNA minimally invasive internal fixation is more effective, with smaller changes of postoperative TAD and collodiaphysial angle.","[Dong, Qiang; Zhang, Yin-Guang; Tian, Wei] Tianjin Hosp, Dept Traumatol, 406 Jiefang South Rd, Tianjin 300211, Peoples R China","Dong, Q (corresponding author), Tianjin Hosp, Dept Traumatol, 406 Jiefang South Rd, Tianjin 300211, Peoples R China.",381245249@qq.com,,,,,,26,1,1,2,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,831.0,837,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_127,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000031,,,,,2022-07-14

Oridonin is a diterpenoid sperated from Rabdosia rubescens with potent anticancer activity. Our research's purpose is to find the function of oridonin to reverse the cisplatin-immunity in ovarian cancer cells of human. Methods: The impact of oridonin on rapid growth was assessed through MTT examination,. In addition, cell movement and incursion were assessed through transwell movement as well as incursion examination in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Cell apoptosis was examined by moving cytometry. Xenografted nude mice is used to examine the inhibitive impact of oridonin in vivo. Furthermore, real-time PCR and western blot detected the appearance of ADAM17. Results: There was a synergic antitumor effect in middle of cisplatin and oridonin on cisplatin-resistant cells of ovarian cancer in vitro as well as in vivo. Furthermore, the amalgamation of cisplatin and oridonin synergetic induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the combination treatment not only inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion, but more significantly, decreased the expression of ADAM17 protein. More importantly, ADAM17 attenuated the suppressive effect of oridonin. Conclusion: Our outcome shows that the synergic impact between both agents is probably caused by the impediment of ADAM17 and the resulting increased apoptosis.","[Dong, Yan-lei; Huang, Cui-ping] Shandong Univ, Dept Gynaecol, Hosp 2, 247 Beiyuan St, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Li, Juan] Shandong Univ, Dept Imaging, Hosp 2, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China","Huang, CP (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Dept Gynaecol, Hosp 2, 247 Beiyuan St, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.",huang982007@163.com,,,,,,28,1,1,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,819.0,825,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_125,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000029,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: 60 cases with AECOPD were randomly divided into the treatment group and control group. In addition to routine comprehensive treatment in both groups, additional 20mg Simvastatin was given to the treatment group by per os, once per night for two weeks. We observed the change of GGT activity and serum CRP concentration before and after treated in the two groups. Meanwhile, the pulmonary function measurements were performed. Results: There were no significant differences in the pulmonary function: forced expiratory volume in one second(FEV1), forced vital capacity(FVC), forced vital capacity rate of one second(FEV1/FVC), peak expiratory flow(PEF), residual volume(RV) and residual volume to total lung capacity(RV/TLC) and the serum GGT and CRP levels between the two groups before treatment. The control group showed no significant changes in any parameters before and after two-week treatment. The pulmonary function in the treatment group after two week treatment significantly improved compared with those before treatment and the control group, but the serum GGT activity and CRP levels significantly decreased. Conclusions: Simvastatin may reduce the decline in pulmonary function and decrease the levels of serum GGT and CRP of patients with AECOPD. Improvement in pulmonary function may be related to it.","[Du, Fei; Liu, Daishun; He, Gang; Chen, Daigang] First Peoples Hosp Zun Yi, Dept Resp Med, Zunyi Gui Zhou 563000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Du, F (corresponding author), First Peoples Hosp Zun Yi, Dept Resp Med, Zunyi Gui Zhou 563000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",fei632@163.com,,,Technology Division of ZunYi [[2013]02],Technology Division of ZunYi NO.

There are no studies investigating the factors affecting survival in patients treated with open abdominal technique alone. These factors should be investigated retrospectively in open abdomen patients. We aimed to investigate the factors of survival in patients with severe intraabdominal sepsis treated with vacuum-assisted closure systems for open abdomen. We hypothesized that use of open abdomen with vacuum-assisted closure systems was reduced mortality in patients with severe intraabdominal sepsis. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed 40 open abdomen patients performed vacuum-assisted closure for severe intraabdominal sepsis. Alive and mortal groups were evaluated in terms of age, gender, body mass index, etiology of surgical abdominal sepsis, Apache II score, Mannheim peritonitis index score, Bjorck classification, fascia score, abdominal defect size, stoma and fistula presence, and vacuum-assisted closure treatment duration. It was evaluated whether any of these parameters was effective on survival. Results: Mean age and body mass index were significantly elevated in the mortal group compared with the alive group. A significant difference with regard to Bjorck classification was detected between the alive and mortal groups. In Bjorck 1 and 2, mortality rates were 36.8% and 31.3%, respectively, while in Bjorck 4, mortality was 100%. The presence and ope of fistula were statistically significant for mortality. None of the other parameters were statistically significant for mortality. Discussion: The studies of the last twelve years showed that the open abdomen technique with the temporary abdominal wall closure using negative pressure dressing methods gave positive results. The 42.5% mortality rate in our study is much lower than the mortality rate for abdominal sepsis patients in the literature. Our study indicated that the management of open abdomen and negative pressure therapy was possible to increase the survival in patients with surgical abdominal sepsis.","[Egin, Seracettin; Gokcek, Berk; Yesiltas, Metin; Hot, Semih; Kamali, Sedat; Isil, Riza Gurhan; Tok, Hasan; Karahan, Servet Rustu] Saglik Bilimleri Univ, Okmeydani Educ & Res Hosp, Darulaceze Cad 25, TR-34384 Istanbul, Turkey","Egin, S (corresponding author), Saglik Bilimleri Univ, Okmeydani Educ & Res Hosp, Darulaceze Cad 25, TR-34384 Istanbul, Turkey.",seracettin_egin@hotmail.com,"Hot, Semih/ADG-3811-2022; Yeşiltaş, Metin/Q-8190-2019; Yeşiltaş, Metin/R-3639-2018; eğin, seracettin/AAR-8417-2020","Hot, Semih/0000-0001-9623-356X; Yeşiltaş, Metin/0000-0002-2080-1572; Yeşiltaş, Metin/0000-0002-2080-1572; eğin, seracettin/0000-0002-4090-5205",,,,23,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,2031.0,2036,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400068,,,,,2022-07-14

Material and methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out with 213 students at the Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Dentistry and Faculty of Health Sciences. The construct validity of the Turkish version of the scale was analyzed with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). To determine the reliability of the scale, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was calculated. In addition, for the assessment of the discrimination of each item on the scale, the top and bottom 27 % from the groups that received the lowest and highest scores from the scale were compared. Results: Standardized coefficients determined with the CFA in the Turkish version of the scale ranged between 0.34 and 0.85 in the students (Except for Item 18). The explained variance values for the items other than item 18 ranged from 0.11 to 0.72. t-values of all the factor loadings were significant. According to the reliability studies of the RIPLS, the internal consistency of Cronbach's Alpha was 0.85 for the overall scale. The t-test results showed that all the items significantly discriminated between students of high and low performance (t: 99.57; p=0.01). Conclusion: As a result, it can be said that the validity and reliability study of the RIPLS administered to Turkish healthcare students indicated that the scale was capable of measuring the Turkish-speaking students' readiness for interprofessional education.","[Ergonul, Esin] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Educ, Izmir, Turkey; [Ergonul, Esin] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Vocat Sch Hlth Serv, Izmir, Turkey; [Baskurt, Ferdi; Baskurt, Zeliha] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Phys Therapy & Rehabil, Isparta, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Nilufer Demiral] Ege Univ, Dept Med Educ, Fac Med, Izmir, Turkey; [Asci, Halil] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Fac Med, Isparta, Turkey; [Koc, Sukran] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Dept Midwifery, Fac Hlth Sci, Isparta, Turkey; [Temel, Ugur Burak] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Dent, Isparta, Turkey","Baskurt, F (corresponding author), Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Phys Therapy & Rehabil, Isparta, Turkey.",,"Ergonul, Esin/Q-2657-2019",,,,,28,3,3,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,797.0,803,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_122,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000042,,,,,2022-07-14

After the models have been set up successfully, reperfusion injury was induced, and brain tissues were taken at 2 h, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days and 21 days, and subjected to Western blot and immunofluorescence to determine changes in expressions of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3. Results: There were significant differences in the expressions of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 between the model group and the pseudo-operation group within the same periods (p < 0.05). These expressions were highest in the model group at day 1. Conclusion: These results indicate that the expressions of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 are highly enhanced after cerebral ischemia reperfusion. Thus, abnormal activation of JAK2-STAT3 signal transduction passage may be one of the mechanisms involved in nerve cell apoptosis after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury.","[Fan Lichao; Zhou Lichun] Capital Med Univ, Beijing Chao Yang Hosp, Dept Neurol, Jingxi Campus, Beijing, Peoples R China","Zhou, LC (corresponding author), 5 Jingyuan Rd, Beijing 100043, Peoples R China.",tuitgdby38697@163.com,,,,,,11,0,0,1,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,4.0,,,,,1097.0,1100,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4_168,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ1AT,WOS:000434986500031,,,,,2022-07-14

We found protein kinase C iota (PRKCI) gene had different expression in the peripheral leukocytes of patients with AMI through gene chip. Materials and methods: 20 AMI patients were randomly selected and set as the AMI group, and 20 healthy people were selected as the control group. The clinical data of all study subjects were recorded. 6 ml of venous blood was sampled from both two groups for ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein extraction; reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot were then performed to detect the expression of PRKCI gene using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and beta-actin as the internal reference, respectively. Results: There existed significant differences in low-density lipoprotein (LDL-ch) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-ch) between the two groups. At the RNA level, the relative expression of PRKCI gene in the AMI group to the control group was 0.62 +/- 0.11 (P=0.032); at the protein level, the PRKCI protein expression in the AMI group was also significantly reduced than the control group. Conclusions: The low expression of PRKCI gene takes part in the development of AMI. PRKCI gene may be used as a molecular marker for the diagnosis of AMI, even treated as a therapeutic target for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of AMI patients.","[Fan, Lin; Yang, Yushuang; Shi, Kaiyao; Liu, Dongna; Meng, Fanbo] Jilin Univ, China Japan Union Hosp, Dept Cardiovasc Med, 126 Xiantai St, Jilin 130033, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Fan, Lin] Soochow Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Echocardiog Dept, Suzhou 215006, Peoples R China; [Meng, Heyu] Yanbian Univ, Med Coll, Yanji 133000, Peoples R China","Meng, FB (corresponding author), Jilin Univ, China Japan Union Hosp, Dept Cardiovasc Med, 126 Xiantai St, Jilin 130033, Jilin, Peoples R China.",docfanbomeng@126.com,,,Excellent Talent Projects in New Century of Ministry of Education; Projects of Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Department [20090734]; Projects of Jilin Provincial Department of Finance [2012009],"This study was funded by the Excellent Talent Projects in New Century of Ministry of Education (2008), Projects of Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Department in 2009 (20090734), and Projects of Jilin Provincial Department of Finance in 2012 (2012009), and special acknowledgements should be given to Professor Zhihui Zhao and his research team for their technical guidance.",,30,0,0,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,313.0,319,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_50,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400004,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: Between 1999 and 2012, 32 patients with traumatic direct CCFs were treated endovascularly at our institution and retrospectively analyzed. All patients had cerebral angiography for the diagnosis of CCF. Treatment modalities included balloon occlusion of the CCF, sacrifice of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) with detachable balloons, coil embolization of the CCF and secondary pseudoaneurysms, and covered-stent reconstruction of the parent artery. Results: All patients were successfully managed endovascularly. Three patients were initially treated with ICA sacrifice, 19 with detachable balloons or coils, and the remaining 10 with a covered stent. At angiographic follow-up (2-24 months), four (21.1%) of the 19 patients treated with detachable balloons and coils developed a pseudoaneurysm after occlusion of the CCF, and four (21.1%) patients recurred and were retreated with ICA sacrifice in three and coil embolization in one. In total, 29 embolization procedures were performed for the 19 patients with detachable balloons or coils, and six (27.3%) patients experienced permanent ICA occlusion before the application of the covered stent. Of 10 patients with covered stents, four patients initially failed detachable balloon deployment. Clinical follow-up (12-72 months) revealed complete occlusion of all the CCFs with no recurrence of CCF symptoms and signs. Conclusion: Traumatic direct CCFs can be successfully managed endovascularly with increasingly better effects from detachable balloons to covered stent reconstruction of ICA.","[Gao, Bu-Lang; Zhang, Xue-Jing; Hao, Wei-Li; Fan, Qiong-Ying] Hebei Med Univ, Shijiazhuang Hosp 1, Dept Med Res, 36 Fanxi Rd, Shijiazhuang 050011, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Gao, Bu-Lang; Li, Cong-Hui; Yang, Song-Tao] Hebei Med Univ, Shijiazhuang Hosp 1, Dept Neurosurg, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, Peoples R China","Gao, BL (corresponding author), Hebei Med Univ, Shijiazhuang Hosp 1, Dept Med Res, 36 Fanxi Rd, Shijiazhuang 050011, Hebei, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,33,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,1.0,,,,,91.0,98,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_1_16,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AH,WOS:000424878600016,,,,,2022-07-14

This study was to investigate the safety and long-term outcome of the Enterprise stent in the treatment of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. Materials and methods: Sixty-eight patients harboring 78 intracranial aneurysms were treated with the Enterprise stent-assisted embolization with or without coiling. Angiographic data and clinical outcomes before and after stenting and at follow-up were retrospectively evaluated. Results: Seventy-seven Enterprise stents were successfully deployed in the desired position (100%). Seven procedure-related complications (10.3%) occurred including thrombosis formation in two patients, coil protrusion in two and stent dislocation in three. Twelve aneurysms were treated with stent deployment alone. Sixty-six aneurysms were treated with stent-assisted coiling, resulting in complete occlusion in 46 aneurysms (69.7%), near complete in 15 (22.7%) and incomplete in 5 (7.6%). At follow-up of 12-55 months (mean 38), progressive thrombosis occurred in 23 (71.9%) aneurysms, and aneurysm regrowth in 11 cases (18.0%). Stenting significantly (P<0.05) increased the parent artery diameters to 3.72 +/- 0.09 mm at point B and 3.43 +/- 0.1mm at D. At the last angiographic follow-up, the artery diameter was significantly (P<0.05) decreased to 3.45 +/- 0.2 mm at point B and 3.03 +/- 0.14 mm at D, with a medium asymptomatic in-stent stenosis in six patients (8.8%).

Endocrine systems are a physiological interface with the environment and genetic-environmental interactions are disrupted by EDCs. Today, there are almost 1000 chemicals reported to have endocrine effects: the prevalence of EDC in our environment and in our bodies represents a major global health challenge. This review gathers the studies that have investigated the correlations between exposure to EDC and pathologies of the female reproductive system and fetal development. Methods: A PubMed research was conducted using the keywords, their variants, and their combinations (BPA, DES, MXC, pesticides, phthalates, plasticizers, PCBs, dioxins, ovaries, oocytes, ovaries, fallopian tubes, follicles, vagina, uterus, fibroids, fertility, infertility, puberty, polycystic ovary syndrome, premature ovarian failure, birth, preterm birth, birth outcome, steroid, hormone, female, girl and menopause). Results: The endocrine system plays a central role in all vertebrates and regulates critical biological functions such as metabolism, development, reproduction, and behavior. Epidemiological studies link EDCs with reproductive effects, neuro-behavioral and neurodevelopment alterations, metabolic syndrome, bone disorders, immune disorders, and cancers in humans. Human investigations confirm the results of the studies carried out on animal showing associations with many additional effects on health, including asthma, learning and behavior problems, premature puberty, infertility, breast and prostate cancer, Parkinson's disease, obesity and other diseases. Conclusions: It is important to undertake research with follow-up methodologies and/or longitudinal studies to detect the extent of exposure of pregnant women to EDCs and halogenated substances and the effects of such exposure on brain development. A future research hypothesis may consider the effect that these substances have on neuro-development and, more specifically, how EDCs are involved in pathogenic disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In addition, a scientific study could be performed on the correlations between this type of substance and the inconveniences found in the field of executive frontal functions.","[Gigante, Elena; Moretto, Enrico; Di Sarno, Alfonso Davide; Longobardi, Teresa; Iennaco, Daniela; Messina, Martina; Nascivera, Nicole; Costa, Vania; Mosca, Luciana; Dell'Orco, Sivia] SiPGI Postgrad Sch Integrated Gestalt Psychothera, DM 12-10-2007,Via V Veneto 240, I-80058 Naples, Italy; [Picciocchi, Elisabetta; Valenzano, Anna; Cibelli, Giuseppe; Ruberto, Valentina; Pisanelli, Daniela] Univ Foggia, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Foggia, Italy; [Picciocchi, Elisabetta] Casa Cura Villa dei Fiori Acerra, Naples, Italy; [Cantone, Daniela] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Psychol, Naples, Italy; [Polito, Anna Nunzia] Osped Riuniti Foggia, Complex Struct Neuropsychiat Childhood Adolescenc, Foggia, Italy; [Marsala, Gabriella] Osped Riuniti Foggia, Azienda Osped Univ, Foggia, Italy","Gigante, E (corresponding author), SiPGI Postgrad Sch Integrated Gestalt Psychothera, DM 12-10-2007,Via V Veneto 240, I-80058 Naples, Italy.",gigantelena@gmail.com,"Moretto, Enrico/AFV-4935-2022; Cibelli, Giuseppe/AAC-2635-2019","MORETTO, ENRICO/0000-0002-1726-7866; CIBELLI, GIUSEPPE/0000-0002-5371-2584; MOSCA, LUCIA LUCIANA/0000-0001-9090-094X",,,,101,5,5,1,36,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1295.0,1303,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_199,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700021,,,,,2022-07-14

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of diabetic neuropathic pain on depression and quality of life. Material and methods: The study was designed as cross-sectional and descriptive study and was conducted between February and April of 2016 with 40 diabetic individuals diagnosed with diabetic neuropathy. Data were collected using the Diabetes Individual Identification Form, Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptom and Signs Scale, Beck's Depression Inventory and the EORTC QLQ-C30 Quality of Life Questionnaire. Verbal and written consent was obtained and the data were analyzed with the SPSS program. Results: 25 women and 15 men participated in this study. It was determined that 50% of the individuals participating in the study had had diabetes for 6-10 years, 55% had received insulin treatment and 25% had only received oral anti-diabetic (OAD) treatment. The mean score for the LANSS pain scale of diabetic subjects was 9.83, the mean score for the BECK's Depression Inventory was 18.03 and the mean score for the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire was 612. The correlation coefficient between the LANSS pain scale and the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire was significant for individuals with diabetic neuropathic pain. There was a positive correlation between the two scales (r=0.671, p=0.000 <alpha=0.05.). There was a positive but weak relationship between the LANSS Pain Scale and the BECK Depression Inventory, while no significant relationship was found between the BECK Depression Inventory and the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire for individuals with neuropathic pain (r=0.097, p=0.551>alpha=0.05.) rs=0.312, p=0.050 =alpha=0.05). Conclusion: Diabetic neuropathic pain seriously affects the quality of life and increases susceptibility to psychological problems such as depression. When using a patient-specific treatment approach for diabetes, taking into account the data on depression and quality of life will increase the patient's participation in the treatment process and the success of the treatment.","[Gokmen, Sibel] Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Ataturk Res Hosp, Izmir, Turkey; [Avdal, Elif Unsal; Uran, Berna Nilgun Ozgursoy] Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Izmir, Turkey","Avdal, EU (corresponding author), Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Izmir, Turkey.",,"AVDAL, ELİF UNSAL/ABE-9593-2021",,,,,30,0,0,1,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,643.0,650,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_99,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000004,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: USPS was sulfated by chlorosulfonic acid-pyridine method to obtain the sulfated USPS derivative (S-USPS), and MTT assay was used to determine their inhibitory effects on the growth of K562 cells at various doses (25 ug/ml, 50 ug/ml, 100 ug/ml, 200 ug/ml, 400 ug/ml, 800 ug/ml). Total reducing power of USPS and S-USPS and their scavenging capacity on hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) and superoxide anion (O2-(center dot)) were determined. Results: Results from MTT assay showed that USPS and S-USPS inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells in vitro in a time-and dose-dependent manner; 800 ug/ml S-USPS / USPS mixture controlled the growth of K562 cells at 72 h, but S-USPS had higher inhibitory effect than USPS. In addition, the total reducing power, as well as superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical scavenging capacities of S-USPS were significantly higher than the corresponding values for USPS (p < 0.05).

Pathological examination of both Whipple and DP materials requires special attention to correctly evaluate many important prognostic factors. In this study, we aimed to present the pathology results of 49 Whipple and DP materials evaluated retrospectively. Materials and method: Patients were evaluated in the Istanbul Ekin Private Pathology Laboratory between January 2010 and January 2016, operated in Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University, General Surgery Clinic between January 2016 and August 2017, and Canakkale State Hospital, General Surgery Clinic between January 2012 and January 2018. A total of 49 Whipple procedure and DP materials, both benign and malignant, were included in the study taking into consideration the age, sex, tumor size, surgical margin status, tumor localization, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, number of lymph nodes, and presence/absence of metastatic lymph nodes. Results: Out of the 49 cases, 12 (24.5%) underwent DP and 37 (75.5%) pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple). 27 (55.1%) cases were male and 22 (44.9%) were female, and the mean age was 61.4 years. 8 (16.3%) cases were benign and 41 (83.7%) were malignant. Of the 41 malignant cases, 17 were female and 24 were male; the mean age was 61.4 years. In terms of tumor localization, 6 (% 14.6) tumors were localized to the ampulla, 8 (% 19.5) to the pancreas distal, 2 (% 4.9) to the duodenum, and 25 (% 61) to the pancreas head. In 33 (% 80.5) cases, the surgical margin was intact. In 18 (% 43.9) cases, metastasis was present. Conclusion: In pancreatic carcinoma cases that are treated with either Whipple or DP, macroscopy should be assessed pathologically, and the entire piece should be diligently sampled. By doing so, parameters fundamentally affecting the survey, such as tumor type and lymph node status, will be evaluated more accurately. In addition, rate of resection in benign lesions can be slightly reduced by performing FNAB with ERCP or EUS to the masses detected by imaging in the preoperative period.","[Goret, Ceren Canbey] Hlth Sci Univ, Sancaktepe Res & Educ Hosp, Dept Surg Pathol, TR-34000 Istanbul, Turkey; [Goret, Nuri Emrah] Hlth Sci Univ, Kartal Res & Educ Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ozkan, Omer Faruk] Hlth Sci Univ, Umraniye Res & Educ Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Istanbul, Turkey; [Kilic, Guray] Private Ekin Pathol, Dept Surg Pathol, Istanbul, Turkey","Goret, CC (corresponding author), Hlth Sci Univ, Sancaktepe Res & Educ Hosp, Dept Surg Pathol, TR-34000 Istanbul, Turkey.",,,,,,,23,2,2,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,4.0,,,,,1041.0,1045,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4_159,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ1AT,WOS:000434986500022,,,,,2022-07-14

The association of soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2 (ST2) levels with mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure has been established. We investigated the relationship between ST2 levels in patients with acute decompensated heart failure and the length of stay. Materials and methods: This study included 143 patients who were hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure. The average length of stay was 4 days. Patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 consisted of patients who stayed 4 days or less; group 2 consisted of patients who stayed more than 4 days. Results: The serum ST2 levels were greater in the group 2 as compared to the group 1 (32 ng/mL (3-68 ng/mL) versus 47 ng/mL (9-298 ng/mL) (P < 0.001). The optimal cutoff level of ST2 in the prediction of length of stay was > 39 U/mL, with a specificity of 95.8% and a sensitivity of 96% (area under the curve, 0.979; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.953-0.992).

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the pulmonary function of 56 patients. These patients were divided into three groups: phenotype A (Airway type), phenotype E (Emphysema type), and phenotype M (Mix type). Pulmonary function test (PFT) and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) were performed within three days. The imaging classification of patients was based on emphysema and bronchiectasis, which was assessed on HRCT images. Furthermore, the clinical characteristics and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) graduation among the different phenotypes were analyzed. Results: The smoking index of phenotype A, phenotype E and phenotype M was 359.47 +/- 114.24, 468.00 +/- 119.42 and 400.7 +/- 136.87, respectively, and the difference in smoking index among these three phenotypes was statistically significant (P<0.001). In phenotype A, the GOLD grade was mild in five patients, moderate in 21 patients, severe in four patients, and critically severe in one patient. In phenotype E, the GOLD grade was mild in one patient, moderate in two patients, severe in six patients, and critically severe in two cases. In phenotype M, GOLD grade was mild in one patient, moderate in three patients, severe in eight patients and critically severe in two patients. The difference in GOLD grades among these different phenotypes was statistically significant (P=0.006). Conclusion: Smoking is one of the risk factors that lead to emphysema. Patients with phenotype M had emphysema and bronchial wall thickening at the same time. Furthermore, these patients had the most severe airflow limitation, severe and critically severe GOLD grades, and the most obvious lung function damage in the middle and late stages of the disease.","[He, Qian; He, Shi-Zhen; Su, Yun-Shan; Wang, Peng; Xiang, Shu-Tiang; Su, Wei; Mao, Chong-Wen] Kunming Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 4, Peoples Hosp Yunnan Prov 2, Dept Radiol, Kunming 650000, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Xiang, ST (corresponding author), Kunming Med Univ, Dept Radiol, Peoples Hosp Yunnan Prov 2, 176 Qingnian St, Kunming 650000, Yunnan, Peoples R China.;Xiang, ST (corresponding author), Kunming Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 4, 176 Qingnian St, Kunming 650000, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,4.0,,,,,1031.0,1036,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4_157,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ1AT,WOS:000434986500020,,,,,2022-07-14

Now, TACE has evolved into the first choice among non-surgical HCC's for its minimally invasive nature and definite therapeutic effects. However, this technique was beset with relative high incidence of complications plus low cure rate. For optimal TACE's antitumor effect, many efforts have been made in varies aspects of TACE procedure including alterative contrast agent, combination therapies, newly developed embolizing agents and evaluation techniques et al.

Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) has been accepted as a prognostic marker of ovarian reserve. The relationship between BMI and serum AMH levels has not been well documented. The main purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between BMI and AMH level in IVF candidate infertile women referred to an infertility clinic. Materials and methods: through a cross-sectional study, IVF candidates were recruited. BMI and serum AMH were measured. Then, stimulation of ovulation began on days 3-4. Patients were assigned to three groups with poor ovarian response (<= 3 oocytes), adequate ovarian response (4-12 oocytes) and excessive ovarian response (>12 oocytes) based on the number of oocytes retrieved. Results: The results of linear regression showed no significant relationship between AMH levels and BMI (P = 0.8). Only in overweight individuals, the likelihood of forming an oocyte was 10% higher than those with normal BMI, and this relationship was not observed for obese subjects (P = 0.3). In obese people, there is no relationship between AMH levels and poor and excessive ovarian responses. Discussion and conclusion: this study showed that AMH does not correlate with BMI. In obese infertile women, AMH is not an appropriate indicator of ovarian response.","[Heidar, Zahra; Bahramzadeh, Sarah; Motevasselian, Mahtab; Nazari, Behnaz Amir] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, IRHRC, Tehran, Iran","Bahramzadeh, S (corresponding author), Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, IRHRC, Tehran, Iran.",sarah.bahramzadeh@hotmail.com,"Heidar, zahra/AAC-4809-2019",,,,,27,1,1,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,329.0,335,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_52,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400006,,,,,2022-07-14

Aims: This study was to investigate the effect of oral administration of taurodehydrocholic acid (TDHC) on cholesterol metabolism. Materials and methods: TDHC was administered orally at a concentration of 10mM twice a day to rats for 7 days in order to mimic the in vivo situation in gallstone patients on bile salt therapy. Bile duct was cannulated and bile was collected for 30 mins on ice and subjected to analysis for total cholesterol, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT). Liver samples were subjected to real time PCR and the gene expression of the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter heterodimer Abcg5/g8 was determined. Results: TDHC significantly increased the expression of Abcg5 whilst the level of Abcg8 was significantly decreased. No changes in biliary cholesterol, ALP and GGT were observed, however the total bilirubin was significantly increased in the bile of TDHC administered rats. Conclusions: Increased expression of Abcg5 may be one mechanism by which TDHC stimulates the secretion of biliary cholesterol.","[Hismiogullari, Adnan Adil] Univ Balikesir, Sch Med, Dept Med Biochem, Balikesir, Turkey; [Hismiogullari, Sahver Ege] Univ Balikesir, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol, Balikesir, Turkey; [Sel, Tevhide] Univ Ankara, Sch Vet Med, Dept Biochem, Ankara, Turkey; [Kilic, Oktay] Univ Balikesir, Sch Med, Dept Psychol, Balikesir, Turkey; [Rahman, Khalid] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Pharm & Biomol Sci, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England","Hismiogullari, AA (corresponding author), Balikesir Univ, Sch Med, Cagis Yerleskesi, TR-10145 Balikesir, Turkey.",,,,,,,30,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,1.0,,,,,33.0,38,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_1_5,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AH,WOS:000424878600005,,,,,2022-07-14

In this research, non-surgical rehabilitation treatment was applied for basketball player with PLC rupture, and followed investigations of therapeutic effects were performed. Method: In this work, 50 basketball players with simple PCL rupture, who had been treated in our hospital from Apr 2012 to Apr 2016, were selected as research objects, and all the selected basketball players were injured due to basketball reason. For all the selected players, a 5-stage non-surgical rehabilitation scheme with gradually increased load was applied. The ,first stage began from the 1st day to the 5th day since got injured; the second stage started from the 6th day to the 20th day since got injured; the third stage started from the 21st day to the 25th day since got injured; the fourth stage began from the 26th day to the 30th day since got injured; and the last stage started from one month later since gut injured, during which injured players were allowed to train with their team, in the hope of maintaing their physical strengths by gradually increasing exercise amount. From the 38th to the 78th day since ,got injured, KT2 test was performed to test the stress levels of quadriceps femoris of their both legs. Results: Through rehabilitation treatment, injured players can return to basketball training after averagely 38 days since get injured, morevoer the quadriceps,femoris strength of injured leg can recover to around 102% level of that of the non-injured leg. At the first test, the ratio between injured knee strength and non-injured knee strength was 0.52:1, can then increased to 0.96:1 at the 14th day since got injured. After returing to basketball training, knee joint injuries did not reappear, the therapeutic effect was ideal and the satisfaction degree on the treatment was high. Conclusion: Regarding simple PCL rupture of basketball player, non-surgical rehabilitation treatment can achieve ideal therapeutic effect, promote the function recovery of knee joint , significantly reduce and eliminate symptoms of knee joint, and accelerate the recovery as soon as possible.","[Hu, Jiang] Shihezi Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Shihezi 832000, Peoples R China","Hu, J (corresponding author), Shihezi Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Shihezi 832000, Peoples R China.",214099889@qq.com,,,,,,18,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,3.0,,1561.0,1564,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GP7NG,WOS:000441088400017,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: The AA model was established by Freund's complete adjuvant. The rats were dosed on the 12th day after inflammation. Forty rats were randomly divided into normal control (NC) group, model control (MC) group, XFC group, tripterygium wilfordii (TPT) group. After administration for 30 days, MVD, platelet parameters, platelet microparticles (CD61 + CD41 + PMPs), VEGF, ES, VEGF / ES, PTEN, PI3K, AKT, P-AKT, BAD were observed. Results: Compared with NC group, the expressions of MVD, CD61 + CD41 + PMP, PLT, PCT, VEGF and VEGF mRNA in MC group were significantly lower than those in NC group, and ES mRNA was elevated. Expression of PTEN, BAD protein decreased, and PI3K, AKT, P-AKT protein increased. Compared with MC group, the expression of MVD, CD61 + CD41 + PMPs, platelet parameters PLT and PCT decreased in XFC group, the expression of VEGF, VEGF mRNA decreased, the expression of ES mRNA in peripheral blood ES and synovial blood vessel increased, ES mRNA decreased. PTEN, BAD protein expression increased, PI3K, AKT, P-AKT protein decreased. Compared with TPT group, expression of CD61 + CD41 + PMPs decreased in XFC group. Expression of PI3K, P-AKT protein decreased, and BAD increased (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). Conclusion: The abnormal expression of PMPs can break the balance of VEGF and inhibit the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in the abnormal proliferation of synovial microvessels. XFC can significantly inhibit the proliferation of synovial tissue in AA rats. The mechanism may be through up-regulating the expression of PTEN, inhibiting the activation of PI3K / AKT pathway, up-regulating Bad, regulating the balance of VEGF / ES, inhibiting platelet release and improving angiogenesis.","[Huang Chuanbing; Wan Lei; Liu Jian; Liu Lei] Anhui Univ Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Hefei 230031, Anhui, Peoples R China","Liu, L (corresponding author), Anhui Univ Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Hefei 230031, Anhui, Peoples R China.",yxwanlei@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation [81473672]; Anhui University Natural Science Research Project [KJ2017A281]; Anhui Province Natural Science Foundation [1208085MH180]; Anhui Provincial Department of Health in Chinese medicine research project [2012zy28]; Anhui University of Chinese Medicine exploratory research projects; Anhui Provincial Key Laboratory of Modern Traditional Chinese Medicine Internal Medicine Application Foundation and Development Research [1606c08238]; Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [1508085QH159],This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation Project (81473672).

The protective mechanism of miRNA-146a was also investigated in this study. Methods: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) model was constructed on rats with swimming exercise pretreatment. TTC stain was used to evaluate the myocardiac infarct area. The differential expression of miRNA in infarcted myocardium was tested by miRNA sequencing. RT-PCR was used to verify the expression of miRNA-146a. Apoptosis was tested by flow-cytometry and caspase-3 activity assay. One-way ANOVA and t-test analyses were utilized to identify differences between groups. Results: Physiological myocardial hypertrophy was induced by swimming exercise. Heart weight/body weight and Heart weight/tibia length in swimming group were significantly more than that in control group (p<0.05). The cardiac infarction area was significant less in swimming exercise group compared to sedentary group (p<0.01). The expression of miRNA-146a was down-regulated significantly in the infarcted myocardium with swimming exercise (p<0.05). MiRNA-146a mimics could induce the apoptosis in anoxial cardiac myocytes (p<0.05, compared with normal and miRNA-146a inhibitor group). Caspase-3 activity was strongest when the anoxial cardiac myocytes treated with miRNA-146a mimic. Overexpression of in cardiac myocytes increase caspase-3 activity followed by promoting apoptosis (p<0.05, compared with normal and miRNA-146a inhibitor group). Conclusions: Swimming exercise can attenuate cardiac infarction area in rat AMI model.

Methods: 40 CHD children were divided into two groups: Group A (2 <= age <= 6, n=20) and Group B (6 <= age <= 12, n=20). The children's blood volume was calculated according to the blood volume formula. The indexes of plasma colloid osmotic pressure (PCOP), plasma Voluven concentration and hemoglobin (HGB) were measured with central venous blood prior to the transfusion of Voluven (T0), 15 min after the transfusion (T1), and 30 min after the transfusion (T2) respectively. The urine generated between the start of transfusion and 30 min after the completion of transfusion was kept to measure Voluven concentration in urine. Results: The dilatation proportion is about 100%. In comparison with T0, HGB of the two groups lowers at T1 and T2 (P < 0.05) and the difference of HGB between the two groups has no statistical significance (P > 0.05). Compared with T0, PCOP in Group B increases at T1 and T2 (P < 0.05) while the difference of PCOP in Group A at T1 and T2 has no statistical significance (P > 0.05).

Material and method: In this retrospective, case-control study, the vitamin levels of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who were followed-up and treated between 2012 and 2016 at the hematology clinic of Ministry of Health Istanbul Training and Research Hospital were evaluated in order to compare with the vit D levels of healthy individuals who were taken as control group in the same period. Results: In the study, 29 patients with AML, 17 patients with ALL and 50 healthy controls were included. There was a statistically significant difference between Vit D levels of patients group and control group (p= 0.001). The Vit D level of control group was statistically higher than those of ALL and AML patients. (p = 0.005; p = 0.001, respectively).

However, there was no statistical significance between Vit D levels of AML and ALL patients (p = 0.524). Conclusion: Vit D levels of patients with acute leukemia were found to be lower than those of healthy controls. In case patients with hematological malignancy have Vit D deficit, especially in the case of serious deficiencies, the replacement therapy should be administered. Prospective randomized controlled trials on multiple cases of acute leukemia are needed to clarify the effects of Vit D deficiency on disease progression and survival.","[Icacan, Ozan Cemal; Sametoglu, Fettah] Istanbul Training & Res Hosp, Minist Hlth, Dept Internal Dis, Istanbul, Turkey; [Yokus, Osman] Istanbul Training & Res Hosp, Minist Hlth, Dept Hematol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Gedik, Habip] Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Training & Res Hosp, Minist Hlth, Dept Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol, Istanbul, Turkey","Gedik, H (corresponding author), Bakirkoy Sadi Konuk Egitim & Arastirma Hastanesi, Infeksiyon Hastaliklari & Klin Mikrobiyol Klin, Istanbul, Turkey.",habipgedik@yahoo.com,"Gedik, Habip/ABI-3946-2020; Yokus, Osman/ABF-5160-2020","Gedik, Habip/0000-0002-8406-2254; ",,,,13,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1883.0,1887,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_292,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400043,,,,,2022-07-14

Although it has been emphasized that rehabilitation clinics are important places to be taken into consideration in the transmission of HCAIs, the number of studies about the students from department of physiotherapy and rehabilitation (DPR) are limited. Thus, our research was done to examine the HH knowledge level of students of DPR. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study was done by 191 volunteers from a total of 209 first and second-year students. We recorded the sociodemographic characteristics. Based on the suggestions commented in the Center for Disease Control and Prevention Guideline for HH in Health Care Settings, HH knowledge levels were assessed using face to face interview technique. Results: The average correct answer rate to the questions about the HH knowledge level was 69.49%. The level of knowledge about the importance of HH was good, but the correct response rates for terminology and alcohol-based handrub were less than 50%. Conclusions: Since DPR students form an important ring in the therapy chain, so in the development of educational programs for the students of DPR, it is very important to improve their knowledge level especially about terminology and alcohol-based handrub techniques.","[Ilgin, Duygu; Karaali, Hayriye Kul; Ozcan, Ozlem] Manisa Celal Bayar Univ, Dept Physiotherapy & Rehabil, Fac Hlth Sci, Manisa, Turkey; [Arslan, Serdar] Necmettin Erbakan Univ, Dept Physiotherapy & Rehabil, Fac Hlth Sci, Konya, Turkey; [Arslan, Tugba] Pamukkale Univ, Hlth Sci Inst, Denizli, Turkey; [Gunduz, Turan; Limoncu, Mehmet Emin] Manisa Celal Bayar Univ, Manisa Hlth Serv Vocat Sch, Manisa, Turkey","Ilgin, D (corresponding author), Manisa Celal Bayar Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Physiotherapy & Rehabil, Uncubozkoy Hlth Campus, Yunusemre Manisa, Turkey.",,"ILGIN, DUYGU/ABD-6345-2020; Ilgın, Duygu/AAA-1543-2021",,,,,32,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,749.0,757,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_115,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000020,,,,,2022-07-14

Inflammation is the probable underlying cause of disability. Platelet indices and complete blood compounds such as neutrophils and leukocytes are used to assess inflammation. This study investigated the relation between inflammation and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW) in RA and AS. Materials and methods: 425 subjects aged 17-89 (mean 44.64 +/- 14.07), 225 (52.9%) female and 200 (47.1%) male, were included in this retrospective study. One hundred five subjects had RA, 216 had AS, and 104 were healthy. RA was diagnosed based on 2010 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria and AS according to Modified New York Criteria. RA disease activity was determined using DAS28 scores and AS disease activity using BASDAI. Results: Hemoglobin values in patients with RA were statistically significantly lower compared to the control group (p=0.001), while ESR, CRP, NLR and PLR values were higher (p=0.001, p=0.001, p=0.001, and p=0.040). No difference was determined in MPV or PDW (p>0.05). Hemoglobin, ESR, CRP and NLR values in AS patients were significantly higher than in the control group (p=0.001, p=0.001, p=0.006, and p=0.001), while PDW values were lower (p=0.027; p<0.05). No difference was determined in PLR or MPV values (p>0.05). No correlation was determined between disease activity indices and NLR, PLR, MPV, PDW. Conclusion: Being cost-effective and easily calculated, NLR and PLR in RA and NLR in AS can be used together with ESR and CRP or as inflammation markers when these are unavailable.","[Illeez, Ozge Gulsum; Ozkan, Feyza Unlu; Aktas, Ilknur] Univ Hlth Sci, Fatih Sultan Mehmet Training & Res Hosp, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Istanbul, Turkey","Illeez, OG (corresponding author), E5 Karayolu Uzeri, TR-34752 Istanbul, Turkey.",ozgeilleez@hotmail.com,"ozkan, feyza unlu/AAC-4013-2019; AKTAŞ, İLKNUR/AAC-3173-2021",,,,,32,7,7,2,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1751.0,1756,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_268,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400019,,,,,2022-07-14

Early detection of prognostic markers for the two diseases can be extremely useful. The present study aims to investigate the correlation between uricemia and N-terminal Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-pro-BNP) in patients with both HF and COPD, the latter condition being known as an aggravating factor for HF. Materials and methods: A total of 101 patients with HF were enrolled. All patients were evaluated through clinical history, physical examination, cardiovascular risk factors, chest X ray, pulmonary function tests, echocardiography and their serum uric acid (UA) and NT-pro-BNP levels (on the first day of admission) were determined. Results: We noticed a significant correlation between NT-pro-BNP and uric acid levels (r=0.409, p=0.0001). Correlation was present in both sexes, with a higher prevalence in men (r=0.43, p=0.0034) than in women (r=0.38, p=0.012). By looking only at COPD patients, the correlation between NT-pro-BNP and uric acid persisted (r=0.47, p=0.010). Comparing the two genders, in COPD patients the correlation was stronger in women (r=0.57, p=0.031) than in men (r=0.40, p=NS). In non-COPD patients, correlation between NT-pro-BNP and uric acid levels was also positive and statistically significant (r=0.41, p=0.0013). By gender, correlation was stronger in women (r=0.56, p=0.0014) than in men (r=0.18, p=NS). Conclusion: Even though NT-pro-BNP values were lower in COPD patients, we found a direct correlation between NT- proBNP and uric acid in both COPD and non-COPD patients, and both findings can be regarded as potential contributors to a negative course of HF.","[Iosip, Adriana; Pop, Dana; Sitar-Taut, Adela; Niculescu, Ioana; Caloian, Bogdan; Zdrenghea, Dumitru; Zdrenghea, Mihnea] Univ Med & Pharm Iuliu Hatieganu, Cluj Napoca, Romania","Pop, D (corresponding author), Clin Rehabil Hosp, Cardiol Dept, Viilor St 46-50,2nd Floor,Room 222, Cluj Napoca, Cluj Cty, Romania.",pop67dana@gmail.com,"Zdrenghea, Mihnea/V-3373-2019","Zdrenghea, Mihnea/0000-0002-9461-987X",,,,29,0,0,0,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,1.0,,,,,189.0,195,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_1_31,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AH,WOS:000424878600031,,,,,2022-07-14

As well, patient group with thalassemia trait (minor) is considered as iron deficiency anemia erroneously in daily practice and this group is subjected to excess iron treatment unnecessarily. In this study, if unnecessary iron load in the patients with thalassemia minor had any effect on insulin resistance was assessed. Materials and methods: A two-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in 30 thalassemia carrier patients and 30 gender-age-history matched healthy individuals. Glucose and insulin levels were measured at time zero, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), whole-body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI), were calculated and the association between acute phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP) and insulin resistance was investigated. Results: There was no significant difference between study group and control group with respect to age, gender and body mass index (BMI) parameters. Insulin resistance (IR) parameters were compared within two groups and no statistical significance was determined. Groups were classified in two subgroups according to BMI value: Subgroups with BMI > 25 kg/m(2) and subgroups with BMI < 25 kg/m(2). When considered with respect to same BMI values, there was no difference between patient and control groups regarding glucose metabolism parameters and CRP levels. Insulin resistance was more evident inherently regarding BMI difference. Conclusion: It was concluded that glucose metabolisms in patients with thalassemia trait did not show difference compared to BMI-matched healthy individuals. Detecting insulin resistance to be increased in both groups as BMI increased was suggestive of main factor causing disturbances in glucose metabolism in the patients thalassemia trait was obesity.","[Isiklar, A.] Univ Hlth Sci, Fatih Sultan Mehmet Training & Res Hosp, Istanbul, Turkey; [Karsidag, K.] Istanbul Univ, Istanbul Sch Med, Istanbul, Turkey","Isiklar, A (corresponding author), E5 Highway, TR-34752 Atasehir, Turkey.",aysunisiklar@gmail.com,"Karşıdağ, Kubilay/AAD-7442-2020","Isiklar, Aysun/0000-0003-2690-3067",,,,32,1,1,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,321.0,327,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_51,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400005,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: 60 voluntary patients admitted to the emergency department for various reasons who had underwent contrast-enhanced computerized tomography scans were included in the study. Blood samples for NGAL, creatinine were taken . from the peripheral veins of the patients; pre exposure (0 hours) and post exposure to contrast agent on the 4th and 24th hours were examined for contrast computed tomography. Results: NGAL value was measured 4 hours after the administration of the contrast agent in our study and was significantly increased (p<0.05), however the creatinine value did not show a statistically significant change (p>0.05). When NGAL values were considered in relation to age, a significant increase was observed in patients over sixty years of age (p<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups based on the creatinine values (p>0.05). Conclusion: It was determined in the present study that NGAL indicates more significant results in comparison with creatinine with regard to the early diagnosis of contrast-induced nephropathy which can develop in patients who underwent a contrast-enhanced tomography scan. It is believed that NGAL can be the reagent which replaces creatinine in future studies for the early diagnosis of contrast-induced nephropathy particularly for patients aged 60 and above.

In recent years, many countries have attempted to reform in this area to be reduced the number of false visits to the emergency department and utilization of medical services in pre-hospital and hospital emergency to be done reasonably and properly. Methods: This research is a descriptive study and with comparative approach. Developed countries in different parts of the world on the basis of having accepted models of service delivery and availability of information were selected. Information about mechanism of payment of costs of emergency care in the countries studied is collected and then on the basis of comparative tables, factors affecting the pattern of payment of costs of emergency care in the form of integrated management of pre-hospital and hospital emergency of studied countries were extracted. Results: A significant difference can be observed between the number of visits to emergency departments for every 1,000 people in selected countries and Iran; Iran and Australia has the largest number of outpatients to emergency departments and has the largest number of patients admitted in the emergency departments but the proportion of patients admitted in all visits to the emergency department is slightly higher than other countries; there are multiple payment mechanisms for those involved in providing emergency medical services. In addition, payment systems to pre-hospital and hospital emergency in a country often have different mechanisms. Conclusion: Despite the lack of financial and human resources in the health system of Iran, to meet the expectations of patients needing emergency care, we need to reform emergency services and this action requires a reorganization of pre-hospital emergency and upgrade the emergency department at the hospital and enjoying budget resources of outpatient care in pre-hospital emergency to pay for treatment of outpatients outside of hospital emergency department using effective approaches on improving payment mechanism in pre-hospital and hospital emergency in Iran.","[Jamalmohammadi, Ali] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Hlth Serv Adm, Sci & Res Branch, Hlth Serv Management, Tehran, Iran; [Tabibi, Seyed Jamaledin; Riahi, Leila; Farahani, Mahmoud Mahmoudi Majdabadi] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Hlth Serv Adm, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran","Tabibi, SJ (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Hlth Serv Adm, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran.",alijamalmohammdi@yahoo.com; sjtabibi@yahoo.com,,,,,,21,0,0,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,2.0,,569.0,573,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2s_90,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7SD,WOS:000429274400004,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: Sepsis was induced in female Kunming mice with cecal ligation and puncture operation (CLP). The experiment group were administered nicotine (400 mu g/kg) 30 minutes before and three times daily for 3 days after sepsis induction. Survival of mice was observed up to 7 days after CLP in a total of 65 mice. In a separate experiment, the severity of the sepsis was evaluated and lung and liver histopathological examinations were performed (n=18). In the third experiment (n=120), we examined the temporal levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta) in mouse plasma corresponding to varying doses (40-400 mu g/kg) of nicotine administered. Results: Nicotine (400 mu g/kg) significantly increased the survival rate of CLP mice compared to those of the control group (56.7% vs. 20%; P<0.01). It could attenuate sepsis severity (15.00 +/- 3.58 in experiment group vs. 21.00 +/- 2.37 in CLP group; P<0.05) and decrease the lung wet/dry weight ratio (2.30 +/- 1.03 vs. 2.71 +/- 1.58 in CLP group; P<0.05). It could also ameliorate hepatic and lung damage. Six hours after administration, nicotine (400 mu g/kg) significantly decreased the serum levels of TNF-alpha (531.79 +/- 8.14 vs. 731.11 +/- 42.56 in CLP group; P<0.01) and IL-1 beta (245.19 +/- 35.03 vs. 556.12 +/- 7.08 in CLP group; P<0.01). Conclusions: Nicotine has protective effects against sepsis in mice, and it could be attributed to its activation of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines.","[Jia, Baohui; Liu, Ning] Zhengzhou Railway Technol Vocat Coll, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yi; Huang, Min; Shang, Mingsheng; Wu, Lili; Yan, Zhijie] Nanchang Univ, Hosp 4, Dept Crit Care Med, Nanchang 330003, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiangyang] Zhengzhou Univ, Zhengzhou Cent Hosp, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, Peoples R China","Jia, BH (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Railway Technol Vocat Coll, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, Peoples R China.",bhjia@126.com,,,,,,17,2,2,1,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,1.0,,,,,139.0,144,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_1_23,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AH,WOS:000424878600023,,,,,2022-07-14

Here we sought to explore the potential role of Aquaporin 5 (AQP-5) in breast cancer metastasis and clarify the involvement of MAPK pathway via specific inhibition. Methods: In vitro culture MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. AQP-5 targeting siRNA was designed with software and synthesized to suppress AQP-5 expression. Cells were transfected with either sham, scramble or AQP-5 siRNA. In addition, specific inhibitor SB203580 was employed to block MAPK pathway. Cell growth was monitored by CCK-8 proliferation assay. The change of MAPK pathway factors were determined by western blotting. Invasion capacity was evaluated by trans-well assay. And extracellular matrix protease activities of MMP-2, 9 were measured by Gelatin Zymography. Results: Both transcript and protein of AQP-5 were efficiently decreased by siRNA. Cell proliferation was significantly suppressed upon AQP-5 knockdown. Phosphorylation but not the total protein of p38 was elevated. Knockdown of AQP-5 impaired invasion of MCF-7 in trans-well assay and reduced MMP-2, 9 enzymatic activities in gelatin zymogram, which could be reversed by simultaneous treatment with SB203580. Conclusions: Suppression the expression of AQP-5 inhibits proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cell line MCF-7 via activation of MAPK pathway. This effect was counteracted by MAPK specific inhibitor SB203580, which suggested the predominant role of MAPK pathway in mediating tumor suppression in this setting.","[Jia, Baoqing; Sun, Shengrong] Wuhan Univ, Renmin Hosp, Dept Breast & Thyroid Surg, 95 Zhangzhidong Rd, Wuhan 430060, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Li, Hui] Inner Mongolia Peoples Hosp, Dept Oncol, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China; [Cha, Nier; Bao, Wenhua; Zhao, Ruigang] Inner Mongolia Peoples Hosp, Dept Breast Surg, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China","Sun, SR (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Renmin Hosp, Dept Breast & Thyroid Surg, 95 Zhangzhidong Rd, Wuhan 430060, Hubei, Peoples R China.",shengrongsun886@126.com,,,,,,27,1,1,1,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1397.0,1403,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_213,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700035,,,,,2022-07-14

It also provides a clinical prevention and treatment method for hemorrhagic transformation, which provides a theoretical basis for the risk assessment of patients in the future. A retrospective analysis method was used to analyze 60 patients who failed to respond to thrombolysis or were not willing to accept thrombolytic therapy in our emergency department of Neurology in January 2016 - January 2017. Hemorrhagic transformation was used as a sign, which was divided into hemorrhagic transformation, group and non-hemorrhagic transformation group. There were 30 patients in each group. The basic information, clinical indicators and imaging data of patients' medical records were collected. After that, SPSS 20 software was used for statistical analysis. Logistic regression analysis showed that the ficctors of the difference were statistic-ally significant for a total of 5. They are the infarction area (OR=3.48, CI: 1.41-8.86, P=0.006); NIHSS score (OR=1.068, CI: 1.014-1.128, P=0.009), high blood lipids (OR=2.78, CI: 1.36-5.62, P=0.009), diabetes mellitus (OR=1.062, CI: 0.967-1.284, P=0.006), urine protein (OR=2.12, CI: 1.68-3.06, P=0.000).

Methods: A total of 100 cases of children diagnosed with mycoplasma pneumonia and treated in our hospital from March 2014 to March 2017 were randomly divided into control group and observation group (50 cases in each group). The control group was treated with azithromycin, while the observation group was treated with methylprednisolone combined with azithromycin. Hospital stays, treatment time, clinical symptoms, symptom disappearance time, incidence of adverse reactions, and effect of clinical treatment in the two groups were analyzed statistically. At the same time, the concentrations of PCT, hs-CRP, cardiac troponin and IL-2 in serum of the two groups were determined and analyzed before and after treatment, using magnetic particle chemiluminescence (quantitative). Results: The total treatment effectiveness in the observation group was 96%, which was significantly higher than 84% in the control group (p < 0.05). Fever cessation time, disappearance time of cough and hales, hospital stays and healing time in the observation group were all significantly shorter than those in the control group (p < 0.05). The incidence of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, injection site pain and liver function impairment in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (p < 0.05). The levels of PCT, hs-CRP, cardiac troponin in both groups decreased after treatment, while the IL-2 increased. There was a significant difference between values before and after treatment (p < 0.05). The degrees of changes jn PCT, hs-CRP, cardiac troponin and IL-2 in the observation group before and after treatment were significantly higher than those in the control group.

Methods: Acupressure of semen coicis at the junction point of the antihelical crura of each auricular with waist exercise was employed to treat patients with acute lower-back pain between the period of 2006 to 2014. The visual analogue scale (VAS) on pain was used to evaluate the effects of the treatment. Results: This study included 210 patients (82 males/128 females, mean age: 47.5 years, disease duration: four hours to three weeks). After the first office-visit treatments, acute pain and the limited movement of all patients (n=210) were significantly relieved. Most of these cases recovered and returned to work after one week of self-treatment. Among the 193 cases that were followed-up, low-back pain disappeared after one, two and three weeks of treatments in 110 (57%), 60 (31%) and 14 (7.3%) cases, respectively. Furthermore, nine (4.7%) cases became chronic low-back pain, in which acute low-back pain occurred within two weeks of their first office-visit and treatment. Conclusion: Auricular point acupressure with waist exercise is an effective treatment for acute low-back pain rehabilitation. Early treatment ascertains better rehabilitative effects. This treatment would most likely replace the dislocated spine joints and stimulate endogenous anesthetic effects.","[Jiao, Hong-Xin; Hu, Jian-Hua; Lu, Wen-Qing] Second Peoples Hosp Kunshan, Dept Orthopaed, 142 Zhongshan Rd, Kunshan 215300, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Jiao, HX (corresponding author), Second Peoples Hosp Kunshan, Dept Orthopaed, 142 Zhongshan Rd, Kunshan 215300, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,19,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,4.0,,,,,1105.0,1110,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4_170,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ1AT,WOS:000434986500033,,,,,2022-07-14

However, classical media used for generating MSCs are typically augmented with ill-defined supplements, such as fetal bovine serum, which increases safety concerns as well as inconsistency in MSC generation. We tested three commercial serum-free media for the generation and expansion of rabbit MSCs (rbMSCs). Materials and methods: RbMSCs were separated by adherent tissue culture and cultured in serum-free or serum-containing media. Cultured cells were characterized by phase contrast microscopy, cell-proliferation, flow cytometry, and qPCR analyses. Results: MesenCult (R) XF medium supported the generation and expansion of rbMSCs, whereas StemPro (R) hMSC and BD Mosaic hMSC media did not propagate freshly isolated rbMSCs. At passage 5, total cell yields for serum-containing and MesenCult (R) XF media were 4.0 +/- 0.16 x 108 and 1.9 +/- 0.28 x 109, and cumulative population doublings were 11.5 +/- 0.12 and 13.08 +/- 0.19, respectively. Colony formation efficiencies in MesenCult (R) XF were 21 to 26%, whereas those in serum-containing medium were 14 to 17%. Flow cytometry showed that rbMSCs in MesenCult (R) XF were positive for CD29, CD44 and CD73, and negative for CD34 and CD45. After corresponding differentiation, rbMSCs from MesenCult (R) XF could differentiate into adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages. qPCR analysis demonstrated that cells cultured in serum-free media had higher differentiation potentials than those cultured in serum-containing media. Discussion: rbMSCs were efficiently generated and expanded in MesenCult (R) XF, while maintaining the necessary characteristics attributed to MSCs for potential therapeutic use.","[Jin, Lifang] Shaoxing Univ, Coll Life Sci, Shaoxing, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Jin, Lifang; Hua, Yunfen; Cao, Huanhuan; Zhang, Ming] Hangzhou Precis Med Res Ctr, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Zhang, M (corresponding author), Hangzhou Precis Med Res Ctr, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zhangming_ls@zju.edu.cn,,,Zhejiang Province Science and Technology Project of China [2013C33189],This work was supported by research grants from the Zhejiang Province Science and Technology Project of China [grant number 2013C33189].,,25,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,811.0,817,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_124,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000028,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: A total of 50 Wistar rats were randomly divided into the normal group, the model group, the fluticasone propionate group, the raw white mustard seed plaster group and the fried white mustard seed plaster group, with 10 rats in each group. OVA hen ovalbumin was used to prepare rat models of AR, and they were treated by intranasal administration with fluticasone propionate and acupoint application therapy respectively, and behavioral scoring was performed before and after treatment. After treatment, rats in different groups were treated with HE staining to observe the shape of nasal mucosa. The expression of TLR4 and NF-kappa B mRNA in the nasal mucosa was detected by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the expression quantities of TLR4 and NF-kappa B in nasal mucosa were determined by Western blotting (WB). Results: Behavioral scores, the mRNA and protein expression of TLR4 and NF-kappa B in the nasal mucosa of the model group were significantly higher than those in the normal group (P<0.05). HE staining showed that the nasal mucosa of rats in the model group was destroyed obviously, a large number of eosinophils and other inflammatory cells infiltrated. After treatment, behavioral scores, mRNA and protein expression quantities of TLR4 and NF-kappa B in the fluticasone propionate group, the raw white mustard seed plaster group and the fried white mustard seed plaster group were significantly lower than those in the model group (P<0.05). HE staining showed that inflammatory cell infiltration was significantly decreased, and the curative effect was more significant in the raw white mustard seed plaster group than in the fluticasone propionate group or the fried white mustard seed plaster group (P<0.05), but there was no significant difference between the fried white mustard seed plaster group and the fluticasone propionate group (P<0.05). Conclusion: The acupoint application can reduce the expression of TLR4 and NF-kappa B mRNA and proteins and relieve nasal inflammatory symptoms through regulating the TLR-NF-kappa B signaling pathway in nasal mucosa of rats, thus treating allergic rhinitis (AR). besides, the effects of raw white mustard seed plaster are more significant than fried white mustard seed plaster.","[Jin Yu-Tong; Zhu Zheng-Yang; Wu Ling-Tao] Zhejiang Chinese Med Univ, 548 Binwen Rd, Hangzhou 310053, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chen Shan; Xuan Li-Hua] Zhejiang Chinese Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Hangzhou 310006, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Xuan, LH (corresponding author), Zhejiang Chinese Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Hangzhou 310006, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",xlh1083@163.com,,,key science and technology projects of Zhejiang Province [2014C03046-2],Supported by The key science and technology projects of Zhejiang Province (No. 2014C03046-2),,19,1,1,1,15,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1461.0,1467,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_222,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700044,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: Clinical data of 40 patients with SLE managed in Zhangye People's Hospital from April 2015 to November 2016 were analyzed, but with particular attention to features of their ECGs. Results: Twenty three cases (57.5%) of the 40 patients with SLE had clinical symptoms of heart injury. The average time the SLE patients with heart injury had been suffering from the disease before admission into the hospital was significantly (p < 0.05) longer than that of non-heart injury patients. There were 15 cases (37.5%) with abnormal ECG, 12 cases (30.0%) with ST-T change, 8 cases (20.0%) with arrhythmia, and 5 cases (12.5%) with low limb lead voltage. There were 2 cases of death out of the 40 patients, consisting of one male and one female. The cause of death in one of them was heart failure, while the other death was due to uremia with acute pulmonary edema. Conclusion: Changes in ECG of SLE patients is common and should be an important parameter that physicians should routinely examine for SLE cases with heart injury, in order to achieve improved prognosis of the patients' = condition.","[Jing, Wang] Hexi Univ Gansu Prov, Zhangye Peoples Hosp, Dept Dermatol, Zhangye 734000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Ling, Tang] Hexi Univ Gansu Prov, Zhangye Peoples Hosp, Dept Funct, Zhangye, Gansu, Peoples R China","Jing, W (corresponding author), Hexi Univ Gansu Prov, Zhangye Peoples Hosp, Dept Dermatol, Zhangye 734000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",dp1321@163.com,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,4.0,,,,,1151.0,1154,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4_177,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ1AT,WOS:000434986500040,,,,,2022-07-14

In our study, we retrospectively reviewed 357 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who applied to our hospital between 2009 and 2016. Materials and methods: Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was applied to the patients before surgery. The ratio of neutrophil/lymphocyte (NLR) and platelet/lymphocyte (PLR) were examined at the diagnosis in relation to pathological response and surveillance. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for estimating the survival function from lifetime data. In addition, Cox regression model was also used to explore the relationship between the survival of a patient and several explanatory variables. Results: As the tumor diameter increases, the NLR increases, p value is < 0.01 and statistically significant. NLRs were not different between the tumors of T1 and T2, but for T3 and T4 tumors it was higher and more different than others (T3 = 7.0186, T4 = 12.4391). NLR was higher in patients with surgical border continuity, p = 0.01 and statistically significant. A decrease of 1 unit of NLR would increase the likelihood of a pathological good response (1/0.962) by 1.04 fold. PLR, however, is not statistically significant; it has been observed that a decrease in the 1-unit PLR tends to increase the likelihood of a good response (1/0.996) in the pathological stage by 1.004 fold. While the patients who received partial response to the treatment were living at 59 months, the patients who received good response were living at 71 months. Although p value was 0.383, a 12-month median difference in life expectancy was significant. Conclusion: It has been shown that high NLR in colorectal cancer and many other cancers is a negative prognostic factor. However, there are few articles evaluating the NLR and PLR only for rectum cancer. As in other cancers, a high PLR is associated with a pathological response in rectal cancer and poor prognosis.","[Karaca, Feryal] Hlth Sci Univ, Adana Numune Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Radiat Oncol, Adana, Turkey; [Afsar, Cigdem Usul] Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar Univ, Dept Internal Med & Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey","Afsar, CU (corresponding author), Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar Univ, Acibadem Bakirkoy Hosp, Dept Internal Med & Med Oncol, Zeytinlik Mah Halit Ziya Usakligil Cad 1, TR-34140 Istanbul, Turkey.",cigdemusul@yahoo.com,"Afsar, Cigdem Usul/C-3436-2015; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/AAA-6103-2021","Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639",,,,17,0,0,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1383.0,1390,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_211,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700033,,,,,2022-07-14

Therefore, it is important to determine the status of the Iranian Maternal Mortality Surveillance System (IMMSS) to identify its pros and cons and to try to improve its quality; this is the aim of this study. Methods: Using the content analysis approach, this qualitative study was conducted in 2016. It had two stages: the review of all related documents and the interviews of 15 key informants. The data were analyzed through framework analysis and the results were presented using a descriptive method. Results: The implementation of various programs, interventions to improve maternal health and the achievement of the MDG 5 were found to be the most important strengths of the IMMSS. There are several weaknesses in the system, including a lack of clear information about morbidities caused by pregnancy and birth, repeated maternal deaths due to similar causes and the lack of a system evaluation at the provincial level. Conclusions: We found that the IMMSS is useful. However, certain measures are recommended to improve the system performance quality. These are, for example, the establishment of a system for the surveillance of maternal morbidities and high-risk mothers, and the evaluation of a maternal mortality surveillance system at the provincial level.","[Karimi, Afsaneh] Iran Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth Management & Informat Sci, Hlth Informat Management Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Sadoughi, Farahnaz] Iran Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth Management & Informat Sci, Hlth Management & Econ Res Ctr, 6 Rashidi Yasemi St,Vali E Ast St Vanak Sq, Tehran, Iran; [Majdzadeh, Reza] Tehran Univ Med Sci, KURC, Tehran, Iran; [Majdzadeh, Reza] Tehran Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Tehran, Iran","Sadoughi, F (corresponding author), Iran Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth Management & Informat Sci, Hlth Management & Econ Res Ctr, 6 Rashidi Yasemi St,Vali E Ast St Vanak Sq, Tehran, Iran.",,"Karimi, Afsaneh/J-9367-2017; sadoughi, farahnaz/B-7605-2018","Karimi, Afsaneh/0000-0003-3728-4513; sadoughi, farahnaz/0000-0002-7452-0864",Iran University of Medical Sciences [IUMS/SHMIS-2015/18],This study was part of a PhD thesis supported by the Iran University of Medical Sciences (IUMS/SHMIS-2015/18).

Copeptin is a glycopeptide derived from a pre-pro-hormone, which directly mirrors AVP levels. Copeptin has been shown to be elevated in various infectious and noninfectious diseases, and in acute pancreatitis. The present study aimed to examine copeptin in mild acute pancreatitis patients and to investigate it as a severity index. Materials and methods: This prospective study included 32 patients admitted to the hospital with mild acute pancreatitis, and 30 healthy volunteers. Independent sample t test and Pearson's correlation test were used for statistical evaluation. Results: Serum copeptin level was 0.539 +/- 0.076 ng/mL in mild acute pancreatitis patients and was not statistically significantly different than the control group (0.544 +/- 0.061 ng/mL). On correlation analysis serum copeptin level was not associated with the known prognosis factors. Conclusion: Previous studies have found that copeptin may be used as a prognostic factor, but our study could not find an increase in mild acute pancreatitis patients or a correlation between copeptin level and other known prognostic factors. Further studies are needed to use copeptin in diagnosis or prognosis prediction in acute pancreatitis.","[Koseoglu, Huseyin] Ankara Ataturk Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Bilkent, Turkey; [Alisik, Murat] Ankara Ataturk Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Clin Biochem, Bilkent, Turkey; [Solakoglu, Tevfik] Corlu State Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Corlu, Turkey; [Tahtaci, Mustafa; Ersoy, Osman] Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Dept Gastroenterol, Fac Med, Ankara, Turkey; [Erel, Ozcan] Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Dept Clin Biochem, Fac Med, Ankara, Turkey","Koseoglu, H (corresponding author), Univ Mh Bilkent, Ataturk Egitim & Arastirma Hastanesi, Ankara Ataturk Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Cad 1, Bilkent, Turkey.",huseyinko@yahoo.com,"Ertan, Asli/AAE-6201-2021; Alisik, Murat/O-6114-2019; EREL, Ozcan/U-1008-2019; koseoglu, huseyin/A-2449-2017","Alisik, Murat/0000-0003-0434-3206; EREL, Ozcan/0000-0002-2996-3236; ",,,,20,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1327.0,1330,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_203,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700025,,,,,2022-07-14

The aim of this study was to assess olfactory function in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR), non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) and mixed rhinitis (MR). Materials and methods: A total of 122 patients with AR, NAR, and MR were included in the study. Sniffin' Sticks test was applied to all groups. The study groups were compared in terms of odor scores and an association between olfactory dysfunction and rhinitis grading, according to ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma) criteria, was also investigated. Results: A significant difference was observed between NAR patients and the two other study groups with respect to all odor scores. TDI (Threshold, Discrimination, Identification) score, for overall olfactory function, resulted significantly lower in NAR patients than that in the other two groups (P=0.038). Conversely, no significant difference was observed between patients with AR and MR. Consistent with ARIA classification, NAR patients suffered mostly from persistent symptoms, whereas, AR patients generally suffered by intermittent symptoms, as well as MR patients, but this last with a significative higher presence of patients with persistent symptoms, when compared to AR group (P<0.05). A significative association was also observed between lower TDI scores and presence of persistent rhinitis symptomatology (P<0.001). Conclusions: Impaired olfaction is a feature more evident in NAR patients when compared to the other rhinitis subtype and it was much more affected by longer duration of rhinitis symptomatology rather than severity.","[La Mantia, Ignazio; Castro, Veronica] Univ Catania, Dept Med Sci Surg & Adv Technol, Catania, Italy; [Cupido, Francesco] Univ Palermo, Dept Surg & Oncol Disciplines, Palermo, Italy; [Andaloro, Claudio] Santa Marta & Santa Venera Hosp, Ear Nose & Throat Unit, Catania, Italy","La Mantia, I (corresponding author), Dept Med Sci Surg & Adv Technol, Via Santa Sofia 78, I-95123 Catania, Italy.",,"Andaloro, Claudio/J-7079-2019","Andaloro, Claudio/0000-0003-0274-6247",,,,29,6,6,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,525.0,529,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_84,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400037,,,,,2022-07-14

In the lastfew decades, the related studies were mainly focused on using liposome as the carrier of small molecule chemical drugs. In recent years, with the continuous development of biopharmaceutical technology, the studies on using liposome as the carrier of the protein drugs are constantly deepened. The application of protein drugs in clinical diagnosis or treatment shall take account of two aspects, namely whether there are sufficient drugs for the organism to intake and use, and the second aspects is whether the protein drug delivery is targeted and efficient. Based on this, this paper probed into the previous studies that were carried out in recent years on the liposomes for encapsulating protein drugs. Hence, this study summarized the characteristics of liposome from different preparation methods, and explored the goodpreparation methods to improve the drug entrapment efficiency as well as the excellentdetection method. Thus, this investigation is providing the theoretical basis up to some extent for the industrial production of protein drug liposomes.","[Lan, Lixin; Zhou, Quan; Yang, Xiaohui] Hunan Chem Vocat Technol Coll, Dept Pharmaceut & Biol Engn, Zhuzhou 412004, Peoples R China","Lan, LX (corresponding author), Hunan Chem Vocat Technol Coll, Dept Pharmaceut & Biol Engn, Zhuzhou 412004, Peoples R China.",hnhyllx@126.com,,,,,,12,0,0,5,20,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,1.0,,227.0,231,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_1s_37,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AM,WOS:000424879100002,,,,,2022-07-14

This study aims to observe the presence of the IRS-PI3K/AKT-Nrf2/ARE complex pathway in pancreatic B cells. Materials and methods: A rat model of type 2 diabetes was developed, and the rats were fed a high-sugar, high-fat diet supplemented with 1% tBHQ, an activator of the Nrf2/ARE pathway, for 8 weeks. Then, various indicators of oxidative stress and inflammatory response were measured in the serum and pancreatic tissues, and the fluorescence and protein expressions of Nrf2, IRS-2, pIRS-2, AKT and p-AKT in the islet cells were determined. Results: Oxidative stress and inflammation of the pancreatic B cells decreased the protein expressions of Nrf2, IRS-2, p-IRS-2, AKT, and p-AKT, and interfered with signal transduction in the IRS-PI3K/AKT-Nrf2/ARE pathway. Activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway increased the expressions of the above proteins by increasing anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory responses and promoting signal transduction in the IRS-PI3K/AKT pathway. Conclusions: There may exist a complex IRS-PI3K/AKT-Nrf2/ARE pathway for signal transduction in pancreatic B cells.

Methods: Venous blood was collected from 9 patients with IgA mesangio-proliferative glomerulonephritis (IgA nephropathy), 18 patients with non-IgA mesangio-proliferative glomerulonephritis (non-IgA MsPGN), 7 patients with membranous nephropathy (MN), 6 patients with focal segmental sclerosing glomerulonephritis (FSGS), 14 patients with chronic renal failure, and 20 healthy people. Serum IFN-gamma and IL-10 were assayed by double antibody sandwich ELISA, and 24-h urinary protein and serum creatinine excretion were measured using turbidimetry and picric acid colorimetry, respectively. Results: There were significant elevations in blood levels of IFN-gamma in patients with IgA nephropathy and non-IgA MsPGN, but the levels of IFN-gamma in patients with MN were decreased. The IFN-gamma of non-IgA MsPGN patients was positively correlated with 24 h urinary protein excretion. The levels of IL-10 in patients with IgA nephropathy, non-IgA MsPGN, FSGC and CRF were significantly decreased. In CRF patients, IL-10 was negatively associated with serum creatinine. Conclusion: Serum IFN-gamma plays a role in the improvement of immunologic injury in mesangio-proliferative glomerulonephritis which is related to development of proteinuria. The occurrence and development of CGN and CRF are closely linked to decreases in IL-10 levels.

Methods: A total of 110 patients with ischemic stroke (Stroke group) were divided into two groups according to the MoCA scale at 3 months after attack, i.e. the cognitive dysfunction (n=53) and normal cognition group (n=57); at the same time, 50 subjects who attended the physical examination were enrolled in the control group. General data of patients were collected from patients, including gender, age, education years, disease history and biochemical indexes, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was carried out to detect the levels of VILIP-1 in and immuno-scatter turbidmetry to detect the levels of hs-CRP in serum of all groups. Results: In 110 stroke patients, there were 53 with cognitive dysfunction (48.18%). In the stroke group, the level of VILIP-1 was higher than that in the control group [(449.20 +/- 100.77) ng.L-1 vs. (332.78 +/- 92.13) ng.L-1; t=6.95, p<0.001].

Significant increases were identified in HIHSS score and hs-CRP in the cognitive dysfunction group in comparison with the levels of normal cognition group, and the difference had statistical significance (p<0.01), suggesting that the level of hs-CRP goes up against the severity in cognitive dysfunction with aggravation in nerve functions. Conclusion: After stroke, VILIP-1 is increased in patients with cognitive dysfunction, suggesting that it can serve as a predictor for cognitive dysfunction after stroke; hypertension and the level of VILIP-1 in serum are independent risk factors of cognitive dysfunction after stroke, indicative of the importance of antihypertensive therapy. In light of the close correlation between hs-CRP and cognitive dysfunction after. stroke, it can be used to evaluate the severity of cognitive dysfunction of patients.","[Li, Yang] Nanjing Forest Police Coll, Sch Management, Psychol Ctr, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xiu-Qin] Nanjing Univ Chinese Med, Hanlin Coll, Nanjing 225300, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Fan, Qi; Wang, Fu-Shun; Li, Jian-Zhong] Nanjing Univ Chinese Med, Sch Psychol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yang, Qing] Hosp Jilin Univ, Blood Transfus Dept 2, 71 Xinmin St, Changchun 30000 1, Jilin, Peoples R China","Yang, Q (corresponding author), Hosp Jilin Univ, Blood Transfus Dept 2, 71 Xinmin St, Changchun 30000 1, Jilin, Peoples R China.",13844056540@163.com,,,"science foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20151565]; postdoctoral science research, dominant discipline of Jiangsu Province (integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine of NJUTCM) [2014-2017:145189]","project supported by science foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20151565); project supported by postdoctoral science research, dominant discipline of Jiangsu Province (integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine of NJUTCM) (2014-2017:145189)",,17,1,1,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1895.0,1899,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_294,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400045,,,,,2022-07-14

There are more than 2 million new stroke patients every year, more than 1.8 million deaths from stroke each year, and a 75% disability rate among survivors. After hospital treatment, transitional care could help ensure improved patient care and outcomes and reduce medical costs and readmission rates. Nevertheless, the intervention effect of transitional care on the functional exercise compliance and health status of stroke patients has not been reported in mainland China. Objectives: To examine the effectiveness of a nurse-led transitional care model on the functional exercise compliance and health status of Chinese stroke patients. Methods: The sample comprised 40 Chinese stroke patients. The intervention group (n = 20) received one month of nurse-led transitional care intervention, which included discharge assessment and a personalized transitional care plan and health education for the patients based on the results of the assessment, followed by 1 month of individual guidance (home visits and telephone follow-up). The control group (n = 20) received routine instructions at discharge, including instructions on functional exercise, daily care, dietary guidance, psychological care, and medication guidance. Functional exercise compliance and health status were monitored in both groups before the intervention and one, three, and six months after the end of transitional care to evaluate the intervention out-comes. Results: No significant between-group differences were observed in functional exercise compliance or health status before the intervention was conducted. One month after the intervention, functional exercise compliance and health status were significantly improved in the intervention group, with significant between-group differences in all but one dimension: social functioning. Three months after the intervention, functional exercise compliance and four dimensions of health status - physical functioning (PF), role limitations due to physical health problems (RP), general health perceptions (GH), and mental health (MH) - were significantly improved in the intervention group compared with the control group. Six months after the intervention, only the active advice-seeking of functional exercise compliance and the GH of health status were significantly improved in the intervention group compared with the control group. Conclusion: A nurse-led transitional care intervention effectively improved the early functional exercise compliance and health status of stroke patients. However, the intervention effect decreased with time after the intervention, and the long-term effect was not ideal.","[Liu, Lamei] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Nursing, Dept Clin Teaching & Res, 100 Sci Ave, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China","Liu, LM (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Nursing, Dept Clin Teaching & Res, 100 Sci Ave, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China.",,,,Henan Province Medical and Academic Technological Leaders Overseas Training Program [2011027]; Zhengzhou University School of Nursing Emerging Nursing Discipline Priority Program,"This research was financially supported by the Henan Province Medical and Academic Technological Leaders Overseas Training Program (2011027) and the Zhengzhou University School of Nursing Emerging Nursing Discipline Priority Program, which the authors greatly appreciate.",,35,0,0,5,16,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,4.0,,,,,959.0,965,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4_146,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ1AT,WOS:000434986500009,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: For 55 patients who received the liver transplantation, EN (n=27, Group EN) or parenteral nutrition (n=28, Group PN) was respectively provided for nutrition support within 48 h after operation. The levels of indicators, like serum albumin (ALB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartic transaminase (AST), prealbumin (PA), lymphocyte count (LC) and total bilirubin (TBIL), were measured at 1st and 9th days after operation, and the results were compared between two groups. Besides, we also compared the incidence of infection, mechanical ventilation duration, length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) and postoperative length of stay in hospital within 2 weeks after operation between the two groups. Results: Differences in comparison of the laboratory indicators at the 1st day after operation showed no statistical significance (p>0.05), but when it came to the 9th day after operation, the levels of ALB, PA and LC in Group EN were significantly higher than those in the Group PN (p<0.05); comparisons of the remaining indicators between the two groups showed that the differences had no statistical significance, but were significantly decreased when compared with the levels at the 1st day after operation. Within 2 weeks after operation, the incidence rate of infection in the group EN was significantly lower than that in the Group PN (p<0.05), and the levels of IgA and IgM in the Group EN were higher than those in the Group PN (p<0.05). Comparisons of the mechanical ventilation duration and length of stay in ICU also showed that the differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). However, after operation, the length of stay in hospital in the Group EN was significantly shorter than that in the Group PN (p<0.05). Conclusion: EN support should be provided for patients who received the liver transplantation as early as possible, which can effectively improve the nutrition status and immunological function of patients, and significantly reduce the incidence rate, thus accelerating the postoperative recovery.","[Liu, Qi-yu] Kunming Med Univ, Peoples Hosp Kunming 1, Ganmei Affiliated Hosp, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Li, Jian-feng] First Peoples Hosp Wenling, Dept Gen Surg, Taizhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Liang, X (corresponding author), JiangSu Collge Nursing, Dept Special Nursing, 9 Ave Sci & Technol, Huaian, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",liangxun_w@126.com,,,,,,16,3,2,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,859.0,863,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_131,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000035,,,,,2022-07-14

In addition, it was reported that N-(4-(2-pyridyl)(1,3-thiazol-2-yl))-2-(2,4,6-trimethylphenoxy) acetamide (CPN-9) played a pivotal role in oxidative stress-induced cell death by activating the Nrf2/ARE pathway. Therefore, it was of significance to investigate on mechanism of CPN-9 resisting xanthurenic acid-induced cytotoxicity. Cells used in this research were isolated from rabbit nucleus pulposus, analyzed by the growth curve and staining identifications. Hematoxylin eosin staining, toluidine blue, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent staining were performed to observe the cellular morphology. Furthermore, cell proliferative and apoptosis activities were detected by CCK-8 methods and AV-PI double-staining, respectively. Simultaneously, the expressions of Nrf2, ATF3, HO-1 and NQO1 were measured by western blot in this investigation. By analysis of growth curve plotting, cells isolated from nucleus pulposus growed in pattern of S in 1-5 generation. Staining observations revealed that nucleus pulposus cells were not only triangular, polygonal and short spindle shaped, but also cell nucleus was relatively large. The CCK-8 research demonstrated that xanthurenic acid had adverse effects on cell proliferative activity. Simultaneously, CPN-9(<= 40 mu M) resisted the impairments induced by xanthurenic acid and exerted protective effect on proliferative activity, consistent with the apoptosis results. Furtherly, the expressions of Nrf2, ATF3, HO-1 and NQO1 were elevated by injection of CPN-9.

Despite tremendous progress in diagnosis and traditional treatment, the prognosis of patients, especially locally advanced or muscle-invasive bladder cancer remains poor. Currently many molecular biomarkers are considered to be assoisated with the occurrence of bladder cancer. The Speckle-type POZ protein, SPOP, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor, and it is found to inhibit oncogenic signaling in other cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms in bladder cancer are less reported. Methods: In this study, we characterized the expression of SPOP in 46 pairs of bladder cancer tissues and adjacent tissues by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. The relationship between SPOP expression and clinicalpathologic factors was analyzed. Transfected bladder cancer cell lines T24 were used in cell viability, migration and wound healing assays to investigate the role of tumor suppression mechanism. Results: Immunohistochemical staining of SPOP can be detected in bladder cancer tissues but much less than adjacent bladder tissues (P < 0.01). High SPOP expression is negatively correlated with lymph node metastasis, poor histological differentiation, and tumor malignancy according to TAM staging. In vitro inhibition of SPOP markedly promoted cell viability, migration and invasion in vitro in bladder cancer cell lines. Likewise, overexpression of SPOP inhibited cell viability; migration and proliferation. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that SPOP might act as a tumor suppressor and may have potential use as novel biomarker of bladder cancer, and can provide an alternative strategy for developing therapeutic agents of bladder cancer in future.","[Ma Junhong; Li Shengwen] Tsinghua Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Urol, 6 Jiuxianqiao 1St, Beijing 100016, Peoples R China","Ma, JH (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Urol, 6 Jiuxianqiao 1St, Beijing 100016, Peoples R China.",majh_1@163.com,,,,,,30,0,0,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1981.0,1990,,,,10,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400060,,,,,2022-07-14

Conclusion: a) A high clinical pregnancy rate can be attained in IUI for those whose ratio of normal sperm is not less than 6%; b) IUI requires that seminal fluid should contain at least 10x106 sperms in total motile spermatozoa number, and the inseminations before and after ovulation are similar in importance.","[Mai, Xuan-cheng; Ding, Lei; Xu, Yong-fang; Ceng, Peng; Tao, Dan] First Peoples Hosp Yunnan Prov, Dept Reprod Med, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Tao, D (corresponding author), Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Environm Sci & Engn, Dept Ophthalmol, Kunming Childrens Hosp, 288 Qian Xing Rd, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",taodan1975@163.com,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,883.0,887,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_135,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000039,,,,,2022-07-14

In addition, periodontal disease is seen in the elderly population. The loss of bone structures is a common feature of both diseases. The aim of this study is an evaluation of the relationship between osteoporosis and periodontal disease. Material and methods: The cross-sectional study was done in 2016 in 78 patients who referred to a bone densitometry center of the Golestan hospital in Ahwaz-Iran. Patients divided into three study groups include healthy, osteopenic and osteoporotic (each group consists of 26 patients). Dual X-ray Absorption was used for evaluation of osteoporosis and for evaluation of dental criteria, five factors include number of teeth, periodontal pocket depth, clinical attachment loss, place Index and bleeding on probing were determined. For Comparison SPSS software, ANOVA, and chi-square (x(2)) was used. Results: Mean age of patients was 49.31 +/- 12.78 include 15 men and 63 women. According to results, number of teeth (p<0.01), periodontal pocket depth (p=0.000) and clinical attachment loss (p=0.001) have a significant relationship with osteoporosis while a significant relationship between bleeding on probing and osteoporosis is not observed. Conclusion: Results indicate that osteoporosis is not the causative agent of periodontal disease. However, due to its impact on clinical attachment loss it can be considered as a risk factor for periodontal disease.","[Jahangirnejad, M.] Ahvaz Jundishapur Univ Med Sci, Dept Periodontol, Ahvaz, Iran; [Mandegari, M.] Ahvaz Jundishapur Univ Med Sci, Res Comm, Ahvaz, Iran; [Rajaei, E.] Ahvaz Jundishapur Univ Med Sci, Dept Rheumatol, Ahvaz, Iran; [Nokhostin, F.] Ahvaz Jundishapur Univ Med Sci, Internal Med, Ahvaz, Iran; [Mal-Amir, Dargahi M.] Ahvaz Jundishapur Univ Med Sci, Internal Dept, Pulmonol, Ahvaz, Iran","Rajaei, E (corresponding author), Ahvaz Jundishapur Univ Med Sci, Dept Rheumatol, Ahvaz, Iran.",elhamrj@gmail.com,"Rajaei, Elham/AAD-1682-2020","Dargahi-Malamir, Mehrdad/0000-0002-4449-3359",,,,30,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1289.0,1293,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_198,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700020,,,,,2022-07-14

It is a complex of tangible and intangible characters distinct from one another - neural infrastructure, awareness, temporality, qualitative subjectivity, intentionality - to such an extent as to seem welded faces of the same prism. Consciousness is not a simple function of the mind, but its organization. In this paper we intend to show how its order is not strictly hierarchical, but sustained by multiple horizontal levels, each of which in a structural and functional continuum with several emerging phenomena. The same distinction between quantitative aspects (surveillance) and qualitative (content of consciousness) of consciousness is founded on the premise that the supervision is regulated by widespread in projection systems of the brain stem, hypothalamus and thalamus; while the content of consciousness depends on the cortical activity, and particularly from the associative areas of the cortex connected between them. The so-called disturbances of consciousness (vegetative state, the minimally conscious state, a coma, the Locked in syndrome) suggests the existence of an alteration of a common underlying system. Although the current heterogeneity of the data makes it impossible to attribute with certainty whether positive or negative about the alleged absence of consciousness in the individual patient, the search is deriving significant benefits from the accumulation of neuroimaging evidence in paintings like coma, general anesthesia, sleep, epilepsy and somnambulism. In this sense, it seems increasingly urgent a deeper understanding of the neural correlates during sleep or general anesthesia, as well as the relationships between neural processes and altered states of consciousness generated by pharmacological manipulations.","[Maldonato, Mauro N.; Iennaco, Daniela] Univ Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy; [Sperandeo, Raffaele] SIPGI Scuola Specializzaz Psicoterapia Gestalt In, Genoa, Italy; [Maldonato, Mauro N.; Sperandeo, Raffaele; Dell'Orco, Silvia] Univ Basilicata, Potenza, Italy; [Cerroni, Francesco; Romano, Palmira] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Mental Hlth Phys & Prevent Med, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Naples, Italy; [Marotta, Rosa] Magna Graecia Univ Catanzaro, Dept Hlth Sci, Catanzaro, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita; Maltese, Agata; Roccella, Michele; Parisi, Lucia; Tripi, Gabriele] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol & Pedag Sci, Child Neuropsychiat, Palermo, Italy; [Moscatelli, Fiorenzo; Sessa, Francesco; Monica, Salerno; Cibelli, Giuseppe; Messina, Giovanni; Valenzano, Anna] Univ Foggia, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Foggia, Italy; [Monda, Marcellino; Chieffi, Sergio; Villano, Ines; Monda, Vincenzo; Messina, Antonietta] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Expt Med, Sect Human Physiol, Naples, Italy; [Monda, Marcellino; Chieffi, Sergio; Villano, Ines; Monda, Vincenzo; Messina, Antonietta] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Unit Dietet & Sports Med, Naples, Italy; [Ruberto, Maria] Ctr CRD, Naples, Italy; [Marsala, Gabriella] Azienda Osped Univ, Struttura Complessa Farm, Foggia, Italy","Valenzano, A (corresponding author), Univ Foggia, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Foggia, Italy.",anna.valenzano@unifg.it,"Sessa, Francesco/G-1754-2018; Messina, Giovanni/AAE-8668-2022; Cibelli, Giuseppe/AAC-2635-2019; Messina, Antonietta/AHH-2383-2022; Moscatelli, Fiorenzo/ABC-9536-2020; MALDONATO, NELSON MAURO/AAG-3791-2021; Marotta, Rosa/AAG-1453-2020; MESSINA, ANTONIETTA/K-9366-2016","Sessa, Francesco/0000-0003-0357-8791; Messina, Giovanni/0000-0002-0011-867X; Messina, Antonietta/0000-0001-8343-432X; MALDONATO, NELSON MAURO/0000-0002-6401-2305; Sperandeo, Raffaele/0000-0002-8892-179X; VILLANO, INES/0000-0002-1755-358X; TRIPI, Gabriele/0000-0001-7088-9325; Moscatelli, Fiorenzo/0000-0003-1274-0332; Monda, Vincenzo/0000-0002-6083-5814; Cerroni, Francesco/0000-0003-3024-5482; CIBELLI, GIUSEPPE/0000-0002-5371-2584; Monda, Marcellino/0000-0002-7184-218X",,,,94,25,25,0,31,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,357.0,366,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_56,,10,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400010,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: Twenty-eight pathological gamblers completed the FT protocol consisted in 16 sessions, two times a week for a total duration of two months, in an individual setting. No one of the patients was taking any psychopharmacological therapy. Psychological assessment both at baseline (T0) and at the end of the treament (T1) includes the South Oaks Gambling Screen, the PG-Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (PG-YBOCS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Beck Depression Inventory II version (BDI-II), the Barrat Impulsiveness Scale 11th version (BIS-11) and the Measurement of Psychological Stress (MSP). Results: a significant reduction of GD (gambling frequency, duration, money inserted, and expenditure) in pathological gamblers was revealed together with a significant reduction of depression, anxiety, impulsivity and perceived stress. Conclusions: the structured FT program for GD highlights a strong improvement in gambling behavior, in reducing impulsivity, depression, anxiety and perceived stress, thus obtaining a good compliance and a few dropout.","[Maniaci, Giuseppe; La Cascia, Caterina; Ferraro, Laura; Sideli, Lucia; Seminerio, Fabio; Scaglione, Alessandra; La Barbera, Daniele] Univ Palermo, Dept Expt Biomed & Clin Neurosci, Palermo, Italy; [Picone, Francesca] ASP Palermo, Dept Pathol Addict, Palermo, Italy; [Cannizzaro, Carla] Giuseppe DAlessandro Univ Palermo, Dept Sci Hlth Promot & Mother & Child Care, Palermo, Italy","Maniaci, G (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Expt Biomed & Clin Neurosci, Palermo, Italy.",giuseppemaniaci@icloud.com,"Ferraro, Laura/AAG-3724-2020; La Cascia, Caterina/U-7743-2017; La Barbera, Daniele/AAX-5591-2020","Ferraro, Laura/0000-0002-1205-2356; La Cascia, Caterina/0000-0002-2078-0214; La Barbera, Daniele/0000-0002-9506-4546",,,,40,5,5,0,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1447.0,1452,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_220,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700042,,,,,2022-07-14

Usually, the cause is a physical, chemical, or mechanical injury; other times no apparent cause can be identified that could justify the disease. Aspecific continuing pain is the symptomatology, which is not specific and appears disproportionate to any inciting the initial traumatic event. Case presentation: A 36-year-old woman with a history of dysphagia, heartburn, abdominal pain and persistent cough underwent to EGDS with the suspect of a hiatal hernia. During the induction phase of anesthesia by intravenous administration of Propofol, an intravenous anesthetic agent, the extravasation of this drug occurred in the upper right limb tissue. Ten months later further EMG/NCS showed an antalgic reduction of the voluntary recruitment pattern lacking peripheral neuropathy signs. Continuing pain disproportionate to the incidental event, allodynia, temperature asymmetry and alteration of the skin color at the right arm lacking evidence of nerve lesions, confirmed the diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome type 2. Conclusion: In case of CPRS, the forensic pathologist has to determine the cause in order to prevent a medical malpratice claim, and also it is useful to well known the clinical features to evaluate a state of permanent invalidity. Difficult diagnosis plays a crucial role in the onset of the high disability that the disease causes if it is not recognized on time. The causes of CPRS may be the consequences of a medical error (in the specific case the extravasation of an irritant substance, Propofol) and from subsequent diagnostic delay a very debilitating morbid picture can occurs. For medico-legal purposes, it becomes essential to know the syndrome, and especially to diagnose it in a short time.","[Marella, Gian Luca] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Expt Med & Surg, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Solinas, Matteo] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Diagnost Clin & Publ Hlth Med, Via Pozzo 71, I-41124 Modena, Italy; [Feola, Alessandro; Raschella, Francesco; Caggiano, Bartolo; Marsella, Luigi T.] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Biomed & Prevent, Via Montpellier 1, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Romigi, Andrea] IRCCS Neuromed, Via Atinense 18, Pozzilli, Is, Italy","Marella, GL (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Expt Med & Surg, Sect Legal Med, Via Montpellier 1, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",glmarella@gmail.com,"Romigi, Andrea/AAE-5228-2020; Feola, Alessandro/AAI-4601-2020","Romigi, Andrea/0000-0002-4505-2600; Feola, Alessandro/0000-0002-9666-2636; Marella, Gian Luca/0000-0002-1160-2061; Marsella, Luigi Tonino/0000-0002-7005-7526",,,,15,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,373.0,376,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_58,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400012,,,,,2022-07-14

The current study is carried out to compare the effects of oxytocin and chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in inducting pregnancy and ovulation in women afflicted with the polycystic ovary syndrome. Even though clomiphene is still regarded as the major treatment in patients afflicted with the polycystic ovary syndrome, the failure of ovulation in clomiphene-resistant women is considered as a significant and serious clinical topic. Materials and methods: In a prospective research, 150 infertile clomiphene-resistant patients admitted to Akbarabadi hospital in Tehran from 2015 until 2018 were parted into three groups at random and received (100 mg clomiphene-citrate + 8 units of oxytocin), (100mg clomiphene-citrate + 10000 units of HCG) and (100mg clomiphene-citrate + 8 units of oxytocin and 10000 units of HCG). The treatment progress was determined by the number and size of Mlicles imaged using Transvaginal ultrasonography. To verify ovulation, the progesterone serum concentration was estimated. The rates of biochemical pregnancy and ovulation were compared in the mentioned three groups. Results: 150 patients went through the study. There was no major difference among the groups regarding the ovulation rate or the number of follicles [p>0.05], neither was there any significant side effects observed in any groups. Conclusion: Based on the findings of the current study, it can be concluded that because there is no difference in ovulation, OT can play a role in human ovulation either separately or coactively with other ovulatory mechanisms, and that the secretion of OT may be controlled by progesterone and ovarian estradiol. Moreover, the findings suggest that in clomiphene-resistance patients, OT might perform some role in regulating luteolysis.","[Masrour, Mojgan Javedani; Azad, Zahra] Iran Univ Med Sci, Shahid Akbarabadi Hosp, Res & Clin Ctr Gynecol & Fertil, Tehran, Iran","Masrour, MJ (corresponding author), Iran Univ Med Sci, Shahid Akbarabadi Hosp, Res & Clin Ctr Gynecol & Fertil, Tehran, Iran.",javedani46@yahoo.com,,,,,,51,1,1,5,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1757.0,1763,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_269,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400020,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: The present RCT was conducted on 200 couples (240 cycle) with male-originated infertility aged 19 to 39 years at the Infertility Clinic of Shahid Akbar Abadi hospital, Tehran. The Participants were randomly allocated into two group; the natural cycle (n=115 cycle) and hormonal cycle (n=125 cycle). The hormonal group was received 4-6 mg of oral estradiol on the third day of their cycles; while controls received placebo. Transvaginal ultrasound was used for evaluation of endometrial thickness and when the thickness was reached to8 mm, embryo transfer was planned. Chemical and clinical pregnancy were considered to be the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. Results: A total of 28 cycles were cancelled in both groups; 15 cycles (8.3 percent) in the natural group and 13 cycles (7.6 percent) in the hormonal group. Inter-groups statistical analysis showed that serum levels of FSH, LH and estradiol were not statistically different between the study groups (P>0.05). On the other hand, chemical clinical pregnancy rate (hormone receiving group: 32.7% and control group: 33.3%) and clinical pregnancy rate (hormone receiving group: 34.5% and control group: 26.4%) statistically were not different between the groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: The study results showed there is not any statistical significant difference between the study groups from point of view of chemical and clinical pregnancy rate.

It is important to discriminate both from each other. Because treatment approaches are different for the each entities. But, it is not always possible to reach enough laboratory sufficiency for discriminating the two entities everywhere. Some pratical and easy formulae could help for the discrimination in such insufficient technical possibilities. Materials and method: 40 patients included in the study. The formula (RDW(Red blood cell distribution width) X RBC(Red blood cell count) X HGB(Hemoglobin))/MCV(Mean corpuscular volume) was evaluated for the discrimination of the two entities. The formula log(10) (MCH(Mean corpuscular hemoglobin) X MCHC(Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) X RDW / RBC) was also evaluated for the differentiation of these two entities. The latter formula was identified as Alparslan index''. These formulae were compared with the well known indices such as Mentzer index. Youden Index was calculated for each index for comparing the reliability and validity of the indices. Results: The study showed no difference between the compared indices according to the sensitivity. Youden Index were found 94,73 for the Alparslan Index and 89,96 for the Mentzer Index. Discussion: There are many formulae and indices to help have an opinion for the discrimination of beta thalasemia trait from IDA(Iron deficiency anemia). Simply calculable valid formulae could be more commonly and easily used according to the complex calculation formulae. RDWI(Red Blood Cell Distribution Width Index) was found to provide more reliability than Mentzer Index in the study. In the study, Alparslan Index and RDWI were also found to provide same reliability according to Youden Index.","[Merdin, Alparslan] Univ Hlth Sci Ankara, Dr Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Oncol Training & Res Hos, Hematol Clin, Ankara, Turkey; [Merdin, Alparslan] Univ Hlth Sci Ankara, Dr Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Oncol Training & Res Hos, Bone Marrow Transplantat Unit, Ankara, Turkey","Merdin, A (corresponding author), Zerdalilik Mahallesi, Muratpasa Antalya, Turkey.",Alparslanmerdin@yahoo.com,,,,,,9,2,2,1,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,393.0,395,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_62,,3,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400016,,,,,2022-07-14

Iron is a vital nutrient that plays a role in some metabolic pathways. This study aims to determine whether there is a relationship between iron deficiency anemia and lipid profile by comparing serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in patients with IDA and healthy controls. Materials and methods: The study included 56 female patients admitted to the Internal Medicine Outpatient Unit of University of Health Sciences Ankara Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Oncology Training and Research Hospital between 15 October 2016 and 30 June 2017. All 56 patients were diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. Patients with certain diseases that may affect lipid profile such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid diseases, as well as those using medications that could affect serum cholesterol levels were not included in the study. Besides, patients with known infectious or inflammatory diseases were excluded from the study. The study also included 37 healthy women as control group. All of 37 healthy women were admitted to outpatient unit for routine tests and they had no known illnesses, either anemia or any known clinical condition that could affect their lipid levels. All of 37 healthy women and all of 56 female patients were 18-45 years old. Serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, iron, and ferritin levels, and hemogram parameters were evaluated retrospectively on the electronic patient file system. Results: The triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were compared between the two groups, and there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels (p>0.05). However, there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups with regard to total cholesterol levels (Z=-2.245; p=0.025). There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to LDL cholesterol levels (Z=-1.998; p=0.046). LDL cholesterol levels of patients with iron-deficiency anemia were found to be significantly higher than those of the control group. The mean age of the patients with iron deficiency anemia was also found to be significantly higher than that of the control group (Z=-2.925, p=0.003). Conclusion: It should be kept in mind that LDL cholesterol levels might be affected in patients with iron deficiency anemia.","[Merdin, Fatma Avci] Univ Hlth Sci Ankara, Dr Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Oncol Training & Res Hos, Internal Med Clin, Ankara, Turkey; [Merdin, Alparslan] Univ Hlth Sci Ankara, Dr Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Oncol Training & Res Hos, Hematol Clin, Ankara, Turkey; [Merdin, Alparslan] Univ Hlth Sci Ankara, Dr Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Oncol Training & Res Hos, Bone Marrow Transplantat Unit, Ankara, Turkey","Merdin, FA (corresponding author), Dr Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Oncol Educ & Res, Mehmet Akif Ersoy Mahallesi,13 Cadde,56, Ankara, Turkey.",fatma_avci.md@hotmail.com,"Ertan, Asli/AAE-6201-2021; Merdin, Alparslan/AAD-8751-2022",,,,,14,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1949.0,1952,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6303,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400054,,,,,2022-07-14

During this time, every woman must be nourished in such a way as to maintain herself in good health and at the same time allovt , the fetal tissues to form and develop in the best way. Proper nutrition is one of the fundamental prerequisites for the normal evolution of both pregnancy and fetal growth: the quantity and quality of food and drinks must be scrupulously controlled. Contrariwise, it is important to avoid the excess calories and macronutrients. In filet, during pregnancy, it may be just as harmful as their shortage, e.specially in overweight and obese women, jar which the risk of miscarriage, gestational diabetes, fetal growth disorders and preeclampsia increases. The pasta constitutes the foundation of the Mediterranean diet food. The dough can be seen, therefore, so it represents an excellent ally of the diet from a nutritional point of view. The nutritional values of the pasta change depending on the type, based on the fact that the dough is traditional or integral semolina. It also contains vitamin B and has an abundance of minerals, among which potassium. The pasta is an easily digestible food, ensuring energy ready to use (such as all carbohydrates); moreover, it possesses a great satiating power. In case of overweight, however, it is possible to reduce the number of carbohydrates in the diet, taking care not to make them ever miss. In conclusion, the consumption of pasta is very important during pregnancy: a diet without carbohydrates can be dangerous for all physiological pathways.","[Messina, Antonietta; Monda, Vincenzo; Monda, Marcellino] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Expt Med, Naples, Italy; [Picciocchi, Elisabetta; Valenzano, Anna; Cibelli, Giuseppe; Ruberto, Valentina; Pisanelli, Daniela; Di Palma, Antonella; Barone, Antonia Vanessa; Messina, Giovanni] Univ Foggia, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Foggia, Italy; [Picciocchi, Elisabetta] Casa Cura Villa Fiori Acerra, Naples, Italy; [Polito, Anna Nunzia] Osped Riuniti Foggia, Complex Struct Neuropsychiat Childhood Adolescenc, Foggia, Italy; [Marsala, Gabriella] Azienda Ospedaliero Univ, Osped Riuniti Foggia, Struttura Complessa Farm, Foggia, Italy; [Ruberto, Maria] CDR Santa Maria Pozzo, Somma Vesuviana, Italy; [Gallai, Beatrice] Univ Perugia, Dept Surg & Biomed Sci, Perugia, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] Univ Palermo, Dept PROSAMI, Palermo, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] CH Chinon, Childhood Psychiat Serv Neurodev Disorders, St Benoit La Foret, France; [Lavan, Francesco; Lavano, Serena Marianna; Marotta, Rosa] Magna Graecia Univ Catanzaro, Dept Hlth Sci, Catanzaro, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, Palermo, Italy; [Romano, Palmira] Ctr Riabilitaz LARS, Sarno, Italy; [Cerroni, Francesco] Ctr Manzoni Srl, Naples, Italy; [Russo, Daniela] Ctr Riabilitaz La Filanda LARS, Sarno, Italy; [Di Folco, Annabella; Parisi, Lucia; Testa, Davide] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Educ Sci & Human Movement, Palermo, Italy; [Doro, Lucrezia] Ctr Ambulatoriale Santo Stefano, Pesaro, Italy; [Sorrentino, Michele] NICU Preterm & High Risk Newborn Neurodev Follow, Volturno, CE, Italy; [Sorrentino, Michele] Pineta Grande Hosp Castel, Volturno, CE, Italy; [Magliulo, Rosaria Martina] Ctr Studi Scoliosi SRL, Naples, Italy","Monda, V (corresponding author), Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Expt Med, Naples, Italy.",vincenzo.monda@unicampania.it,"Messina, Antonietta/AHH-2383-2022; Cibelli, Giuseppe/AAC-2635-2019; Marotta, Rosa/AAG-1453-2020; Messina, Giovanni/AAE-8668-2022; MESSINA, ANTONIETTA/K-9366-2016","Messina, Antonietta/0000-0001-8343-432X; Messina, Giovanni/0000-0002-0011-867X; Monda, Marcellino/0000-0002-7184-218X; Monda, Vincenzo/0000-0002-6083-5814; CIBELLI, GIUSEPPE/0000-0002-5371-2584; Cerroni, Francesco/0000-0003-3024-5482; Marotta, Rosa/0000-0003-0515-5952",Pastificio Di Martino Gaetano F. lli Spa,Thanks to Pastificio Di Martino Gaetano & F. lli Spa for non-conditioned financial support for research projects in Nutrition Physiology,,97,0,0,5,11,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,4.0,,2107.0,2114,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4s_325,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,HA4LD,WOS:000450232900005,,,,,2022-07-14

The purpose of the present study was to validate the Arabic-Tunisian version of the French CSAI-2R questionnaire and to evaluate its validity and reliability. Materials and methods: Out of an initial list of 490 subjects, participants of the present validation study were 304 Tunisian football players (81 males [26.6%]; mean age 21.58 years (SD = 2.40 years, range 16-31) of different levels (international level: 34 [11.2%]; national level: 238 [78.3%]; regional level: 32 [10.5%]) that volunteered to participate in the study. Data were collected and analyzed in terms of reliability and validity using correlations, reliability, parallel analysis and exploratory factor analysis. Results: The 2-factor solution accounted for 48%, 47% and 56% of variance for the Direction, Frequency, and Intensity scales, respectively. The 3-factor solution accounted for 60%, 57% and 64% of variance for the Direction, Frequency, and Intensity scales, respectively. Although the 3-factor solution explained an additional, substantial proportion of variance with respect to the 2-factor solution, the factor structure did not replicate well across scales. Conversely, in 2-factor solution, if items 1, 2, 15, and 16 were excluded, the pattern of loadings was exactly the same for all scales. Hence, we concluded that the 2-factor solution should be retained, as it provided a measurement model for the Arabic-Tunisian CSAI-2R items that was constant across scales. Conclusion: The Arabic-Tunisian version of the French CSAI-2R in its original version has failed to demonstrate robust and sound psychometric properties. Its reduced version represents a first attempt that can be henceforth used in the Arab world, even if further investigations should enable to improve its psychometric properties.","[Mnedla, Sofiene] Mannouba Univ, Dept Educ Sci, Higher Inst Sport & Phys Educ Ksar Said, Manouba, Tunisia; [Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi] Univ Genoa, Dept Hlth Sci DISSAL, Sch Publ Hlth, I-16132 Genoa, Italy; [Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi] Univ Genoa, IRCCS San Martino IST, Dept Neurosci DINOGMI, Sect Psychiat, Largo Rosanna Benzi 10, I-16132 Genoa, Italy; [Chiorri, Carlo] Univ Genoa, Dept Educ Sci, Genoa, Italy; [Elloumi, Ali] Univ Paris 05, Lab Tech & Enjeux Corps, Paris, France; [Briki, Walid] Qatar Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Sport Sci Program, Doha, Qatar","Mnedla, S (corresponding author), Mannouba Univ, Dept Educ Sci, Higher Inst Sport & Phys Educ Ksar Said, Manouba, Tunisia.;Mnedla, S (corresponding author), Tunis Univ, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Educ Sci, Tunis, Tunisia.",,"Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi/G-1672-2011","Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi/0000-0001-8409-868X; Briki, Walid/0000-0002-6298-811X",,,,18,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,377.0,382,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_59,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400013,,,,,2022-07-14

However, no research addresses the response of ductules cells, which harbor hepatic stem/progenitor cells, in Cr(VI) induced liver injury. The main goal of this study is to clarify the toxic effect of Cr(VI) on liver histopathological changes including hepatocellular damage and biliary ductular reaction after 3 months exposure in adult rabbits. Twenty four male and female rabbits were allotted randomly to three groups including control, low and moderate dose of Cr(VI) (fed with 0, 0.35 and 2.09 mg/kg/day Cr(VI), respectively). H&E and immunohistochemistry staining were utilized to analyze changes in the structure of the liver. Histopathological results showed that Cr(VI) exposure resulted in hepatocellular damage in a dose dependent manner. Ductular reaction was observable at the portal area as well as canal of Herings as determined by CK7 and CK19. In addition, low dose of Cr(VI) exposure generated more CK-positive cells compared to control and moderate dose of Cr(VI) exposure. Correspondingly, cholangiofibrosis was accompanied by an increase in the bile duct proliferation.

It is known that phylogenetic history, size and ecology can all promote the evolution of morphological variation; however, some methods have been recently developed to analyze these aspects for particular body structures. Spotted whip snake Hemorrhois ravergieri appears to have the widest distribution of the Hemorrhois snake genus, especially in Iran. Morphological difference resulting from habitat can occur in several populations of H. ravergieri. Some studies have studied the relation between morphology and habitat use, revealing that motion is the main facilitator of this evolutionary relationship. Now, we consider intraspecific ecomorphological in three habitat types. Geometric morphometric analyses can provide a more detailed image of head shape in three directions (dorsal, lateral and ventral) on three types of habitat: north-west of Iran, north-east of Iran and central Zagros of Iran. Adult specimens were selected and characteristics of head were analyzed, along with body and head size for understanding the proximate mechanisms, which might be involved. The morphological variation between H. ravergieri indicated that variation in size and head dimensions between species and sexes are highly significant in habitat. Males and females differed in head characters and body size; especially, males were found to exhibit a disproportionate increase in head size and dimensions. H. ravergieri from north-east and central Zagros are smaller, than those living in north-west are. The results revealed that considering the previous findings on the populations, the morphological differences were probably not caused by competition between the populations; instead, these traits could be attributed to the natural selection.","[Moshtaghie, Minoo] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Environm & Energy, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Kaboli, Mohammad] Univ Tehran, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Environm, Tehran, Iran; [Salehi, Mansour] Isfahan Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Dept Genet & Mol Biol, Esfahan, Iran","Kaboli, M (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Environm, Tehran, Iran.",mkaboli@ut.ac.ir,,,,,,41,0,0,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,2.0,,583.0,589,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2s_92,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7SD,WOS:000429274400006,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: The present study was conducted as single-blind clinical trial in Besat Hospital of Sanandaj, Iran, 2017. Ninty three male patients undergoing skeletal traction were randomly selected by using sealed envelopes with the capability of replacing the envelopes. They were then divided into three groups: sugar-free chewing gum group, abdominal massage group, and control group. After seven days of intervention, the patients' rate of incidence and severity of constipation was measured based on Rome Ill questionnaire. The data were then analyzed using Kolmogorov Smirnov test and chi-squared test using SPSS-23. Results: The incidence rate of constipation in sugar-free chewing gum group, abdominal massage group, and control group was 23.7%, 37.3%, and 39% respectively. The findings indicated that the incidence of constipation in sugar-free chewing gum group as well abdominal massage group was much less than that of the control group, and this statistical difference was significant (P=0.034). With respect to the severity of constipation, no significant difference was observed between the intervention group and control group (p=0.947).

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted for 167 prostate cancer patients who were confirmed by needle biopsy of prostate gland or postoperative pathologic examination between September 2014 and August 2017. Osseous metastasis was diagnosed through ECT, X-ray, CT/MRI or bone biopsy, and we analyzed the correlations of ALP, PSA, fPSA, fPSA/tPSA and PSAD with the osseous metastasis of prostate cancer and their diagnostic value for osseous metastasis. Results: In 183 patients, there were 114 with osseous metastasis (62.3%) and 69 with non-osseous metastasis (37.7%). In the osseous metastasis group, the levels of ALP, PSA and PSAD were significantly higher than those in the non-osseous metastasis group (p<0.01), while the difference in comparison of fPSA/tPSA between two groups showed no statistical significance (p>0.05). In patients with PSA>50 ng/m, the incidence rate of osseous metastasis was significantly higher than that in those with PSA in concentrations between 20 and 50 ng/mL, 10 and 20 ng/mL and not higher than 10 ng/mL (p<0.05); for patients with ALP larger than 90 U/L, incidence of osseous metastasis was significantly elevated in comparison with that in patients with ALP in concentration not higher than 90 U/L (p<0.05); the rate of osseous metastasis in patients with PSAD>0.4 ng/ml/cm(3) was significantly higher than that in those with PSAD <= 0.4 ng/ml/cm(3). With ALP>90 UIL, PSA>50 ng/mL and PSAD>0.4 ng/ml/cm(3) as critical values, we analyzed the predictive values of ALP, PSA, PSAD, PSA+ALP, PSA+PSAD and PSA+PSAD+ALP in diagnosis of osseous metastasis in prostate cancer, and the results revealed that combined application of these indicators is more effective for positive and negative predictions in comparison with the single indicator, and combination of PSA+PSAD+ALP showed optimal outcomes in sensitivity (100%), specificity (79.17%), positive predictive value (91.38%) and negative predictive value (100%). Conclusion: ALP, PSA and PSAD are the reliable indicators for evaluating the osseous metastasis in prostate cancer patients, while the combination of PSA, PSAD and ALP is conducive to prediction of prostate cancer. PSA<50 ng/mL, PSAD<0.4 ng/ml/cm(3) and ALP<90 U/L can help physicians to rule out the osseous metastasis.","[Ni, Zhao; OuYang, Song] Shihezi Univ Shihezi, Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Urol, Xinjiang 832008, Peoples R China; [Zhuo, Hui] 3rd Hosp Chengdu, Dept Urol, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Qing] Jilin Univ, Dept Blood Transfus, Hosp 1, Changchun 130000, Jilin, Peoples R China","Lin, W (corresponding author), Shanghai Changning Matern & Infant Hlth Inst, Androl Dept, 773 Wuyi Rd, Shanghai 200051, Peoples R China.",shlinwei123@163.com,,"Ou-Yang, Song/0000-0001-7962-2811",,,,12,0,0,0,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1815.0,1820,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_279,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400030,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: A total of 60 rats were randomly divided into three groups of 20 rats each based on their weight. Group 1 was the blank control, group 2 the model and group 3 the experimental. AD models were established by injecting A beta 25 similar to 35 into the brain of the rats in the model and experimental groups respectively. In addition, the rats in the experimental group were administered inulicin via gavage, once a day. These three groups were maintained for 21 days. After the 21 days period, immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used for proving that the production of COX-2 and iNOS proteins occured in the hippocampus of the rats, and RTPCR was used to amplify the levels of COX-2 and iNOS mRNA molecules. Results: The transcription of the mRNA molecules, and their translation into proteins, of COX-2 and iNOS in the hippocampus of the rats in the model group were significantly greater (p < 0.05) than those of the blank control group. The transcription of the mRNA molecules, and their translation into proteins, of COX-2 and iNOS in the hippocampus of the rats in the experimental group administered inulicin were significantly lower than those of the model group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Inulicin inhibits the expressions of COX-2 and iNOS genes in the hippocampus of A beta-induced Alzheimer's disease model rats. This suggests that inulicin plays anti -inflammatory role in the brain and this may be the mechanism by which it brings about amelioration in AD condition.","[Niu Xiao-Hua; Chen Hong-Yuan] Chongqing Three Gorges Med Coll, Chongqing Engn Res Ctr Antitumor Nat Drugs, Chongqing, Peoples R China","Chen, HY (corresponding author), Chongqing Baian Star Rd Wanzhou Dist 366 Dam, Chongqing 404020, Peoples R China.",tf1346@163.com,,,,,,12,0,0,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,4.0,,,,,975.0,979,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4_148,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ1AT,WOS:000434986500011,,,,,2022-07-14

There are topical, local invasion and immune therapy options for verruca vulgaris. The role of vitamin D levels in patients with verruca vulgaris is not clear. We investigated the serum vitamin D levels in patients with verruca vulgaris. Materials and methods: Fifty-five patients with verruca vulgaris (Group I) and 60 healthy controls (Group II) included in the study. The characteristics of verruca vulgaris (duration, clinical type, the number of lesions, family history) and demographics of the participants were recorded. Serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels were measured using electrochemiluminescence binding method. Results: After covariance analysis, we found no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of mean age (23.38 +/- 4.68 years in Group I versus 27.35 +/- 8.14 years in Group II). Other baseline characteristics were not significantly different between the groups (p > 0.05 for all). The mean duration of verruca vulgaris was 12 (4-18) years and the most common sites were hand (26 patients, 47.3%) and foot (23 patients, 41.8%).

There was a statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of serum vitamin D levels (p < 0.001). Conclusion: In this study, vitamin D levels in patients with verruca vulgaris were found to be decreased compared to healthy controls. Low vitamin D levels may play an etiological role in the development of verruca vulgaris.","[Oztekin, Coskun] Hitit Univ, Sch Med, Dept Family Med, Corum, Turkey; [Oztekin, Aynure] Hitit Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, Corum, Turkey; [Tastan, Kenan] Ataturk Univ, Sch Med, Dept Family Med, Erzurum, Turkey; [Ozmen, Gulsen Gul] Ali Osman Sonmez Onkol State Hosp, Dept Biochem, Bursa, Turkey; [Pektas, Suzan Demir] Mugla Sitki Kocman Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, Mugla, Turkey","Oztekin, C (corresponding author), Hitit Univ, Sch Med, Dept Family Med, Corum, Turkey.",,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,4.0,,,,,1047.0,1050,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4_160,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ1AT,WOS:000434986500023,,,,,2022-07-14

The disease leads to a wide variety of complications; among them foot ulcers are common being the most frequent cause of hospitalization of diabetic patients. Moreover, foot ulcers predict disability, morbidity, and mortality in diabetic patients in addition to incurring considerable healthcare costs. We investigate the bacteria involved in diabetic foot ulcers infection and record the evolution and epidemiological data of a group of patients. Materials and methods: The study population consisted of prospectively enrolled diabetic patients who attended two hospitals in Barcelona: one specializing in foot care (Hospital Podologic of the University of Barcelona) and the other a tertiary referral hospital (Hospital de Sant Pau). A comparison of microbiological results and their dependence on the sampling method (swab or punch) was done. Results: Diabetic Foot Syndrome was more prevalent in males than in females and more prevalent in patients with type 2 than type 1 diabetes. It becomes apparent that individuals living alone (singles, widowers and widows, etc.) tend to request medical assistance later or perhaps they take less attention to their feet, thus percentage of singles increased with the severity. Relatives and nursing care seem to play a relevant role in the evolution and prognosis of diabetic foot ulcers. Conclusion: Relatives and nursing care seem to play a crucial role in the evolution and prognosis of diabetic foot ulcers.

It is important to understand which interventions focused on the reduction of weight gained during pregnancy are the safest, and the most effective. Methods: A pilot study was carried out in a Hospital setting. Twenty-nine women were involved in the study. A healthy lifestyle promotion program for postpartum women including, visual materials of an exercise program, and physical activity and healthy diet recommendations after delivery, was designed. Women after 2 days after delivery were invited to participate in the study by following recommendations on lifestyle. After two and six month's postpartum, women were asked to come back to the Obstetrics Department for individual control (health variables), lifestyle (diet and exercise) and anthropometric measurements (body composition). Data analysis consisted of the qualitative analysis regarding the feasibility of the program, and on the quantitative analysis regarding the changes of the outcome variables from 2 to 6 months postpartum. Results: The pilot study was feasible and most of the participants were satisfied with it. The materials were built by health and exercise professionals, and were easily put in practice. The setting was appropriate, and the intervention was combined with the usual care of postpartum women in a hospital setting, supervised by a midwife. The pilot intervention resulted in positive changes in body composition (i.e., 71.1 +/- 10.8 to 62.6 +/- 10.1 kg; and significant reduction of most girths and skin folds' measurements), and physical activity level of women (12.1 +/- 1.6 to 23.5 +/- 2.5 metabolic equivalent) within 6 months after delivery. Discussion: This pilot study supports the research hypothesis that a healthy lifestyle promotion program may positively affect the changes in the body composition and physical activity level of women after childbirth.

Materials and methods: 40 clinical fecal samples of hospitalized patients in the Pediatric Clinic of Infectious Diseases - Sofia were tested, the patients aged between 0 and 7 years and with diarrheal syndrome. The clinical samples were tested using a rapid immunochromatographic test (ICT) (CerTest Biotec). All positive samples were tested for confirmation by culturing in a microaerophilic atmosphere at 42 degrees C and subsequently the isolates were biochemically differentiated. The Eva Green real-time mPCR reaction of a direct fecal sample was conducted using the IQ5TM Real-Time PCR System apparatus. Results: Out of 40 clinical fecal samples which were ICT positive, 20 strains were isolated by culture - 18 of C. jejuni and 2 of C. coli. The Eva Green real-time mPCR reaction also reported 20 positive samples for Campylobacter - 18 out of which were of C. jejuni and 2 of C. coli. All other samples were negative for Campylobacter spp. The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the mPCR method were 100%. Discussion: We developed and optimized the Eva Green real-time mPCR for detection and species differentiation of C. jejuni/coli directly from a clinical fecal sample. This analysis ensures the faster and more reliable detection of bacterial cells when compared to the conventional culture methods using biochemical differentiation.","[Pavlova, Maria; Dobreva, Elina; Asseva, Galina; Ivanov, Ivan N.; Kantardjiev, Todor] Natl Ctr Infect & Parasit Dis, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Velev, Valeri; Tomova, Ivelina] Med Univ Sofia, Dept Infect Dis & Parasitol, Sofia, Bulgaria","Velev, V (corresponding author), Med Univ Sofia, Bulv G Sofiiski 1, Sofia, Bulgaria.",,"Velev, Valeri/AAX-3241-2020","Velev, Valeri/0000-0003-0161-6993; Pavlova, Maria/0000-0003-2116-6264",,,,6,1,1,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,4.0,,,,,1027.0,1030,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4_156,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ1AT,WOS:000434986500019,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: This correlational study design was aimed at discovering correlations, if any, between the patient satisfaction with nursing care and nursing care activities. The study was performed in a Slovenian medical hospital, and variables were collected at (1) the ward level (patients cared pr on a daily basis; number of hours/patients a day), (2) nursing care level, by observing nursing activities at 10-minute intervals; and (3) at the patient level, by administering the Patient Perception of Hospital Experience with Nursing tool. Results: A total of 218 patients were involved, and their satisfaction with nursing care was high (average=4.42, Sd=0.53). On average, 80 patients were cared for per day at the unit level by ensuring around 3.6 hours of nursing care; 7,732 activities were performed by 43 nursing personnel, and only a third (n=2,842, 36.8%) of all nursing activities were performed in contact with the patient. Patient satisfaction was significantly negatively correlated with the number of patients cared for at the unit level on a daily basis (p<0.000). On the contrary, it was positively correlated (p<0.000) with the amount of care hours/patient/day, and with some direct care activities (p<0.000). Conclusions: To ensure patient satisfaction, more nurses should deal with the increased number of patients admitted in the medical units. It is recommended to increase the amount of nursing care offered by registered nurses, given that the competences acquired at the academic level can affect the environment and the caring processes and, thereby, the patients' satisfaction.","[Persolja, Melita] Univ Primorska, Nova Gorica Unit, Fac Hlth Sci, Koper, Slovenia; [Markic, Mirko] Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Koper, Slovenia; [Blatnik, Dragica] Izola Gen Hosp, Izola, Slovenia; [Palese, Alvisa] Univ Udine, Dept Med Sci, Udine, Italy","Palese, A (corresponding author), Univ Udine, Dept Med Sci, Udine, Italy.",alvisa.palese@uniud.it,"Palese, Alvisa/J-9427-2015","Palese, Alvisa/0000-0002-3508-844X","European Union under the European Social Fund; Ministry of Education, Science and Sport of the Republic of Slovenia","This research was not funded.

Today, more than ever, physical activity is particularly relevant in people's life, as it can be seen by the great number of people who registers in gyms, and by the growing importance given to wellness/fitness and the striving to physical perfection. It is known that a good perception of his own body allows the individual to positively influence his self-esteem, his self-efficacy and his mood. There are not age limitations to enroll in sport clubs and in the last twenty years many seniors have begun to enroll in sport clubs and to frequent them assiduously. Materials and methods: In the present research, we asked ourselves if for a sample of seniors, going regularly to a sport club is linked to a concept of health or to different variables We went to a prestigious Sicilian gym and we documented ourselves about the age of the people enrolled in the structure; we examined a sample of seniors frequenting the structure both on personality and self-perception variables, and on the natural predisposition to confront emergencies (digit radio). Results: The Big Five - 10 items show that the female group is more open to experience while the male sample shows higher values for consciousness and extroversion. 44% of the female sample and 52% of the male sample obtained mean self-efficacy values. Values obtained from the sample show a statistically relevant difference (P<<0,0001) between real figure and ideal figure; these values reveal that the sample is not satisfied of his body. Results obtained from the entire sample show a slight level of overweight with a BMI of 25,91 (+/- 3,5). While the ratio 2D: 4D is correlated for both groups conscientiously. Conclusion: Results leads us to observe, firstly, the growing number of seniors enrolled at the gym, secondary, that the choice to frequent a sport club is mostly linked to an aesthetic canon imposed by modern society and not to a concept of health. To the question Choice of life or life that choices? that we asked ourselves at the beginning of this work we can answer with slight bitterness that often is the life that choices. In any age, mediatic conditioning is very strong; we should continue to make physical activity with the awareness that it represents life and health for our body, becoming sometimes a true elixir of life.","[Petralia, Maria Cristina; Coco, Marinella; Basile, Maria Sofia; Perciavalle, Vincenzo; Castellano, Sabrina; Platania, Silvia] Univ Catania, Dept Biomed & Biotechnol Sci, Catania, Italy; [Petralia, Maria Cristina; Commodari, Elena; Di Nuovo, Santo; Pirrone, Concetta; Castellano, Sabrina; Perciavalle, Valentina] Univ Catania, Dept Educ Sci, Catania, Italy; [Maci, Tiziana] Alzheimer Ctr Psychogeriatry, Dept Mental Hlth ASP Catania 3, Catania, Italy; [Minissale, Chiara; De Pasquale, Concetta; D'Orto, Gianluca; Maggio, Claudio; Sehili, Amel; Coco, Lucio Salvatore Giovanni] Univ Catania, Catania, Italy; [Donato, Ezio; Maniaci, Mario] Virgin Act Catania, Catania, Italy; [Di Corrado, Donatella; Guarnera, Maria; Ramaci, Tiziana; Bellomo, Maria] Kore Univ, Dept Human & Social Sci, Enna, Italy; [Napolitano, Salvatore; Ascione, Antonio] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Phys Educ & Wellness, Naples, Italy; [Buscemi, Andrea] Horus Cooperat Social, Ragusa, Italy","Coco, M (corresponding author), Univ Catania, Dept Biomed & Biotechnol Sci, Catania, Italy.",marinella.coco@unict.it,"Di Nuovo, Santo/K-7760-2019; Basile, Maria Sofia/AAC-3393-2019; Petralia, Maria/AAE-6337-2019; Coco, Marinella/AAC-8750-2020; Platania, silvia/F-4869-2017; Di Corrado, Donatella/K-3757-2019; Di Corrado, Donatella/H-3726-2019; de pasquale, concetta/AAG-8431-2020; RAMACI, TIZIANA/AAD-3672-2019; Ascione, Antonio/I-9473-2018","Di Nuovo, Santo/0000-0001-6086-7624; Basile, Maria Sofia/0000-0002-4811-4694; Di Corrado, Donatella/0000-0001-8223-6671; de pasquale, concetta/0000-0003-4692-0980; RAMACI, TIZIANA/0000-0002-0745-2013; Platania, Silvia/0000-0002-7324-4466; Ascione, Antonio/0000-0003-4466-1807; Petralia, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-9643-1045",,,,30,16,16,2,17,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,1.0,,,,,107.0,111,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_1_18,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AH,WOS:000424878600018,,,,,2022-07-14

The aim of the study is to evaluate praxis abilities in a population of children without aural migraine. Materials and methods: The test population consists of 10 subjects without migraine without aura (MwA), (8 Males) (mean age 8.40, SD +/- 1.17) and 11 healthy children (7 Males) (mean age 8.27; SD +/- 1.10; p = 0.800). All subjects underwent evaluation of motor coordination skills through the Battery for Children Movement Assessment (MABC). Results: The two groups (10 MwA vs 11 Controls) were similar for age (8.40 +/- 1.17 vs 8.27 +/- 1.10; p = 0.800), sex (p = 0. 730), and BMI (p = 0.204). The migraine subjects show an average worse performance than the Movement ABC; specifically, migraineurs show significantly higher total score values (31.00 +/- 23.65 vs 4.72 +/- 2.61; p = 0.001), manual dexterity (12.10 +/- 11.20 vs 2.04 +/- 2.65; p = 0.009) and balance (14.85 +/- 10.08 vs. 1.04 +/- 1.05; p <0.001). The mean percentile of migraine performance is significantly reduced compared to controls (9.00 +/- 3.82 vs 51.00 +/- 24.34, p <0.001) (Table 1).

In this context, performing a regular physical activity promotes a healthy lifestyle, with significant health benefits. The aim of the study was to investigate behaviors that increase the risk of obesity and the determinants that encourage physical activity among adolescents. Materials and methods: The HBSC (Health Behavior in School-aged Children) questionnaire was administered to students in Palermo's private and public schools. For the sampling of public schools the protocol of the HBSC Surveillance System was followed; for the private ones it was opportunistic. Results: Private school students are more likely to exercise more than 3 days per week (OR 1.58) and are more likely to exercise more than 2 times a week (OR 2.08). Obese students in private schools in Palermo are more likely to perform physical activity for less than 3 days a week (OR 3.52) and a higher risk of not having breakfast (OR 10.11) and a snack between main meals (OR 3.82) every day. For all the schools examined, it emerged that obese subjects are more likely not to consume fruit (OR 3.13), to stay more than 6 hours a day in front of PCs and video games (OR 3.24) and more than 2 hours a day in front of TV (OR 3.79). Male students are more likely to perform physical activity for more than 3 days per week (OR 1.48) and intense physical activity at least 2 times per week (OR 1.76) Conclusions: It is necessary to intervene early with training on school and family in order to promote correct and responsible food choices and increase the level of physical activity among students. Therefore prevention interventions must be an integral part of coherent strategies based on tests of agreed effectiveness in order to minimize the risk linked to the development of diseases.","[Provenzano, Sandro; Santangelo, Omar Enzo; Catalano, Rosanna; Marchese, Valentina; Bonanno, Valentina; La Placa, Simona; Firenze, Alberto] Univ Study Palermo, Dept Sci Hlth Promot & Mother & Child Care GD Ale, Palermo, Italy; [La Placa, Simona] Polyclin Univ Hosp P Giaccone, Palermo, Italy; [Cernigliaro, Achille] Reg Hlth Author, Dept Hlth Serv & Epidemiol Observ, Palermo, Sicilian Region, Italy; [Mattina, Francesca] Local Hlth Unit Palermo, Dept Prevent Food Hyg Surveillance & Nutr Prevent, Palermo, Italy","Firenze, A (corresponding author), Dipartimento Sci Promoz Salute & Materno Infantil, Via Vespro 129, I-90127 Palermo, Italy.",alberto.firenze@unipa.it,"Santangelo, Omar Enzo/T-9659-2019; Cernigliaro, Achille/AAP-8092-2020","Santangelo, Omar Enzo/0000-0003-2017-3665; Provenzano, Sandro/0000-0001-7179-7246",,,,29,2,2,0,8,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,443.0,448,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_70,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400024,,,,,2022-07-14

The effect of physical activity on redox balance is extremely complex and it is influenced by age, sex, and training level, as well as by the intensity and duration of the exercise. During intense physical activity, free radicals are produced and oxidative stress is induced. In our study, we evaluated the efficacy of antioxidant supplementation and an intense physical activity program on redox homeostasis and the histopathological changes in animals with induced lymphedema, performing intense physical activity, with and without antioxidant supplementation. Methods: 50 Wistar female rats were randomized in five groups: group I: witness; group II: induced lymphedema; group III: induced lymphedema and a daily physical activity program, group IV: induced lymphedema and antioxidant supplementation; group V: induced lymphedema, a daily physical activity program and antioxidant supplementation. Results: After surgery for removal of axillary lymph nodes, right anterior limb volume of all subjects from the study increased significantly. Redox homeostasis was improved after antioxidant supplementation by the decrease of the oxidative stress. Lymphedema was significantly reduced. Histopathological examination revealed that physical activity has led to a reduction in the number of lymphatic capillaries and lymphatic vessel expansion. Antioxidant supplementation reduced significantly the inflammation and lymphatic dilatation after lymphadenectomy. Conclusions: Moderate physical activity has antioxidant effects, while intensive effort's effect is pro oxidant. Cellular redox balance is dependent on antioxidants. Antioxidant supplementation attenuates significantly the pro oxidant effect in subjects with induced lymphedema, even in subjects with intense physical activity. Reducing the oxidative stress or strengthening the antioxidative defense mechanism could supplement the complex physical therapy in chronic lymphedema.","[Puscas, Dina Magdalena; Tache, Simona] Iuliu Hatieganu Univ Med & Pharm Cluj Napoca, Dept Physiotherapy, Cluj Napoca, Romania","Puscas, DM (corresponding author), 8 Babes St, Cluj Napoca 400012, Romania.",dina.puscas@yahoo.com,,,,,,50,1,1,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1317.0,1325,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_202,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700024,,,,,2022-07-14

Method: A total of 80 treatment-free patients with lung cancer confirmed through imaging, chemical pathology diagnosis and cytology in our hospital from January 2015 to December 2016 were placed in the early lung cancer group, while 25 others with benign lung diseases who reported in our hospital during the same period were placed in the control group. Serum levels of Cyfra21-1 and HIF-1 alpha in both groups were quantified, and then 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning was done, so as to evaluate the clinical significance of both methods in early diagnosis of lung cancer. In a third approach, tissue levels of deoxyglucose and serum levels of Cyfra21-1 and HIF-1 alpha were determined simultaneously using 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning. Results: The scan revealed that the standard uptake value (SUV) of 80 patients with early lung cancer (10.51 +/- 4.23) was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.01). Levels of Cyfra21-1 and HIF-1 alpha were also significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.01), and also significantly higher in patients with squamous cell carcinoma than in those with adenocarcinoma or small cell carcinoma (P < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences in Cyfra21-1 and HIF-1 alpha levels among adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma and unclassified cancerpatients (P>0.05). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of Cyfra21-1 independently determined were 60.53%, 90.34%, and 80.52%, respectively, while those of HIF-1 alpha were 49.56%, 84.91%, and 65.23% respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/CT independently determined were 88.75%, 90.57%, and 90.05% respectively, while those of 18F-FDG PET/CT determined jointly with Cyfra21-1 and HIF-1 alpha were 97.04%, 98.62%, and 98.75%, respectively. There was statistical difference between the values of the independent and combined determinations (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The technique of combining 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning with determination of serum Cyfra21-1 and HIF-1 alpha levels is a considerably improved, accurate and sensitive approach for diagnosis of early stages of lung cancer.","[Qin, Ying Zhang Lei; Zhang, Changming] Liaocheng Peoples Hosp, Dept Imaging, Liaocheng, Peoples R China","Zhang, CM (corresponding author), 67 Dongchang Rd, Liaocheng City, Peoples R China.",or4363@163.com,,,,,,17,1,1,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,1.0,,,,,183.0,187,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_1_30,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AH,WOS:000424878600030,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: The study involved three sets of cells namely, experimental group, blank control group and DMSO group. The experimental group was treated with THZ1 at different concentrations, and cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay, while cell cycle and apoptosis analyses were assessed by flow cytometry. The expression of caspase-3/7 was determined by Western blot. Results: The rate of cell growth in the experimental group began to slow down from the third day in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The rate of growth of this group of cells was statistically significant when compared with blank control group and DMSO group (p < 0.05). Cell cycle determination showed that THZ1 arrested U373-MG cells in G1 phase, with relatively small number of cells in the S phase. This observation suggests that THZ1 blocks the proliferation of tumor cells by inhibiting cell cycle progression. Besides, THZ1 promoted the apoptosis of U373-MG cells and it probably accomplished this by increasing the activity of caspase-3/7 related apoptosis. Conclusion: Results from the present study indicate that THZ1 can inhibit the proliferation of human glioma U373-MG cells, block cell cycle progression and promote apoptosis.","[Qu Mingwei; Zhang Lihua] Cangzhou Cent Hosp, Dept Neurol, Cangzhou 061000, Hebei, Peoples R China","Zhang, LH (corresponding author), Cangzhou Cent Hosp, Dept Neurol, Cangzhou 061000, Hebei, Peoples R China.",874878927@qq.com,,,,,,14,0,0,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,871.0,875,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_133,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000037,,,,,2022-07-14

Various diseases can affect memory function and yield specific memory impairments. One of these conditions, transient global amnesia, is a peculiar type of memory loss with hallmark characteristics. However, the pathophysiological explanation for transient global amnesia remains controversial Methods: Starting with the most significant data from the literature, we describe the most important features needed for diagnosing the three main clinical conditions that could mimic transient global amnesia. Then, we describe a retrospective series of cases of transient global amnesia. Results: Among the cases observed, we focus on a case of transient global amnesia with features that distinguish it from the cases reported in the literature. Conclusion: This paper describes the key features of transient global amnesia, discusses the main differential diagnoses from similar conditions and proposes a pathogenetic interpretation consistent with all of the hallmarks of the disorder (amnesia duration, lack of specific neuroradiological and electroencephalo-graphic correlates or impaired sensitivity or motility, reversibility and benign prognosis of the amnesic episodes, and rare recurrence).","[Rampello, Luigi; Rampello, Liborio; Zappia, Mario] Univ Catania, Neurosci Sect, GF Ingrassia Dept, Via Santa Sofia 78, I-95123 Catania, Italy; [Malaguarnera, Giulia] Univ Catania, Res Ctr, Great Senescence, I-95123 Catania, Italy; [Chisari, Eleonora Margherita] Univ Catania, Dept Educ, I-95123 Catania, Italy; [Arcidiacono, Antonio] Univ Catania, Biometec Dept, Via Santa Sofia 78, I-95123 Catania, Italy","Rampello, L (corresponding author), Univ Catania, Dipartimento GF Ingrassia, Sez Neurosci, Via Santa Sofia 78, I-95123 Catania, Italy.",,"Zappia, Mario/AAB-7800-2019",,University of Catania [21040104],Financial support was provided by the University of Catania (code 21040104),,34,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,685.0,690,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_105,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000010,,,,,2022-07-14

BMD was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. BMD at L2 in men with T2DM was lower than in controls, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). BMD in women with T2DM was lower at Wards triangle and the femoral neck than in controls, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The prevalence of osteoporosis was higher in women with T2DM (55.20%) and women without T2DM (29.16%) than in men with T2DM (28.80%) and men without T2DM (21.66%), and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The prevalence of osteoporosis at L2 and L1-4 (5.40% and 16%) in men with T2DM was higher than that in men without T2DM (1.66% and 9.85%), and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The prevalence of osteoporosis at Wards angle, the femoral neck, and the femur (20%, 12.80%, and 42.40%) in women with T2DM was higher than that in women without T2DM (3.33%, 5%, and 17.91%), and the difference was statistically significant (P< 0.05).

CASE REPORT,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA,,,English,Article,,,,,,paraneoplastic pemphigus; rare; hypopharynx squamous cell carcinoma,PEMPHIGUS; NEOPLASIA; DISEASE; CANCER,"Introduction: Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is a rare autoimmune disease of the skin associated with neoplasm. It is mostly associated with lymphoproliferative disorders (nearly 84% of all cases are found in hematologic neoplasms). The underlying pathogenesis is believed to be triggered by altered immune system in response to underlying neoplasm. The manifestations can predate, occur at the same time or after the diagnosis of cancer. Males between 40 and 70 years are most frequently affected. The prognosis of PNP is generally poor, and the disease is often fatal. The occurrence of PNP with squamous cell carcinoma is rare. We have chosen to present this case because PNP is a very rare paraneoplastic manifestation (in literature less than 500 cases were described), having poor prognosis, anddue to the fact that its association withhypopharynx squamous cell carcinoma is not commonly seen. Case presentation: We present the case of a 67-year-old male with squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynxassociated with PNP. The patient treatment performed was external beam radiotherapy, concomitant with chemotherapy. A skin biopsy was performed and it revealed pemphigoid lesions. Conclusions: This kind of case is rare because the PNP is rarely associated with a hypopharynx carcinoma and also because the particularities regarding diagnosis and challenging treatment. After the oncological treatment, the evolution was favorable, with amelioration of symptomatology, pemphigoid lesions andtumorregression. Unfortunately, the patient was not present at the visit 6months after treatment, being lost to follow-up.","[Rebegea, Laura] Sf Ap Andrei Emergency Clin Hosp, Dept Radiotherapy, Galati, Romania; [Rebegea, Laura; Romila, Aurelia] Dunarea Jos Univ Galati, Fac Med & Pharm, Med Clin Dept, Galati, Romania; [Stefan, Ana-Maria] Prof Dr AlexandruTrestioreanu Oncol Inst, Radiotherapy Clin, Bucharest, Romania; [Firescu, Dorel] Sf Ap Andrei Emergency Clin Hosp, Surg Clin 2, Galati, Romania; [Firescu, Dorel] Dunarea Jos Univ Galati, Fac Med & Pharm, Surg Clin Dept, Galati, Romania; [Miron, Dumitra] Sf Ap Andrei Emergency Clin Hosp, Pathol Anat Dept, Galati, Romania; [Romila, Aurelia] Sf Ap Andrei Emergency Clin Hosp, Geriatr Dept, Galati, Romania","Firescu, D (corresponding author), Sf Ap Andrei Emergency Clin Hosp, Surg Clin 2, Galati, Romania.;Firescu, D (corresponding author), Dunarea Jos Univ Galati, Fac Med & Pharm, Surg Clin Dept, Galati, Romania.",dorelfirescu@yahoo.com,"Firescu, Dorel/AAB-2808-2019",,,,,28,6,6,0,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1265.0,1270,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_195,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700017,,,,,2022-07-14

Eugenol has therapeutic effect on tumor, However, the mechanism of the treatment is not clear, the purpose of this study is to evaluate eugenol anti-tumor effect on ER positive precancerous lesions of breast cancer. Material and methods: 40 female SD rats were randomized into 5 groups, 8 in each. The groups were named Blank control group, Model group, Tamoxifen group, The low dose of Eugenol cream group (0.5mg) and The high dose of Eugenol cream group (1mg) respectively. The rats with breast precancerous lesions were induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) combined with estrogen and progesterone injection. Drug interventions by tamoxifen(TAM) ointment and Eugenol cream were also launched during the model formation. The rats were executed after 70d. In MCF-10AT cell lines, we use 180 mu M eugenol to treat the cell lines, then observed 24 hours. And then the correlated indexes are detected by Western-blot and elisa. Results: 1mg eugenol significantly delayed the pathology process of rat breast tissue models in precancerous lesions of breast cancer, meanwhile, 1mg eugenol reduced the level of serum estradiol(E2) and the reduce rate was 36%, increased progesterone(P) and the increase rate was 26%, in addition, the protein levels of ER alpha, GPER, p-AKT, GSK3-alpha, GSK3-beta, p70s6k were decreased in the rat models and the decreased rates were respectively 31%, 53%, 57%, 58%, 56%, 93%, as well as MCF-10AT cell lines were treated with 180 mu M eugenol, the decreased rates were respectively 35%, 60%, 63%, 57%, 42%, 68% (P < 0.01). However, in rat models the expressions of PTEN and ER beta protein were increased and the increase rates were 76%, 58% (P < 0.05), in MCF-10AT cell lines the increase rates of the expressions of PTEN and ER beta protein were 46%, 177%. Discussion: eugenol is effective in the treatment of ER positive precancerous lesions of breast cancer, indicating that eugenol may be a new effective drug in treating ER positive precancerous lesions of breast cancer.","[Rui, Liao; Zhang Guijuan] Jinan Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Bie Fengjie; Min, Ma] Jinan Univ, Sch Tradit Chinese Med, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Rui, Liao] Guangdong Pharmaceut Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yi, Ma] Jinan Univ, Bioengn Inst, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Min, M (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Sch Tradit Chinese Med, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",1019312292@qq.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation Project of China [81173265, 81473688, 81373314, 81673979]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China [2014A020210015, 2013B090500105, 2014A020212672]; Education Program of China for New Century Excellent Talents [NCET-13-0827]; Traditional Chinese Medicine Administration Project of Guangdong Province, China [20141070]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2015A030313333, 2015A030313345, 2016A030313114]; Science and Technology Support Program of Guangzhou, China [2014J4100104, 201707010245]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [21615412, 21615464]; Guangzhou Municipal Enterprise Research and Development Institutions Construction Project [201503010064]; Cooperation Ombudsman Workstation Project in Industry, Education and Research of Guangdong Province, China [2013B090900010]","The current work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation Project of China (no. 81173265, 81473688, 81373314 and 81673979); The Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China (no. 2014A020210015, 2013B090500105 and 2014A020212672); Education Program of China for New Century Excellent Talents (no.

Furthermore, since it is known that comprehensive warm up program helps in prevention injuries, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a comprehensive warm-up program (F-MARC The 11+) on performance and injuries in young basketball players. While knowing the specifics and possible injuries of basketball game, the prevention of injuries must be considered as an important issue. Methods: Twenty children (mean +/- SD: age 10,7 +/- 0,3 yr; height 149,20 +/- 7.51, weight 47,61 +/- 12,30 kg, percentage of body fat: 14,44 +/- 7,68 %) were recruited from two local basketball clubs to participate in this study. Players were randomly selected and assigned to either group: experimental (Exp. n = 10) or a control (Con. n = 10), respectively. They were trained 3 days per week (2,1 +/- 0,6 years of experience), for 10 weeks in a row. The experimental group followed the F-MARC 11+ program for 20 minutes during warm up phase in each training season for ten weeks while control group performed their regular warm up routine. Both groups performed vertical jumps and pro agility tests at the beginning and at the end of the tenth-week training sessions. Moreover, nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed to compare the pre and post test scores. Results: The agility pre-test result was found 6,358 +/- 0, 27 seconds and post-test was found 6,121 +/- 0, 34 seconds. A significant difference was found between agility test values (p<0,05) Discussion: Comprehensive warm-up program leads to a significant change in agility in the present study. Therefore, this is a desirable result since basketball is characterized by many quick movements such as sudden speed-ups, stops and turns. Eventually, previous studies indicated that the FIFA 11+ program resulted to be an important way to warm up properly before training sessions. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study we may conclude that The F-MARC 11+ comprehensive warm-up is an appropriate and effective tool for improving basketball-specific performance such as agility in young basketball players.","[Sahin, Nese] Ankara Univ, Fac Sport Sci, Ankara, Turkey; [Gurses, Veli Volkan; Baydil, Bilgehan; Akgul, Mustafa Sakir] Kastamonu Univ, Sch Phys Educ & Sport, Kastamonu, Turkey; [Feka, Kaltrina] Univ Palermo, PhD Program Hlth Promot & Cognit Sci, Sport & Exercise Sci Res Unit, Palermo, Italy; [Iovane, Angelo; Messina, Giuseppe] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Sport & Exercise Sci Res Unit, Palermo, Italy","Messina, G (corresponding author), Via Giovanni Pascoli 6, I-90144 Palermo, Italy.",giuseppe.messina17@unipa.it,"AKGÜL, Mustafa Şakir/AAT-8696-2020; Messina, Giuseppe/N-7298-2019","AKGÜL, Mustafa Şakir/0000-0002-9696-6541; Messina, Giuseppe/0000-0003-2774-4950; Feka, Kaltrina/0000-0003-1293-7995",,,,24,1,1,2,12,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,703.0,707,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_108,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000013,,,,,2022-07-14

The use of atypical antipsychotics also increases the risk of metabolic syndrome. This study aimed to evaluate the association between schizoaffective disorder and risk of incident metabolic syndrome and the relationship with the drugs used. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study included patients diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. The study group consisted of 77 outpatients aged 18 to 65 years, prescribed any antipsychotic medication between September 2013 and August 2014. Metabolic syndrome was defined using the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program - Adult Treatment Protocol and the National Cholesterol Education Program - Adapted Adult Treatment Protocol. Results: Metabolic syndrome was found in 33.8% according to National Cholesterol Education Program - Adult Treatment Protocol diagnostic criteria, 36.4% according to National Cholesterol Education Program - Adapted Adult Treatment Protocol diagnostic criteria of the patients. When we grouped patients treated with typical antipsychotic, atypical antipsychotics and typical & atypical antipsychotics in combination, there was no significant difference for prevalence of metabolic syndrome among any groups. Metabolic syndrome prevalence was significantly higher in study subjects using antidepressants in combination with antipsychotics. Conclusions: The results suggest that metabolic syndrome risk is common among patients with schizoaffective disorder. Our data shows that systemic inflammation plays a key role in both schizoaffective disorder and metabolic syndrome so chronic comorbid disorders should be treated concurrently and all risk factors like that weight loss, regular physical activity, smoking cessation should be eliminated by modifying life style.","[Sahin, Sengul Kocamer] Adana State Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Adana, Turkey; [Elboga, Gulcin; Unal, Ahmet; Altindag, Abdurrahman] Gaziantep Univ, Med Fac, Dept Psychiat, Gaziantep, Turkey; [Kilic, Osman Hasan Tahsin] Zonguldak Ataturk State Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Zonguldak, Gaziantep, Turkey; [Sahin, Ahmet Ziya] Adana Askim Tufekci State Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Adana, Turkey","Elboga, G (corresponding author), Gaziantep Univ, Med Fac, Dept Psychiat, Sahinbey, Gaziantep, Turkey.",,"kılıç, osman/AAK-2864-2020; Elboga, Gulcin/AAG-6587-2020; Altindag, Abdurrahman/AAG-6463-2020; Ünal, Ahmet/ABH-9455-2020; Şahin, Şengül/AAI-2398-2019","Altindag, Abdurrahman/0000-0001-5531-4419; Ünal, Ahmet/0000-0002-8612-528X; Şahin, Şengül/0000-0002-5371-3907",,,,27,1,1,0,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,1.0,,,,,133.0,137,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_1_22,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AH,WOS:000424878600022,,,,,2022-07-14

Efforts on improving treatment modalities and survival is still the most hot topic worldwide. One of the key points is finding out a reliable and cost-effective marker that can predict prognosis. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been shown to be associated with prognosis in various clinical situations. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of NLR at admission and disease severity and 28-day mortality in sepsis and septic shock patients. Materials and methods: Patients over 18 years of age admitted to Medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with the diagnosis of sepsis and septic shock between January 1st ,2010 and January 1st ,2016 were enrolled retrospectively. NLR at ICU admission of each patient was calculated from whole blood test results. Results: A total of 314 patients, 159 men and 155 women, were included in the study. 185 patients (58.9%) were diagnosed as sepsis and 129 patients (41.1%) as septic shock. NLR was significantly higher in the septic shock group (sepsis: 14.7, septic shock: 21.5) (p<0.05). 118 patients (37.6%) survived, and 196 (62.4%) died. While APACHE II scores (survivors: 21; non-survivors: 25) and expected mortality rates (survivors: 38%; non-survivors: 53%) were significantly different between two groups (p<0,05), no significant relationship between NLR and mortality could be detected (p>0.05). Conclusion: In our study, there was no significant relationship between NLR and mortality but, NLR was related to severity of sepsis. We suggest NLR should be used in detecting severity of sepsis besides APACHE and SOFA scores which will increase physicians' awareness during the management of therapy.","[Savran, Yusuf] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Izmir, Turkey; [Mengi, Tugce; Yaka, Erdem] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Neurol, Izmir, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Baris] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pulmonol, Izmir, Turkey; [Tokur, Murat E.] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Izmir, Turkey; [Ergan, Begum] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pulmonol & Intens Care, Izmir, Turkey; [Comert, Bilgin] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med & Intens Care, Izmir, Turkey","Savran, Y (corresponding author), Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Izmir, Turkey.",yusuf.savran@deu.edu.tr,"Mengi, Tuğçe/AAA-4505-2022; Cömert, Bilgin/P-3030-2019; Savran, Yusuf/AAI-1796-2019; Ergan, Begum/U-8276-2017","Cömert, Bilgin/0000-0002-2148-5356; Ergan, Begum/0000-0003-2920-9214",,,,18,2,2,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,877.0,882,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_134,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000038,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: The sample of this experimental study consisted of 63 women with type 2 DM registered to in family health centers in Turkey. The data were collected using the description form and the Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale (ESES). Mean fasting glucose levels, mean nonfasting glucose levels, mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values and number of hypoglycemic attacks were compared to the initially, 6th month, and 12th month in study. Results: During the study period, a statistically significant decrease in mean fasting glucose levels, mean nonfasting glucose levels, mean HbA1c values, and number of hypoglycemic attacks were observed (p < 0.05). The scores for ESES and weekly duration of exercise (minute) of the experimental group increased during follow-up in women with type 2 DM receiving MI about exercise. While 26% of the women with type 2 DM had regular health check-ups before the motivation activity, during the MI, regular followup ratio improved and increased up to 81%. Conclusion: This study showed that MI might provide significant improvement in the glisemic control and exercise behavior of women with type 2 DM. The frequency of regular health checkups for women throughout MI has increased. It is suggested that for the effectiveness of MI compare or combine it with other interventional methods.","[Sekerci, Yasemin Gumus] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Hatay Sch Hlth, Dept Publ Hlth Nursing, Antakya, Turkey","Sekerci, YG (corresponding author), Mustafa Kemal Univ, Antakya, Turkey.",y.gumus36@hotmail.com,,,,,,30,0,0,1,12,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,383.0,389,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_60,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400014,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: A total of 102 MN patients admitted from March 2015 to December 2017 were selected and divided into prognosis-good group (event-free survival) and prognosis-poor group (severe complications or death) based on analysis of their prognosis. After comparing clinical features from the two groups, predictive values of CXCL16 and podocin expressions for poor prognosis were determined by ROC curve method, and the independent risk factors for MN prognosis were determined by logistic regression analysis model. Results: Twenty-seven (27) (26.47 %) patients presented with poor prognosis, while 75 patients (73.53 %) had good prognosis. In the prognosis-good group, serum creatinine level (>= 186 mu mol/L), 24-h urine protein (> 3.5g), tubular-interstitial injury area (>= 25 %), and proportion of patients in stage III-IV were lower than corresponding values in prognosis-poor group. However, in prognosis-poor group, serum CXCL16 level and glomerular podocin expression were significantly higher (p < 0.05). The areas under curve of CXCL16 and podocin were 0.828 and 0.791, respectively. The independent risk factors for poor MN prognosis included serum creatinine, 24-h urine protein, severity of tubular-interstitial injury; increase in, and pathological staging of serum CXCL16 level (stage III-IV), and decrease in glomerular podocin expression (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The expressions of serum CXCL16 and glomerular podocin are independent risk factors and show high predictive value for poor MN prognosis. Thus, they can be used as important clinical indexes for evaluating the conditions of patients.","[Shang, Yu] Xian Med Univ, Sch Clin Med, Xian 710021, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Tan, Feng] Fourth Peoples Hosp Shanxi Prov, Dept Nephrol, Xian 710043, Shanxi, Peoples R China","Shang, Y (corresponding author), Xian Med Univ, Sch Clin Med, Xian 710021, Shanxi, Peoples R China.",vu1205@163.com,,,,,,22,0,0,1,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1405.0,1410,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700036,,,,,2022-07-14

During preoperative Hunt-Hess grading, there are three cases of Grade III, seven cases of Grade IV and two cases of Grade V. The preoperative diagnosis shows that all the patients have aneurysm rupture. After CT of initial diagnosis, 11 cases show subdural hematoma and only one case (Case 11) shows subdural hematoma after CT of initial diagnosis but turns out to be multiple intracranial aneurysms after the digital shadow angiography; disturbance of consciousness suddenly occurred during the operation and the emergency operation is given before CT reexamination and emergency intubation; in the operation, it is proved that there is subdural hematoma and temporal lobe intracranial hematoma. All the 11 patients will accept Phase I hematoma clearance, aneurysm occlusion and craniotomy of subdural hematoma. The hippocrepiform incision at central line of forehead will be adopted for two cases of pericallosal aneurysm and the middle approach will be adopted for craniotomy (Case 2 and Case 5); the extensive pterional approach shall be adopted for the other nine cases. Results: For the 11 cases with aneurysm occlusion, the CT angiography shows that the aneurysm is completely occluded from operation to discharge and the hematoma is thoroughly cleared. In GOS assessment for 12 patients in the study, three cases have a good recovery, five cases are moderate disability, three cases are severe disability and one case is dead. Conclusion: The clinic occurrence rate of intracranial aneurysm with acute subdural hematoma is relatively low, but the occurrence is rapid and the disease progresses quickly, so the condition is severe; after admission, in case of decline, accurate diagnosis early aneurysm occlusion and hematoma clearance, the clinical effect for the patients after treatment can be effectively improved.","[Shao, Jing; Gu, Shengli] Cent Hosp Shanghai Zhabei Dist, Neurol Dept, 619 Zhonghua Rd, Shanghai 200070, Peoples R China; [Liu, Gailing] Shanghai T Lukes Hosp, Neurol Dept, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shaohui] Shanghai St Lukes Hosp, Rehabil Dept, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Ye, Xiaojing; Zhao, Jing; Shen, Cui] Shanghai City Changning Dist Xianxia Community Hl, Gen Practice, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Gu, SL (corresponding author), 619 Zhonghua Rd, Shanghai 200070, Peoples R China.",hh18888@126.com,,,,,,13,0,0,1,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1233.0,1238,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_189,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700011,,,,,2022-07-14

Herein, we aimed to investigate the roles of miR-222 in esophageal cancer cells, particularly in regulating response to proliferation. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line, TE11 cells, was transfected with miR-222 mimic, inhibitor or their negative controls. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and EdU incorporation assay were used to analyze Cell proliferation. MiR-222 and expression levels of its putative target genes (p27 and p57) were detected using qRT-PCR and Western blot. Our results showed that overexpression of miR-222 enhanced TE11 cell proliferation, and expression level of p27Kip1 was negatively moderated by miR-222 up-regulation at post-transcriptional level. Finally, we transfected miR-222 inhibitor and p27 si-RNA into TE11 cells, and found that proliferation-suppressing effects of miR-222 inhibitor on TE11 cells could be partially reversed by silencing p27, indicating that p27 is a target gene of miR-222 during TE11 cell proliferation. Our data suggests that miR-222 overexpression controls TE11 cell growth by down-regulating p27.

Method: A total of 64 RA patients presented with liver and kidney yin deficiency were selected for this study. They were divided into three groups: control (12 patients), osteopania (22 patients), and osteoporosis (30 patients). The patients were subjected to routine blood analysis and estimations of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factors (IgARF, IgMRF, IgGRF), cyclic citrulinated peptide antibody (CCP antibody), bone metabolism index and bone mineral density (BMD). Results: Patients in the osteoporosis group presented with RA of the damp-heat blockage type. The BMD was correlated with the CCP antibody, and patients with osteoporosis had relatively high CCP antibody levels. The hemoglobin concentration was correlated with BMD, and it was higher in the control group. There was a negative correlation between the acute inflammation index and the parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. There was also a negative correlation between IgMRF, CCP antibody, PTH and hip BMD levels. Patients above 65 years had double risks of hip osteoporosis, relative to others. The occurrence of osteoporosis on lumbar vertebra and hip in patients with abnormal erythrocyte sedimentation rate was about 10 times higher than those with normal ESR. Patients with high CCP antibody titer had 7 times higher occurrence of lumbar vertebra osteoporosis, and more than 9 times higher occurrence of hip osteoporosis, relative to the control group. Conclusion: Age, ESR and CCP antibody levels are closely related to BMD, and are predisposing factors to secondary osteoporosis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients above 65 years who present with liver and kidney yin deficiency have high ESR and CCP antibody level and low hemoglobin concentrations.","[Shi, Wen-Jia; Tian, Ke-Wei; Ye, Ye; Yan, Jia-Xiang; Chen, Ke] Orthoped Hosp Henan Prov, Dept Hip Injury & Dis, Luoyang 471000, Henan, Peoples R China","Chen, K (corresponding author), Orthoped Hosp Henan Prov, Dept Hip Injury & Dis, Luoyang 471000, Henan, Peoples R China.",ro1322@163.com,,,,,,9,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1437.0,1440,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_218,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700040,,,,,2022-07-14

On the other hand, smoking cessation may also lead to gaining weight and MetS. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of short-term smoking cessation on MetS parameters. Materials and methods:The study was performed in 150 subjects willing to cease cigarette smoking. Varenicline or bupropion was started to the subjects ceasing smoking as a supportive treatment, and current diet exercises were continued. MetS incidence was evaluated before and at week 12 with the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP III). Results: Of 150 subjects, 74 continued smoking cessation at week 12. Compared to the baseline values, it was seen that body weight (p<0.001), waist circumference (WC) (p<0.001), body mass index (BM) (p<0.001) and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (p<0.001) levels increased at the 12th week. However, blood pressure (BP), blood glucose and triglyceride (TG) levels remained unchanged. Presence of MetS was found 8.1% at the baseline and 17.6% at the end of the study (p=0.118). Of all subjects, while present in 43.2% at initial, WC criteria for MetS, then, increased to 54.1% at week 12 (p=0.039). Although present in 68.9% of subjects at the baseline, HDL-cholesterol criteria decreased to 50.0% at week 12 (p=0.001). Conclusions: Although an increase was observed in WC, body weight and BMI, we observed no changes in MetS frequency within 12-week period. Administration of appropriate calorie-restricting diet and exercise may prevent weight gain and MetS to develop after smoking cessation.","[Solak, Ibrahim; Demirtepe, Ibrahim; Pekgor, Selma] Univ Hlth Sci, Konya Hlth Applicat & Res Ctr, Dept Family Med, Konya, Turkey; [Duran, Cevdet] Usak Univ, Div Endocrinol & Internal Med, Med Sch, Usak, Turkey; [Eryilmaz, Mehmet Ali] Univ Hlth Sci, Konya Hlth Applicat & Res Ctr, Dept Gen Surg, Konya, Turkey; [Eryilmaz, Mehmet Ali] Univ Hlth Sci, Konya Hlth Applicat & Res Ctr, Family Med Clin, Konya, Turkey","Solak, I (corresponding author), Univ Hlth Sci, Konya Hlth Applicat & Res Ctr, Dept Family Med, Konya, Turkey.",isolaktr@yahoo.com,"Solak, Ibrahim/F-2225-2019; Duran, Cevdet/AAB-6174-2020; pekgör, selma/ABB-6440-2020","Solak, Ibrahim/0000-0001-5311-0631; pekgör, selma/0000-0001-9907-1842",Konya Training and Research Hospital,The study was funded by the research fund of Konya Training and Research Hospital.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the change of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of low-shrinkage composite resins after long-term water immersion. Materials and methods: Immersed in distilled water at 37. for 24 h, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months, the CTE of six kinds of composite resin were measured with a thermomechanical analyzer (TMA). The measured data were statistically analyzed. Additionally, the surface morphology of the composite resins were evaluated after long-term water immersion. Results: After water immersion, the CTE increased initially, then reduced or remained stable with changing temperature and time. Conclusion: The change of the CTE is closely related to the composition of the composite resin. The CTE of epoxide and prepolymerized filler in low-shrinkage composite resin is relatively stable, and the CTE of high-content filler nanometer resin is the closest to the thermal expansion coefficient of tooth structure.","[Song, Aiyang; Zhang, Jiahui; Liu, Zhaoying; Zhao, Qi; Gao, Ping; Wei, Qianqian; Zhu, Song] Jilin Univ, Sch & Hosp Stomatol, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China","Zhu, S (corresponding author), 1500 Qinghua Rd, Changchun 130021, Jilin, Peoples R China.",zhusong1965@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81371185],"This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, Grant No. 81371185).",,26,0,0,0,20,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,4.0,,,,,989.0,995,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4_150,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ1AT,WOS:000434986500013,,,,,2022-07-14

The present pilot study aims to evaluate behavioral aspects in a small population of siblings of ASD children. Material and methods: Population: 5 school-aged children (2 males, 3 females) (mean age 9.235 +/- 2.041) were enrolled, as siblings of ASD children, and for comparison, 12 healthy (7 males, 5 females) children (average age 9,528 +/- 3,351). All subjects underwent evaluation of the behavioral with Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scale. Results: The two groups were statistically comparable by age (p = 0.86) and gender distribution (p = 0.87). From the behavioral point of view evaluated with the CBCL scale, siblings of ASD have a higher degree of overall problem (Total problems) compared to control children (p=0.003), in addition they have significantly higher scores in the subscales of behavior examined (Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints, Social, Thought, Attention, Delinquent, Aggressive) as well as a greater share of disturbances both internalizing (p=0.004) and externalizing (p = 0.007) (Table 1). Conclusions: The present preliminary data confirm the need for a global management of the entire family structure for the correct management of Autistic Disorders.","[Sorrentino, Michele] Pineta Grande Hosp, NICU Preterm & High Risk Newborn Neurodev Follow, Castel Volturno, CE, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele; Ruberto, Maria] Univ Palermo, Dept PROSAMI, Palermo, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] CH Chinon, Childhood Psychiat Serv Neurodev Disorders, Chinon, France; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, Palermo, Italy; [Russo, Daniela] Ctr Riabilitaz La Filanda LARS, Sarno, Italy; [Di Folco, Annabella; Testa, Davide; Parisi, Lucia] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Educ Sci & Human Movement, Palermo, Italy; [Lavano, Serena Marianna; Marotta, Rosa; Lavano, Francesco] Magna Graecia Univ Catanzaro, Dept Hlth Sci, Catanzaro, Italy; [Cerroni, Francesco] Ctr Manzoni Srl, Naples, Italy; [Romano, Palmira] Ctr Riabilitaz LARS, Sarno, Italy; [Gallai, Beatrice] Univ Perugia, Dept Surg & Biomed Sci, Perugia, Italy; [Magliulo, Rosaria Martina] Ctr Scoliosi SRL, Naples, Italy; [D'Oro, Lucrezia] Ctr Ambulatoriale Santo Stefano, Pesaro, Italy; [Marsala, Gabriella] Osped Riuniti Foggia, Azienda Osped Univ, Struttura Complessa Farm, Foggia, Italy; [Montana, Angelo; Franco, Sabrina; Geraci, Diego] Univ Catania, Dept Med Surg & Adv Technol Sci GF Ingrassia, Catania, Italy; [Chisari, Mario Giuseppe] INPS, Catania, Italy; [Picciocchi, Elisabetta] Univ Foggia, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Foggia, Italy; [Picciocchi, Elisabetta] Casa Cura Villa Fiori Acerra, Naples, Italy; [Polito, Anna Nunzia] Complex Struct Neuropsychiat Childhood Adolescenc, Foggia, Italy; [Murabito, Paolo] Univ Catania, Catania, Italy; CRD Santa Maria Pozzo, Somma Vesuviana, Italy","Sorrentino, M (corresponding author), Pineta Grande Hosp, NICU Preterm & High Risk Newborn Neurodev Follow, Castel Volturno, CE, Italy.",,"Marotta, Rosa/AAG-1453-2020","Cerroni, Francesco/0000-0003-3024-5482; Marotta, Rosa/0000-0003-0515-5952; Murabito, Paolo/0000-0002-2662-1898",,,,99,0,0,2,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,4.0,,2097.0,2105,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4s_324,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,HA4LD,WOS:000450232900004,,,,,2022-07-14

There are two types of orexin peptides: the orexin-A (OXA or hypocretin 1) and orexin-B (OXB or hypocretin 2). The Majority of the central nervous system orexin peptides are synthesized in neurons located in the lateral and back hypothalamus and send projections throughout the brain regions Orexin neurons are multi-tasking hence regulating also energy homeostasis, reward systems and feeding behaviour through connection with hypothalamic nuclei and through responsiveness to leptine and glucose. It has recently been found a connection with lymbic system suggesting a further possible role of orexins in regulating emotions. All the studies conducted confirm that orexin system regulates vigilance states, energy homeostasis, reward system, and emotions. These crucial role might be the target to develope treatments of narcolepsy, obesity, emotional stress, and drug addiction.","[Sperandeo, Raffaele] Univ Campania, Dept Expt Med, Sect Human Physiol, Naples, Italy; [Sperandeo, Raffaele] Univ Campania, Unit Dietet & Sport Med, Naples, Italy; [Maldonato, Mauro N.; Messina, Antonietta; Monda, Marcellino] Univ Basilicata, Dept Human Sci, Potenza, Italy; [Cozzolino, Pasquale] SiPGI Postgrad Sch Integrated Gestalt Psychothera, DM 12 10 2007, Naples, Italy; [Cerroni, Francesco; Romano, Palmira] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Mental Hlth Phys & Prevent Med, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Naples, Italy; [Marotta, Rosa R.] Magna Graecia Univ Catanzaro, Dept Hlth Sci, Catanzaro, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita; Maltese, Agata; Roccella, Michele; Parisi, Lucia; Tripi, Gabriele] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol & Pedag Sci, Child Neuropsychiat, Palermo, Italy; [Moscatelli, Fiorenzo; Sessa, Francesco; Salerno, Monica; Cibelli, Giuseppe; Messina, Giovanni; Velenzano, Anna] Univ Foggia, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Foggia, Italy; [Monda, Vincenzo; Chieffi, Sergio; Villano, Ines; Monda, Emanuele] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Expt Med, Sect Human Physiol, Naples, Italy; [Monda, Vincenzo; Chieffi, Sergio; Villano, Ines; Monda, Emanuele] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Unit Dietet & Sports Med, Naples, Italy; [Ruberto, Maria] Ctr CRD, Naples, Italy; [Marsala, Gabriella] Azienda Osped Univ, Struttura Complessa Farm, Foggia, Italy","Velenzano, A (corresponding author), Univ Foggia, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Foggia, Italy.",anna.valenzano@unifg.it,"Monda, Emanuele/AAQ-6457-2020; MESSINA, ANTONIETTA/K-9366-2016; Messina, Antonietta/AHH-2383-2022; Moscatelli, Fiorenzo/ABC-9536-2020; Sessa, Francesco/G-1754-2018; Cibelli, Giuseppe/AAC-2635-2019; Messina, Giovanni/AAE-8668-2022; Marotta, Rosa/AAG-1453-2020; SALERNO, MONICA/AAC-1321-2019; MALDONATO, NELSON MAURO/AAG-3791-2021","Monda, Emanuele/0000-0001-9304-988X; Messina, Antonietta/0000-0001-8343-432X; Sessa, Francesco/0000-0003-0357-8791; Messina, Giovanni/0000-0002-0011-867X; SALERNO, MONICA/0000-0002-6410-3960; MALDONATO, NELSON MAURO/0000-0002-6401-2305; Moscatelli, Fiorenzo/0000-0003-1274-0332; Sperandeo, Raffaele/0000-0002-8892-179X; VILLANO, INES/0000-0002-1755-358X; Monda, Marcellino/0000-0002-7184-218X; Marotta, Rosa/0000-0003-0515-5952; Monda, Vincenzo/0000-0002-6083-5814; TRIPI, Gabriele/0000-0001-7088-9325; Cerroni, Francesco/0000-0003-3024-5482; CIBELLI, GIUSEPPE/0000-0002-5371-2584",,,,86,22,23,0,8,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,349.0,356,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_55,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400009,,,,,2022-07-14

Current studies interpret this relationship as a linear concatenation that starts from a damage of the prefrontal cortical areas, produces a deficit of the executive functions and finally evolves towards the development of pathological character traits. In an enacted cognition perspective, the relationship between executive functions and personality should be interpreted according to a circular causality model that appears ecologically more realistic and adequate to empirical data. The present study evaluates executive functions and personality dimensions in a sample of 130 subjects using the Frontal Assessment Battery, the Temperament and Character Inventory, respectively. The results show that subjects with low empathic and emotional propensities, detected through 9 items of Temperament and Character Inventory, while not presenting any kind of disturbances, show Executive Functions that are not efficient or even inadequate. These data are not easily explained according to the classic linear model and seem to confirm the circular perspective proposed by the embodied cognition theory. However, an expansion of the sample is essential to obtain confirmation of the data that emerged.","[Sperandeo, Raffaele; Moretto, Enrico; Di Sarno, Alfonso Davide; Longobardi, Teresa] SiPGI Postgrad Sch Integrated Gestalt Psychothera, DM 12-10-2007,Via V Veneto 240, I-80058 Naples, Italy; [Picciocchi, Elisabetta; Valenzano, Anna; Cibelli, Giuseppe; Ruberto, Valentina] Univ Foggia, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Foggia, Italy; [Picciocchi, Elisabetta] Casa Cura Villa Fiori Acerra, Naples, Italy; [Monda, Vincenzo; Messina, Antonietta] Univ Campania, Dept Expt Med, Sect Human Physiol, Naples, Italy; [Monda, Vincenzo; Messina, Antonietta] Univ Campania, Unit Dietet & Sport Med, Naples, Italy; [Dell'Orco, Silvia; Maldonato, Nelson Mauro] Univ Basilicata, Dept Human Sci, Potenza, Italy; [Marsala, Gabriella] Osped Riuniti Foggia, Azienda Osped Univ, Foggia, Italy; [Polito, Anna Nunzia] Osped Riuniti Foggia, Complex Struct Neuropsychiat Childhood Adolescenc, Foggia, Italy","Sperandeo, R (corresponding author), SiPGI Postgrad Sch Integrated Gestalt Psychothera, DM 12-10-2007,Via V Veneto 240, I-80058 Naples, Italy.",raffaele.sperandeo@gmail.com,"Messina, Antonietta/AHH-2383-2022; MESSINA, ANTONIETTA/K-9366-2016; Cibelli, Giuseppe/AAC-2635-2019; MALDONATO, NELSON MAURO/AAG-3791-2021; Moretto, Enrico/AFV-4935-2022","Messina, Antonietta/0000-0001-8343-432X; MALDONATO, NELSON MAURO/0000-0002-6401-2305; MORETTO, ENRICO/0000-0002-1726-7866; Sperandeo, Raffaele/0000-0002-8892-179X; CIBELLI, GIUSEPPE/0000-0002-5371-2584; Monda, Vincenzo/0000-0002-6083-5814",,,,91,16,16,1,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1271.0,1279,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_196,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700018,,,,,2022-07-14

Aim: To determine the effect of strength training program on muscle mass in patients on hemodialysis. Methodology: The study runs organized in the Center for Hemodialysis, Kosovska Mitrovica, Serbia for the duration of 8 weeks. It involved 25 patients, 18 (72%) men and 7 (28%) women, of average age 52.9 +/- 14 years, who had received chronic hemodialysis for 3 x 3-4 hours, for at least 3 months using commercially available dialysers. During the first two hemodialyses, twice a week for 15-20 minutes, exercises were performed with a load to increase muscle mass of the upper and lower extremities together with isometric muscle contractions to strengthen the quadriceps, as well as a lateral flexion of the spinal column. Measurements were made before and after exercise. Routine laboratory analyses, oxygen saturation, demographic, anthropometric and clinical characteristics of the subjects were also evaluated. Results: After exercise oxygen saturation (p = 0.04) and venous pressure (p = 0.009) were significantly lower than preexercise values. Muscle strength of the fist (p = 0.001), the upper arm (p = 0.005) and forearms (p <0.001) also differed significantly before and after exercise. After exercise lower extremity muscles were significantly stronger, both in relation to the left and right muscles of the shin and thighs. Left side (p = 0.002) and right-side = (p = 0.017) spinal column flexion was significantly higher after exercise. Conclusion: The study confirmed the positive effect of strength training program on the size of the exercising muscles, lateral flexion of the spinal column and venous pressure.","[Stolic, Radojica V.] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Med Sci, Dept Internal Med, Kragujevac, Serbia; [Trajkovic, Goran Z.; Pavlovic, Vedrana] Univ Belgrade, Inst Med Stat & Informat, Fac Med, Belgrade, Serbia; [Matijasevic, Ivana R.; Jaksic, Masa D.; Mirkovic, Zlatica M.; Smilic, Ljiljana; Milinic, Srbislava B.; Odalovic, Dragica; Vasic, Aleksandar; Stolic, Boban Z.] Univ Pristina Kosovska Mitrovica, Fac Med, Pristina K Mitrovica, Serbia","Stolic, BZ (corresponding author), Fac Med Sci, Svetozar Markovic 69, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia.",radojica.stolic@med.pr.ac.rs,"Stolic, Radojica/AAH-7049-2021","Stolic, Radojica/0000-0002-6215-9258",Ministry of Education and Science of Serbia [III41010],"The authors disclose receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

However, if PET/CT can reduce the variability of interobserver in the target amount delineation remains to be answered. The present study assesses how accurate PET/CT is in identification of nodal metastasis as well as nodal staging and its impact on the radiotherapy amount delineation to patients of NSCLC. Methods: In total, 27 patients with NSCLC were recruited and scanned with PET/CT. Sets of PETS as well as CT data could be delivered to the treatment planning system (TPS), followed by the fusing of CT and PET images using TPS. Two radiation oncologists on CT and PET/CT images were employed to contour gross tumor volume (GTV). The contours were outlined together with two radiation oncologists, thus producing a final consensus. Results: Tumor-node-metastasis categories changed on 8/27 patients (30%) on the basis of PET/CT. Radiation on PET and CT integration images led to changes in treatment arrangements on 12/20 patients (60%). In addition, PET/CT produced significant accuracy for nodal staging than CT. The negative and positive predictive values, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PET/CT to detect nodal metastasis were 74.3%, 89.3%, 51.5%, 95.8%, and 87.3% and the corresponding CT data were respectively 45.5%, 87.1%, 45.5%, 87.1%, and 79.2%. PET/CT confers significantly higher specificity, positive predictive value as well as accuracy of CT in detecting nodal metastasis. Conclusions: PET/CT fusion images may influence treatment arrangement. PET/CT is much more precise than CT in nodal staging, and is more detailed and precise than CT in finding nodal metastasis but is less sensitive with a higher false-negative rate.","[Su, Lei; Li, Yanhong; Shi, Hongyun; Huo, Ran; Liu, Miaoling; Li, Zhigang; Li, Qian] Hebei Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Radiol, Baoding 071000, Peoples R China; [Yu, Qian] Hebei Univ, Affiliated Hosp, VIP Ward, Baoding 071000, Peoples R China; [Hu, Ling] Hebei Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Oncol, Baoding 071000, Peoples R China","Hu, L (corresponding author), Hebei Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Oncol, Baoding 071000, Peoples R China.",57461548@qq.com,,,,,,2,1,1,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,479.0,484,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_77,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400031,,,,,2022-07-14

Twenty male athletes in a randomized and double-blind design were allocated in two equal supplement and placebo groups (take cranberry soft chews 500mg for 14 days). After supplementation, all participants were participated in bruce test. The blood samples were taken in three phases (before and after the supplementation and after the exercise). This experiment used single cell gel electrophoresis including modified comet assay (with FPG and ENDO III enzymes) to detect the oxidative DNA damage induced by exhaustive exercise in athlete blood cells, and the product 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) of oxdation of DNA, also, the level of MDA, BUN and CK in athlete plasma were observed. The normal data (Mean +/- SD) were analyzed by repeated measure ANOVA, Tukey and independent t-test (P <= 0.05). The results showed that a 14-day cranberry consumption hadn't significant effect on the damage index of modified comet assay (with FPG and ENDO III enzymes) and the level of 8-OHdG and also the level of MDA, BUN and CK in plasma at rest status (P>0.05). However, exercise-induced decrease of 8-OHdG and the value of comet assay and the plasma level of MDA, BUN and CK in the cranberry group were significantly more in comparison with those in the placebo group (P<0.01). Result of the study indicates that 14-day cranberry consumption can reduce the production of lipid oxidation and oxidative DNA damage during exhaustive exercise.","[Su Meihua; Zhang Shuilian] Minnan Normal Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Zhangzhou 363000, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Yang Duoduo] Guizhou Univ Engn Sci, Coll PE & Hlth Sci, Guiyang 551700, Guizhou, Peoples R China","Su, MH (corresponding author), Minnan Normal Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Zhangzhou 363000, Fujian, Peoples R China.",sumh1234@163.com,,,Educational Commission Fujian Province China [2005-B11504],This work was supported by Educational Commission Fujian Province China of Grant No. 2005-B11504.,,37,2,2,0,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,499.0,506,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_81,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400034,,,,,2022-07-14

Considering the effects of vitamin D, it is possible that vitamin D supplement in NAFLD patients with VDD may have significant biochemical and histological benefits. Materials and methods: This study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation on NAFLD patients. Patients with increased liver enzymes with NAFLD diagnosis were enrolled. This clinical trial was conducted in two groups of 20 patients. In control group, only lifestyle modification was performed, but the case group received 50,000 IU vitamin D3 weekly for 12 weeks alongside lifestyle modification. Results: Fibroscan was used to assess the liver fibrosis and steatosis before and after the intervention. The levels of vitamin D and liver enzymes were also assessed in six months. Mean BMI and serum liver enzymes decreased significantly in two groups (p<0.05). At the end of the study a significant improvement was observed in steatosis in both groups when the results were compared with their baseline measures (p<0.05), however, no significant differences were observed between the two groups in steatosis when measured by CAP parameter. Discussion and conclusion: There was no significant improvement in the severity of fibrosis measured by kpa between two groups (p>0.05). A significant improvement was observed in case group in the fibrosis severity. Vitamin D may improve the degree of steatosis and severity of fibrosis in NAFLD patients and be useful in preventing fibrosis.","[Taghvaei, Tarang] Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Imam Khomeini Hosp, Gut & Liver Res Ctr, Dept Gastroenterol, Sari, Iran; [Akha, Ozra] Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Imam Khomeini Hosp, Diabet Res Ctr, Dept Endocrinol, Sari, Iran; [Mouodi, Marjan] Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Imam Khomeini Hosp, Internal Med, Sari, Iran; [Fakheri, Hafez Tirgar; Maleki, Iradj] Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Imam Khomeini Hosp, Gut & Liver Res Ctr, Sari, Mazandaran, Iran; [Kashi, Zahra] Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Imam Khomeini Hosp, Diabet Res Ctr, Endocrinol, Sari, Iran; [Mohammadpour, Rezaali] Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Stat & Epidemiol, Sari, Mazandaran, Iran","Akha, O (corresponding author), Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Diabet Res Ctr, Sari, Iran.",,"Maleki, Iradj/AAY-4649-2020; Taghvaei, Tarang/AAE-5110-2021; Mohammadpour, Reza Ali/F-4279-2017; Fakheri, Hafez Tirgar/G-7638-2017","Maleki, Iradj/0000-0003-2395-8118; Mohammadpour, Reza Ali/0000-0003-2353-5027; Fakheri, Hafez Tirgar/0000-0002-0579-6111","Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran","This study was supported by Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.",,24,5,5,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,415.0,422,,,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400020,,,,,2022-07-14

As a multifactorial disorder, several genetics and environmental factors contribute in its pathogenesis. Among them are genetic variants in the integrin subunit alpha 4 (ITGA4) gene. The encoded protein has been shown to assist in migration of leukocytes across the blood brain barrier participating in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory disorders. Materials and methods: The current case-control association study enrolled 410 unrelated MS patients and 477 healthy matched controls. The rs1143676 within ITGA4 gene, which leads to an arginine to glutamine transversion, was genotyped in all study participants using tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system PCR (T-ARMS-PCR). Results: The rs1143676 polymorphism showed significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies between the MS patients and healthy subjects. In addition, genotypes were risk associated in dominant and codominant models. Conclusion: The rs1143676 polymorphism is associated with MS risk in Iranian population. Future studies are needed to evaluate its significance in MS pathogenesis in other populations. These results are in agreement with the supposed biological role of ITGA4 in immune cell trafficking in the CNS.","[Taheri, Mohammad; Sayad, Arezou; Ghafouri-Fard, Soudeh; Omrani, Mir Davood] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Dept Med Genet, Tehran, Iran; [Taheri, Mohammad] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Urogenital Stem Cell Res, Tehran, Iran; [Noroozi, Rezvan] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Phytochem Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran","Ghafouri-Fard, S; Omrani, MD (corresponding author), Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Dept Med Genet, Tehran, Iran.",s.ghafourifard@sbmu.ac.ir; davood_omrani@yahoo.co.uk,"Sayad, Arezou/AAX-1349-2021; Noroozi, Rezvan/AAG-2134-2020; Ghafouri-Fard, Soudeh/O-7994-2019","Noroozi, Rezvan/0000-0003-2294-171X; Ghafouri-Fard, Soudeh/0000-0002-0223-499X",Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences,The current study was supported by a grant from Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences.,,17,1,1,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,1.0,,,,,83.0,86,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_1_14,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AH,WOS:000424878600014,,,,,2022-07-14

This study aims to explore whether ALDH2 is able to protect NG108-15 neural cells from hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) induced injury through prevention of toxic aldehydes accumulation. Materials and methods: NG108-15 cells were subjected to 5h of hypoxia (H) followed by 20h of reoxygenation (R) to establish H/R injury model. The cells were randomly divided into 6 groups as follows: the control group; the H/R group; the Alda-1 (5 mu M), the Alda-1 (10 mu M) or the Alda-1 (30 mu M) plus H/R group; and the vehicle plus H/R group. To verify the function of ALDH2, the NG10815 cells were subjected to 4-HNE (50 mu M) for 24 h. At the end, culture medium and cells were collected for analysis of cellular apoptosis, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, reactive oxygen species (ROS), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and malondialdehye(MDA) levels, and ALDH2 expression, respectively. Results: It showed an increase in cell necrosis and apoptosis concomitant with down-regulation of ALDH2 expression and activity while accumulation of toxic aldehydes including 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the H/R group. Administration of ALDH2 activator (Alda-1) reduced H/R-induced NG108-15 cells injury accompanied by a reverse in ALDH2 activation and toxic aldehydes accumulation. 4-HNE treatment increased cell necrosis and apoptosis concomitant with down-regulation of ALDH2 expression and activity while an increase in ROS production, all these effects were reversed in the presence of ALDH2 activator. Conclusions: ALDH2 is able to protect neural cells from H/R-induced injury through prevention of toxic aldehydes accumulation and it might serve as a molecular target for the development of novel drugs to treat neurological diseases such as stroke.","[Tan, Bin; Yang, Zhong-Bao; Peng, Jun] Xiang Nan Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Chenzhou 423000, Peoples R China; [Tan, Bin; Ren, Kai-Di; Zhang, Xiao-Jie; Peng, Jun] Cent S Univ, Xiangya Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharmacol, Changsha 410078, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zhong-Bao] HuNan Normal Univ, Affiliated Changsha Hosp, Dept Pharm, Changsha 410006, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Luo, Xiu-Ju] Cent S Univ, Xiangya Sch Med, Dept Lab Med, Changsha 410013, Hunan, Peoples R China","Peng, J (corresponding author), Xiang Nan Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Chenzhou 423000, Peoples R China.",junpeng@csu.edu.cn,"peng, jun/AAA-6751-2022","peng, jun/0000-0001-7536-3613","National Nature Science Foundation of China [81373409, 81573430, 81603107]; Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [2015JJ2156]","This work was supported by National Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 81373409 to Jun Peng, No. 81573430 to Xiu-Ju Luo, No. 81603107 to Zhong-Bao Yang), Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 2015JJ2156 to Xiu-Ju Luo).",,20,0,0,0,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,1.0,,,,,145.0,152,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_1_24,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AH,WOS:000424878600024,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: The 276 patients with mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV treated in our hospital from March 2014 to December 2016 were enrolled in this study. A prospective & retrospective analysis was conducted to estimate probability of death during the course of treatment and summarizes the factors leading to death. Results: During the treatment period, 29 patients died, with odds of 10.51%. Statistical analysis showed that mortality was significantly lower in patients receiving antiviral therapy than those who did not (P < 0.05). In addition, the probability of death occurrence could be reduced with early antiviral therapy. Based on HIV infection route, it could be noted that the mortality of intravenous drug users was significantly higher than patients with sexually transmitted infections (P < 0.05). This could be observed from infection type of mycobacterium tuberculosis, whereby mortality of patients with smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis infection was substantially higher than those with smear negative pulmonary tuberculosis and patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis alone (P < 0.05). Meanwhile the mortality of patients with CD4 + T lymphocyte level> 350 cells/mu l was significantly higher than patients with other cases (P < 0.05). Conclusion: HIV infection route, severity of tuberculosis, antiviral therapy and early treatment are the significant relevant factors that affect the death of patients infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV in the course of anti-tuberculosis treatment. These factors demand severe attention besides symptomatic treatment should be comprehended in all clinical institution to ensure patients' wellbeing.","[Teng, Jiangyan; Fan, Houcui; Zhang, Tao] Linyi Peoples Hosp, Linyi 276034, Peoples R China","Zhang, T (corresponding author), Linyi Peoples Hosp, Linyi 276034, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,20,2,2,1,8,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,1.0,,267.0,271,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_1s_44,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AM,WOS:000424879100009,,,,,2022-07-14

Method: We selected 120 cases of patients suffering from single-level degenerative lumbar spine disorder and treated in our hospital from January, 2012 to January, 2016, and all patients received complete follow-up visit. Before treatment, all patients were averagely divided into two groups based on number table method. Minimally invasive transforaminal interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) was used for treatment on 60 cases in Group A, while traditional transforaminal interbody fusion (TLIF) was used for treatment on remaining 60 cases in Group B. Results: With comparison on operation duration, in-operation blood volume and post-operation drainage volume between two groups of patients, the operation duration of Group A is obviously longer than that of Group B, while the in-operation blood volume and post-operation drainage volume of Group A are distinctly less than these of Group B, and the difference has statistical significance (p<0.05). The VAS score on lumbago and leg pain at 1 week and 8 weeks of post-operation for Group A is significantly lower than that for Group B, and the difference has statistical significance (p<0.05); the VAS score on lumbago and leg pain in six months of post-operation for Group A is slightly lower than that for Group B, and the difference has statistical significance (p<0.05). The ODI functional disability scores under follow-up visit in 2 months, 4 months and 6 months of post-operation for both Group A and Group B are distinctly lower than these of pre-operation, and JOA score is obviously higher than that of pre-operation, so the difference has statistical significance (p<0.05).

The diagnosis is made based on the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (APA), anticardiolipin antibodies (aCLA), lupus anticoagulant (LA), and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibody levels and clinical criteria. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. From time to time, MS and APS can cause diagnostic confusion for clinical and cranial involvement. We aimed to investigate the frequency of APA in patients with and without MS after being admitted for a differential diagnosis of MS. Materials and methods: The laboratory values for vasculitis/MS differential diagnosis for the last 14 months were analyzed in this retrospective cross-sectional study. The patients were categorized into those who were diagnosed as having MS and those who were not (MS-like) based on the McDonald criteria. The patients' APA IgG and IgM antibodies, aCLA IgG and IgM, and LA values were recorded. Correlation regarding the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of the patients with MS was investigated. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Of 125 patients, 42 had MS and 83 had MS-like illnesses. LA was found negative in 21 (50%) patients and positive in 21 (50%) patients in the MS group. LA was found negative in 26 (31%) patients and positive in 57 (69%) patients in the MS-like group. The difference between the groups was statistically significant (p=0.04). There were positive APA values in 1 patient, and positive aCLA values in 3 patients in the MS group, and positive APA values in 3 patients, and positive aCLA values in 4 patients in the MS-like group. This difference between the groups was not statistically significant (p=0.9). There was no correlation found between EDSS and LA in the patients with MS. Conclusion: The prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies in MS is a controversial topic.

The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of using the auriculotherapy technique on stress, anxiety, and depression in MS patients. Materials and methods: This study was a double blind randomized clinical trial in two groups. The sample size was estimated to be 64 subjects in each group. The Center for MS at Kashani hospital in the Province of Isfahan was the location of research. DASS-21 questionnaire were completed before, after and one month after intervention. The auriculotherapy technique began in the intervention group and at the end of each session, herbal vaccaria seeds were fixed at three main points on the ear, for at least 3 days. All the tests were carried out using the SPSS19 software at an error level of 5%. Results: The results showed that the mean score of stress, anxiety and depression decreased in the auriculotherapy group compared with that in the placebo group. The analysis of variance showed significant differences between the two groups after intervention and one month later ( P <0.05). Whereas the stress, anxiety and depression score had not undergone any significant changes before intervention in two groups (P>0.05).

The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) is recommended for determining the malnutrition status of adult individuals. This test is easy to use, and its results are consistent with laboratory data. The purpose of this study is to assess the malnutrition status of patients receiving home health care by using MUST together with laboratory data. Material and methods: This study was conducted between 2013 and 2014 and included 178 patients aged 65 years or older who received home health care. According to the MUST evaluation form, a score of 23.5-30 was considered normal; 17-23.5 was considered to indicate malnutrition risk; and <17 was considered to indicate malnutrition. One-way ANOVA was used for descriptive statistical analysis, and Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) test was used for determining differences between groups. Pearson's chi-square test, Yates' continuity correction test, Fisher's exact test and the Fisher-Freeman-Halton test were used for comparison of qualitative data. The significance level was set at p < 0.05, with a 95% confidence interval. Results: The average age of the subjects participating in the study was 81.19 +/- 8.22 years, and the study group comprised 32% male and 68% female participants. The body mass index values showed that 67.4% of the patients were obese. According to the MUST scores, 12.4% were at moderate risk and 14.6% were at high risk of malnutrition. Over the last 3 months, 16.9% of the patients had lost more than 3 kg of body weight, and 44.9% were dealing with psychological stress or acute illness. In this study population, 33% of the patients could eat their meals without assistance. Further, 45.5% had severe dementia or depression, and 94.9% were on more than three prescription drugs per day. The total protein, albumin, iron, TDBC, ferritin and B12 folic acid levels differed significantly according to the MUST scores (p<0.01), as did the CRP, hemoglobin, cholesterol, HDL, AST and ALT levels (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The results indicate that malnutrition is fairly common in geriatric patients who need health care at home. These patients should therefore extensive laboratory tests and physical examinations for assessing anamnesis and physical and mental functions, and should also undergo screening, specifically for the risk of malnutrition.","[Varol, Aydan Cevik] Community Hlth Ctr, Tekirdag, Turkey","Varol, AC (corresponding author), Community Hlth Ctr, Tekirdag, Turkey.",dracevik@gmail.com,"Varol, Aydan Çevik/AAS-5377-2021",,,,,20,0,0,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,1.0,,,,,169.0,174,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_1_28,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AH,WOS:000424878600028,,,,,2022-07-14

Its increased values are associated with higher risk for cardiovascular disorders and related with Metabolic syndrome (MS). However, the data about the role of copeptin in Pre-metabolic syndrome (PreMS) are scarce. The aim of the study was to compare the copeptin levels in patients with MS, PreMS and in healthy controls and to evaluate the possible correlations between copeptin and cardio-metabolic (CM) factors. Materials and methods: Altogether 82 subjects were investigated and divided in 3 groups: MS (n=33; mean age 57,7 +/- 11,7 years), PreMS (n=26; 56,5 +/- 13,78 years) and controls (n=23; 37,4 +/- 13,56 years). In all patients the following measurements were performed: copeptin concentrations, waist size, body mass index (BMI), lipid profile, fasting blood glucose (FBG). Results: Copeptin levels were found to be significantly higher in both, MS and PreMS groups: 24,56 +/- 10,05 pmol/l and 18,74 +/- 6,4 pmol/l, respectively, versus controls (16,28 +/- 9,16 pmol/l) and its values increased with age in both genders. However, there was no significant difference between the measured copeptin levels in MS and PreMS patients (p>0,017, NS, non-Gaussian distribution). Significant correlations of copeptin values with low density lipoproteins, FBG and presence of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM T2) were obtained in MS group only (in PreMS, p=NS), whereas no relations were found between copeptin and waist size in these two groups. Conclusion: Our results confirmed the reported data for increased copeptin levels in MS, which correlated with the well established risk factors - arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, increased BMI, diabetes mellitus. In PreMS patients copeptin concentrations were comparable to those with MS, suggesting that PreMS could also be associated with increased CM risk by common pathogenetic mechanism, but independently of the abdominal obesity.","[Vasileva, Daniela Georgieva; Runev, Nikolay Margaritov; Manov, Emil Ivanov; Naydenov, Stefan Naydenov] Med Univ, UMHAT Aleksandrovska, Med Fac, Clin Cardiol,Dept Propedeut Internal Med, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Petrova-Nikolova, Daniela Stoychkova; Pencheva-Genova, Ventsislava Pencheva] Med Univ, UMHAT Alexandrovska, Dept Internal Med, Clin Pulmol, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Apostolova, Margarita Dimitrova] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Mol Biol Roumen Tsanev, Sofia, Bulgaria","Vasileva, DG (corresponding author), Med Univ, UMHAT Aleksandrovska, Med Fac, Clin Cardiol,Dept Propedeut Internal Med, Sofia, Bulgaria.",,"Apostolova, Margarita/AAF-2940-2019","Apostolova, Margarita/0000-0001-7188-506X; Naydenov, Stefan/0000-0002-0855-7861",,,,20,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1201.0,1206,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_184,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700006,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: Blood samples were processed by the BACTEC 9120 blood culture system. Species identification was performed using the Vitek-2 system. The drug susceptibility of pathogens was performed using the ATB FUNGUS 3 system. Results: Sixty eight episodes of Gram-positive bacteremias occurred in 51 liver recipients between January 31, 2003 and September 1, 2014. The median time to the onset of Gram-positive bacteremias was 6 days after liver transplantation and 92.6% of Gram-positive bacteremias were early-onset. The most common site of primary infection was intra-abdominal/biliary, followed by lungs. Of these 51 liver recipients with Gram-positive bacteremias, 25 (49%) died. The most common bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (29.4%) and Enterococcus faecium (27.9%). Of these 20 Staphylococcus aureus, 90% were methicillin-resistant. The Gram-positive bacteria were highly resistant to erythromycin, penicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (resistance rate > 80%) and relatively susceptible to glycopeptides and oxazolidone antibiotics (resistance rate < 10%). There were 21 (30.9%) episodes of Gram-positive bacteremias without receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy.

After treatment, a 12-month postoperative follow-up was implemented to observe the recovery, injury recurrence, and postoperative pain. Based on the occurrence of postoperative pain as a critical criterion, patients were divided into a painful group and a painless group to analyze the risk factors for pain. Results showed that after surgery, 1274 out of 1400 patients with knee joint discoid meniscus injury recovered well, indicating an overall effective rate of 91%. The remaining 126 patients were not effectively treated, as they suffered severe postoperative pain after surgery, with a pain occurrence rate of 9%. Through comparison of risk factors, it was found that there were significant differences between the two groups in terms of average age, load bearing time, joint soft bone injury condition, and postoperative cold compress condition (p<0.05). There were no significant differences in terms of their body weights and surgical methods (p>0.05). These findings suggested that using arthroscopy to treat knee joint discoid meniscus injury of basketball players can realize significant therapeutic effect and an increased healing rate. Some patients may be prone to risk factors for postoperative pain, to a certain degree due to their age and previous injury history. To minimize such negative impact of the surgery, target analysis of these risk factors should be conducted in future studies in order to formulate targeted clinical treatment and nursing intervention for better healing.","[Wang, Changyou] Huaihua Univ, Coll Kinesiol & Hlth Sci, Huaihua 418000, Peoples R China","Wang, CY (corresponding author), Huaihua Univ, Coll Kinesiol & Hlth Sci, Huaihua 418000, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,16,0,0,2,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,1.0,,245.0,248,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_1s_40,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AM,WOS:000424879100005,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: Elderly patients (N = 279) with T2DM admitted to the Endocrinology Department of our hospital from September 2015 to August 2017 were randomly selected. They were divided into two ,groups, the high uric acid group (n = 143) and the normal uric acid group (n = 136), according to their blood uric acid level to compare the glycosylated haemoglobin (HbAlc), serum creatinine (Scr), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), beta cell function index (HOMA-beta) and other indices of the two ,groups. Pearson correlation analysis was adopted to summarise the correlation between serum uric acid level, HOMA-IR and HOMA-beta of the patients. Results: HbAlc levels and HDL levels of the high uric acid ,group were lower than those of the normal uric acid group, while other detection indices, including Scr, TC, TG, LDL and BMI were higher than those of the normal uric acid group (p < 0.05). For the elderly patients with T2DM, serum uric acid levels and HOMA-IR were in positive correlation (p < 0.05), but serum uric acid levels had no obvious correlation with HOMA-beta (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Uric acid level is not only one of the independent risk factors for insulin resistance but also the predictive ,factor for T2DM. Therefore, controlling uric acid levels may become an important strategy for improving insulin resistance of elderly patients with T2DM.","[Wang Ping; Duan Luqin] Taian City Cent Hosp, Dept Geriatr, Tai An 271000, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zheng Guanlin] Taian Publ Hlth Sch, Tai An, Shandong, Peoples R China","Wang, P (corresponding author), Taian City Cent Hosp, Dept Geriatr, Tai An 271000, Shandong, Peoples R China.",ja1274@163.com,,,,,,15,0,0,1,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1901.0,1905,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_295,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400046,,,,,2022-07-14

The matricellular protein Cysteine-rich protein 61 (CCN1) plays important roles in several inflammation diseases. However, the role of CCN1 in acute pancreatitis remains unclear. This work was aimed at investigating the protective effect of CCN1 on acute pancreatitis and the potential mechanism. Materials and methods: The AP mouse model was induced by intraperitoneal injection(i.p.) of caerulein. Over-expression of CCN1 was achieved by orbital intravenous injection of CCN1 adenovirus. CCN1 mRNA and protein levels in pancreas were detected by qPCR and western blots. Pancreatic tissue damage was evaluated and confirmed by Hematoxylin and Eosin staining H.&E. and serum amylase activity analysis. Leukocyte infiltration was observed and immunohistochemically stained. Results: Caerulein-induced AP resulted in elevated serum amylase activity (p < 0.05). Histopathologic damage of pancreatic tissue in AP mice was significantly higher than saline group (p < 0.05). Both mRNA and protein levels of CCN1 were decreased in AP group (p < 0.05). Over-expression of CCN1 recovered CCN1 mRNA and protein levels. Pathological damage of pancreatic tissue was reduced in CCN1 over-expression AP group (p < 0.05). Over-expression of CCN1 in pancreas significantly decreases neutrophils effusion but not macrophages in CCN1 over-expression AP mice (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Reduction of CCN1 may be associated with caerulein-induced AP development in mice. Further studies are needed to investigate the effect of CCN1 in AP patients and the biochemical explanations for this phenomenon.","[Wang, Yifan; Ju, Linling; Chen, Lin; Bian, Zhaolian; Shao, Jianguo] Nantong Third Peoples Hosp, Nantong Inst Liver Dis, Nantong 226006, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Diao, Huayu] Nanjing Univ Chinese Med, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [YangWang] Nantong Univ, Sch Med, Nantong 226006, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Shao, JG (corresponding author), Nantong Third Peoples Hosp, Nantong Inst Liver Dis, Nantong 226006, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",shaojianguo4144@163.com,,,Nantong Science and Technology Bureau [MS22015105]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20160420]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [81600449],"This work was supported by Nantong Science and Technology Bureau, (No. MS22015105); The Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Grants NO.

Methods: Rats were randomly divided into normal, model, drug, and acupuncture groups. A post-stroke depression model was made by middle cerebral artery occlusion and chronic unpredictable mild stress. The acupuncture group was treated at Baihui, Fengfu, Shenmen and Taichong points for 20 min. The rats in the treatment group were treated with fluoxetine (2 mg/kg) once a day for 7 days. 3 courses, each course of rest between 1 day. Pathological changes in the hippocampal CA1 region were observed by light microscopy. Ultrastructural changes of the hippocampus were observed by electron microscopy. Levels of seretonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), acetylcholine (Ach), gamma-aminobutyric acid (gamma-GABA) and glutamate (Glu) were measured in the cerebral cortex. 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1A R), NE alpha 2 receptor (NE alpha 2R) mRNAs and proteins were detected by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively, in the hippocampus and raphe nucleus. Results: Compared with the model group, the acupuncture group had a lower Zea Longa score, higher sugar consumption, higher exercise level and greater number of vertical movements in the open field test (P <0.01 or P <0.05). The ultrastructural changes of hippocampal neurons were obvious and the damage to neurons was severe. There were fewer ultrastructural changes in hippocampal neurons in the acupuncture and drug groups compared with those in the model group. After treatment, levels of 5-HTT and 5HT1A R mRNA and protein in the brain tissue of PSD model rats were decreased, and levels of Ach, gamma-GABA, and Glu, and 5-HTT and 5-HT1A R mRNA and protein were significantly higher in the cortex of the acupuncture group compared with those in the untreated group (P <0.01).

Methods: Randomly, we selected a total of 100 elder patients who would undergo general anesthesia in this hospital, and those patients were divided into two groups, i.e. the sufentanil group (n=50) and the fentanyl group (n=50). Respectively, induction in the sufentanil group and the fentanyl group was carried out with sufentanil (0.5 mu g/kg) and fentanyl (4.0 mu g/kg). Items to be observed in this study included the changes in hemodynamics and respiratory functions before induction and 1 min, 5 min and 10 min after intubation, and the variations in blood glucose and norepinephrine in venous blood that was drawn at 1 min after intubation. Results: From 1 min after intubation, the indicators of hemodynamics of patients in the sufentanil group were significantly lower than those in the fentanyl group and the difference had statistical significance (p<0.05), but at 10 min after intubation, no statistically significant difference was identified between two groups (p>0.05); at 1 min and 5 min after administration of drugs, respiratory depression in varying degrees was observed, while the reduction in respiratory rate in fentanyl group was more obvious than that in the sufentanil group, and the difference had statistical significance (p<0.05). However, comparison of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) after intubation between two groups showed no statistically significant difference (p>0.05). At 1 min after intubation, decreases were identified in blood glucose and norepinephrine in the sufentanil group, while in the fentanyl group, these two indicators were elevated, and the differences between two groups had statistical significance (p<0.05). Conclusion: Sufentanil, with less inhibitory effect on respiration, can stabilize the hemodynamics, maintain the stability of circulation system and inhibit the stress response in the induction of general anesthesia for elderly patients. Thus, sufentanil is more applicable to the induction of general anesthesia.","[Xiao, Xing-peng; He, Xuan; Jia, Yi-fan; Ren, Han-lin; Xu, Yan-shu] Wuhan Univ, Renmin Hosp, Dept Anaesthesiol, Wuhan 430060, Hubei, Peoples R China","Xu, YS (corresponding author), Fengcheng Hosp Shanghai Fengxian Dist, Dept Anaesthesiol, 9983 Chuannan Fenggong Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,10,0,0,2,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,889.0,892,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_136,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000040,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods Rats were divided into Sham group, MH group, Model group, NBP group and MH+NBP group. Rats in NBP and MH+NBP group were treated with NBT for 7 days before surgery, and solvent was used in other groups. Rat global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model was constructed using Pulsinelli four-vessel occlusion method. Content of oxidative damage and inflammation related factors were measured using corresponding kit. Neuronal cell damage was detected by Nissl staining. Western blot was used to detect expression of Bcl-2, Bax, mTOR and NF-kappa B proteins. Results: MDA, NO, NOS, IL-6 and IL-1 beta contents and levels of Bax, p-mTOR and p-NF-kappa B proteins were significantly increased and SOD content and expression level of Bcl-2 were significantly decreased in Model group compared with Sham group (p<0.05), while MH, NBP, and MH+NBP significantly inhibited those changes (p<0.05) and the inhibition effect of MH+NBP was the strongest. Numbers of neurons in MH, NBP, and MH+NBP were all increased compared with Model group, while this number was highest in MH+NBP group and showed no significant difference to that of Sham group. Conclusion: MH+NBP played a better role in inhibiting oxidation damage and inflammatory response induced by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion than MH and NBP alone. The mechanism is possibly related to the inhibited phosphorylation of mTOR and NF-kappa B proteins, increase in expression level of anti-apoptotic proteins and decrease in expression level of pro-apoptotic proteins.","[Xie, Kun; Sun, Guoyong; Li, Chuangang; Liu, Xiao] Shandong Univ, Hosp 2, Dept Anesthesiol, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Jingui; Wang, Shuqin] Shandong Univ, Qilu Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, 107 Wenhua West Rd, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hui; Wen, Qing] Shandong Univ, Hosp 2, Blood Purificat Ctr, 247 Beiyuan St, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China","Wang, SQ (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Qilu Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, 107 Wenhua West Rd, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.;Wen, Q (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Hosp 2, Blood Purificat Ctr, 247 Beiyuan St, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.",120382594@qq.com; Shuqinwang2004@163.com,,,,,,30,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1959.0,1965,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_305,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400056,,,,,2022-07-14

From the experimental data, we found that buckwheat flavonoids could ameliorate complications of the rats bearing diabetic nephropathy. After 4 weeks of buckwheat flavonoids administration, the mice exhibited an excellent improvement in blood glucose and kidney index, reduced morphological changes in the renal tissue and normalized the abnormal expression of FOXO1 mRNA. Treatment of buckwheat flavonoids also down-regulated p-Akt and PI3K (p85) proteins level caused by diabetic nephropathy, which indicated the involvement of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the diabetic nephropathy.

Methods: The surgical excision specimens of 70 patients with glioma treated in the hospital from January 2011 to June 2016 were chosen as glioma group, and 20 cases of non-tumor brain tissue were chosen as control group. In glioma group, there were 25 cases of WHO grade II, 25 cases of grade III, 20 cases of grade IV, and the patients were divided into 2 groups: low-grade glioma group (grade II) and high-grade glioma group (III + IV). Immunohistochemical method was used to determine the expressions of ADAM17, EGFR and Ki-67 in the pathological specimens, and all the patients were followed up after surgery to record the survival time. Results: The positive expression rates of ADAM17, EGFR and Ki-67 in the control group and the brain glioma group were significantly different. Among them, the positive expressions of ADAM17, EGFR and Ki-67 in low-grade glioma group were 56.0% (14/25), 48.0% (12/25) and 20.0% (5/25), respectively, and the positive expressions of ADAM17, EGFR and Ki-67 in high-grade glioma group were 97.8% (44/45), 84.4% (38/45) and 86.7% (39/45), respectively. The positive expressions of ADAM17, EGFR and Ki-67 increased significantly with increase in malignancy (p < 0.05). All patients were followed up in order to record survival time, and it was found that within 3 years, the survival rate of ADAM1 negative and positive patients were 75.0% and 31.0%, respectively; the 3 years survival rates of EGFR negative and positive patients were 65.0% and 28.0%, respectively, and the 3 years survival rates of patients with Ki-67 negative and positive were 80.8% and 20.5%, respectively. The 3 years survival rates of ADAM1, EGFR, Ki-67 negative and positive groups were significantly different. The high expression of ADAM1, EGFR and Ki-67 suggested poor prognosis. Conclusion: ADAM17, EGFR and Ki-67 are closely related to the malignant degree of glioma.

Methods: Gene expression microarray chips were used to identify genes that were differently expressed in colorectal cancer and adjacent normal tissues. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to validate microarray results. Furthermore, gene oncology (GO) and pathway analyses were conducted for clustering of these differentially expressed genes. Results: About 1072 genes were differentially expressed between cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues (P <= 0.05, Fc> 2.0), in which 435 genes were upregulated and 637 genes were downregulated. Three up-regulated genes (KRT23, TGFBI, and MYC) and one downregulated gene (DPHA7) were selected and confirmed using qRT-PCR, which was consistent with that of microarray analysis. These genes were further classified into 71 groups based on their functions using GO and pathway analysis. KEGG analysis of these upregulated or downregulated genes revealed that a total of 23 signalling pathways were involved. Conclusion: This study preliminarily screened key genes and the signalling pathways that are closely associated with colorectal cancer development, yet subsequent gene function studies are still required to verify these findings. These four key genes, which are closely related with the development of colorectal cancer, could interfere with tumour development.

Many patients with sepsis caused by abdominal infections, but no clinical study on whether these patients should receive ventilation strategies has been reported. This study aims to investigate the effects of different mechanical ventilations on patients with sepsis in the abdominal cavity. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on data obtained from 296 patients with sepsis in the abdominal cavity, who were admitted in our hospital, in order to evaluate the effects of mechanical ventilations with different tidal volumes. Carbon dioxide partial pressure, oxygenation index and mean airway plateau pressure at different time points after mechanical ventilation, the tracheal extubation rate within two hours after surgery, the incidence of atelectasis within 24 hours after surgery, and mortality within 28 days after surgery were compared between the two groups. Results: Differences in the basic situations of patients upon entering the operating room between the two groups were not statistically significant. At 10, 30 and 60 minutes after mechanical ventilation, and at the end of the operation, differences in arterial blood pH value, oxygenation index, extubation rate within two hours after surgery, and the incidence of atelectasis within 24 after surgery between the two groups were not statistically significant (P>0.05). Ventilation was obviously excessive and airway plateau pressure was higher in group 1, while patients had mild CO2 retention in group 11; and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Furthermore, differences in the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome and 28-day mortality between the two groups were statistically significant (P=0.04). Conclusion: Lung protective ventilation can reduce the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome and 28-day mortality.","[Xu, Yue-Ming; Peng, Chun-Yu; He, Zhi-Gang; Wang, Shun-Hong; Tian, Hai] Peoples Liberat Army, Dept Anesthesiol, Hosp 324, Chongqing 400020, Peoples R China","Xu, YM (corresponding author), 324 PLA Hosp, Master Dept anesthesiol, 29 East Rd Janxin, Chongqing 400020, Peoples R China.",xuyueming_111@163.com,,,,,,26,0,0,1,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1697.0,1702,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_259,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400010,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: Gefitinib (R) - resistant cells strain HCC827 GR were exposed gradually to increasing concentrations of Gefitinib (R), and the IC50 value of the drug was determined by MTT assay. The Cx43 mRNA expression was measured using RT-PCR, while the protein and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) levels were determined with Western blot. Immunofluorescence technique was used for the analysis of the Cx43 cells. Results: The IC50 values of Gefitinib (R) for HCC827 and HCC827 GR were 0.075 +/- 0.013 and 10.67 +/- 0.027 mu mol/L, respectively, and differed significantly (p < 0.05). The expression levels of mRNA and protein of Cx43 in HCC827 GR were significantly lower than those of HCC827 (p < 0.05), while the protein level of p-Akt was significantly increased (p < 0.05). When LT294002, the specific inhibitor of PI3K was added to HCC827 GR, the protein expression level of p-Akt was significantly reduced (p < 0.05), while that of Cx43 was significantly increased (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The down-regulation of Cx43 in the cytoplasm of patients with NSCLC is associated with acquired resistance of NSCLC cells to Gefitinib (R), most likely due to the activation of PI3K / Akt signal pathway of Cx43 non-GJIC-dependent. Thus, measurement of levels of Cx43 is a useful guide during the treatment of NSCLC.","[Xue-Mei, Xia; Dian-Ming, Li; Jun-Feng, Hu; Yong, Zhang; Shan, Gao] Bengbu Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Bengbu, Anhui, Peoples R China","Dian-Ming, L (corresponding author), Bengbu Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Bengbu, Anhui, Peoples R China.",yxogy6@163.com,,,,,,9,0,0,1,12,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,4.0,,,,,1037.0,1040,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4_158,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ1AT,WOS:000434986500021,,,,,2022-07-14

The clinical, etiology, anatomy, pathophysiology classification (CEAP) is a frequently used classification for CVD. Patients with varicose veins are classified as CEAP class C2. Veno-active drugs (VAD) such as Calcium Dobesilate or Micronised Purified Flavonoid Fraction of Diosmin (MPFF) reduce the symptoms of pain associated with CVD. However, although the effectiveness of VAD is well established, it is controversial. The aims of the this study were to compare the efficacy of two VAD (Calcium dobesilate and MPFF in the treatment of CVD in view of the intended visual analogue scale (VAS) and duplex scanning (DS) changes such as measuring great saphenous vein (GSV) diameter. Materials and methods: A total of 24 patients who had no prior VAD treatment with CEAP class C2, with no family history of CVD were treated; 12 received calcium dobesilate and 12 received MPFF for 60 days. Comorbidities such as hypertension (HT) and diabetes mellitus (DM) were examined. Before and after treatment period, the patients were investigated with DS for diameter of GSV and pain complaint according to VAS were recorded. Results: There were no difference in treatment groups in terms of age, gender, or the comorbidities. For the whole groups, no significant differences were recorded before and after treatment regarding DS parameters. On the other hand, pain was significantly reduced for the group 1 and 2 according to VAS (respectively p=0,04,p=0,03). Conclusion: In this study, pain was reduced in both groups, but no improvement was observed in DS findings. The role of VAD in treatment of patients with CVD needs to be improved in the existing recommendations.","[Yalvac, Emine Seyma Denli; Gursel, Sidika; Aydin, Ebuzer] Medeniyet Univ, Fac Med, Dept Cardiovasc Surg, Istanbul, Turkey; [Demiroglu, Murat] Medeniyet Univ, Fac Med, Dept Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, Istanbul, Turkey","Demiroglu, M (corresponding author), Gortepe Egitim Ar Hastanesi, Istanbul, Turkey.",drmuratdemiroglu@gmail.com,"Aydın, Ebuzer/AAR-2100-2020; Yalvac, Emine Seyma Denli/AAJ-5545-2020","Yalvac, Emine Seyma Denli/0000-0003-0629-660X",,,,24,2,2,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,657.0,661,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_101,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000006,,,,,2022-07-14

The results show that among 5,450 respondents, 429 were diagnosed with gallstone, with incidence rate at 7.87%; moreover, among university faculty members, female members have a significantly higher risk of suffering from gallstones than male members, with statistical value in difference, P <0.05. Diagnosis results of gallstone patients were compared with those of respondents without gallstone, showing that serum cholesterol (TC), serum low density lipoprotein (LDL-C), serum triglyceride (TG) of gallstone patients were higher than those of respondents without gallstone, while serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) of gallstone patients was significantly lower than that of respondents without gallstone. It can thus be concluded that hyperlipidemia patients are more likely to have gallstone disease. In order to improve health level of university faculty, the clinical prevention of gallstone should be strengthened, and gallstone patients should be guided to give up unhealthy living habits and do more exercise.","[Yan, Shengguang] North China Univ Sci & Technol, Int Educ Ctr, Tangshan 063000, Peoples R China; [Seo, Jaebok] Jeonju Univ, Dept Educ, Jeollabuk Do 55069, South Korea; [Zhang, Jinyang] Jeonju Univ, Dept Business Adm, Jeollabuk Do 55069, South Korea; [He, Lijuan] Kailuan Gen Hosp, Dept Hepatobiliary Surg, Tangshan 063000, Peoples R China","He, LJ (corresponding author), Kailuan Gen Hosp, Dept Hepatobiliary Surg, Tangshan 063000, Peoples R China.",anthonyyan2005@163.com,,,,,,19,0,0,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1783.0,1786,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_273,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400024,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: A total of 152 patients were recruited for this study, and they were divided into two groups: acute leukemia group and control group. There were 100 patients in the acute leukemia group which comprised 51 males and 49 females within the age range 17-66 years (mean age = 36.77 +/- 5.61 years). Based on the classification criteria for FAB, there were 56 cases with acute myeloid leukemia and 44 cases with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The control group consisted of 52 patients with non-hematological malignancies within the same period. The expressions of p53, bcl-2 and bax genes in the two groups of patients were measured using immuno-histochemical staining. Results: The positive expressions of p53, bcl-2 and bax genes in the control group were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those of the acute leukemia group. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in the expressions of these genes between the AML and ALL groups. There were significant differences in the expressions of p53, bcl-2 and bax genes between the different FAB typing of AML. No significant differences were seen in the expressions of p53, bcl-2 and bax genes between the different FAB types of ALL (p. 0.05). The effective positive expressions of p53, bcl-2 and bax genes in patients with acute leukemia were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those of control. Conclusion: These results suggest that mutant p53, bcl-2 and bax participate in the onset of acute leukemia, and are associated with its clinical characteristics such as typing and chemotherapeutic efficacy. Thus, they may be used as markers in the treatment and prognosis of acute leukemia.","[Yan, Yan; Ying, Tian] Capital Med Univ, Beijing Chao Yang Hosp, Dept Hematol, 8 Gong Ti South Rd, Beijing 100020, Peoples R China","Yan, Y (corresponding author), Capital Med Univ, Beijing Chao Yang Hosp, Dept Hematol, 8 Gong Ti South Rd, Beijing 100020, Peoples R China.",vc1208@163.com,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1391.0,1395,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_212,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700034,,,,,2022-07-14

Besides, the effect of IL-6 on restoration of injured muscle tissue was also analyzed. In view of this, the study was conducted by splitting forty-eight adult male New Zealand rabbits into three groups referred as Xiaotong strapping, voltaren and control group.. Each group was further subdivided into 4th-week and 5th-week group, each containing 8 rabbits. The animals were provoked with high-voltage and low-current stimulatorin order to initiate them to run and jump. At the end of training, different topical drugs were given to 4th-week and 5th-week voltaren and Xiaotong strapping groups. After a week of drug administration, medial head of left leg gastrocnemius muscle of these New Zealand rabbits were selected and kept in paraformaldehyde solution. The morphological changes in muscle tissue were deduced from the H&E stained and immunohistochemical images of IL-6 expression in cells. The expression of IL-6 in skeletal muscle cells showed a tendency to increase with the extension of training duration. Results obtained shows that the use of topical traumatic drugs could decrease inflammatory cytokines of exercise-induced chronic skeletal muscle injury. In addition, expression of IL-6 in muscle cell towards exercise-induced chronic skeletal muscle injury could be effectively decreased.","[Yan, Zhenggang] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wuhan 430064, Hubei, Peoples R China","Yan, ZG (corresponding author), Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wuhan 430064, Hubei, Peoples R China.",13317151696@163.com,,,University Provincial Teaching Reform Research Project in Hubei Province [2013160],The project is supported by University Provincial Teaching Reform Research Project in Hubei Province (No. 2013160).,,13,0,0,14,21,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,1.0,,239.0,243,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_1s_39,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AM,WOS:000424879100004,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: The 112 patients with volleyball-induced thoracolumbar fractures treated in our hospital from June 2014 to December 2015 were selected as the subjects. Thoracolumbar injury classification and severity (TLICS) score was evaluated according to the individual injury, neurological function and integrity of posterior ligament complex. The treatment plan was determined according to the score. There were 17 cases with score minus 4 points, who were treated with conservative treatment; 70 cases with score above 4 points, who were treated with surgical treatment; for those with score equal to 4 points, 16 cases received surgical treatment and 9 cases received conservative treatment according to individual circumstances. The anterior vertebral height, cobb angle and oswestry disability index (ODI) were compared before and after the treatment. And excellent rates of surgical treatment and conservative treatment were compared. Results: All patients were followed up for 12-24 months. As can be seen from the results, after treatment, cobb angle, anterior vertebral height were significantly improved on the average for the 112 patients, with P <0.05 in comparison before and after the treatment, so there is a statistical significance; ODI score results showed that excellent rates were 88.46% (23/26) and 90.69% (78/86) respectively for conservative treatment and surgical treatment, so the two regimens provide good therapeutic effect, with difference P> 0.05, and there is no statistical difference.

Methods: Literature published from January 2014 to December 2017 on the relationship between TLR4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile gene polymorphisms, and AP in case-control studies were retrieved. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed statistically. Publication bias of included literature was evaluated, and sensitivity analysis and meta-analysis were performed. Results: A total number of 15 studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 467 AP patients and 3412 control cases. The analysis showed absence of any obvious publication bias in symmetrical funnel plots. In allele models (G/A versus C/T), TLR4 gene polymorphism increased the risk of AP (P < 0.05). Gene polymorphisms in Thr399Ile and Asp299Gly also increased the risk of AP (P < 0.05). In codominance models (GG/AA versus CC/TT), TLR4 gene polymorphism, as well as Thr399Ile and Asp299Gly gene polymorphisms increased the risk of AP (P < 0.05).

Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a marker of platelet activation and function. Method: 204 children were included in this study in three ,groups; healthy children aged 3 - 48 months (control, group, Group 2), patients diagnosed with acute bronchiolitis in our clinic and then hospitalized (severe cases, group 1b) and patients diagnosed but not hospitalized (mild cases, Group 1a). Patients with a history of asthma, chronic disease or congenital anomaly were excluded. The clinical severity of acute bronchiolitis and the relations with WBC, CRP and MPV were compared between the groups. Results: Mean MPV values were 7.4 +/- 1.5 fL (4.6-10.3) in Group 2; 7.8 +/- 0.7 fL (6.5-10.1) in Group la and 8.3 +/- 1.0 fL (6.311.2) in Group 1b.While no difference was observed in terms of MPV between Group 2 and Group 1a(p=0.23), a significant difference was determined between Group 2 and Group 1b (<0.001). Discussion: MPV values in our study differed only in the severe patient group. In addition, no difference was observed between the mild and severe case groups in terms of other parameters apart from MPV. This finding shows that MPV values are correlated with severity of disease, that they rise significantly in moderate-severe cases and that they can therefore be used as a finding to assist clinicians in assessing the severity of the disease.","[Yildiz, Yasin; Cakmak, Semiha; Calapoglu, Tugba] Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Rize, Turkey; [Hocoglu, Zeynep I.; Karadeniz, Elif G.] Rize Publ Hosp, Dept Pediat, Rize, Turkey","Yildiz, Y (corresponding author), Rize Training & Res Hosp, Rize, Turkey.",yasinyildizmd@gmail.com,"yildiz, yasin/AAE-2806-2019; Yildiz, Yasin/AAG-7802-2021","Yildiz, Yasin/0000-0002-0602-7795",,,,21,0,0,2,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1997.0,2000,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_311,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400062,,,,,2022-07-14

Method: C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into 5 groups: blank control group (ctrl), high fat diet group (HFD), low, medium and high concentration of rutin intervention group (Rutin-L, Rutin-M, Rutin-H). Mice in ctrl group were fed with normal diet, and mice in HFD and rutin intervention groups were both fed with high fat diet. Then different dose of rutin treated was in Rutin-L, Rutin-M and Rutin-Hgroups while saline was used in ctrl and HFD groups. Histopathological changes of the liver were observed by hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E) staining. Blood and liver biochemical indicators were measured through non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and insulin detection kit. HOMA-IR and adipo-IR were calculated from the belowed equation. RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of insulin resistance-related genes, such as PPAR-alpha, IR, IRS-1 and SREBP-1c mRNA. The expression of oxidative stress, inflammatory factors and MAPK pathway related factors in liver tissue were detected by Western-blot test. Result: The results indicated that rutin decreased HOMA-IR and Adipo-IR significantly (p<0.05). The medium and high doserutin treatment could inhibit the abnormal expression of IR, IRS-1, PPAR-a and SREBP-1c mRNA. In addition, the western blot results suggested that expression of HO-1, Nrf2, GSS and SOD2 were down-regulated while KEAP1 was up-regulated by rutin against insulin resistance. Also, some inflammatory factors (TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6) were inhibited by rutin treatment. Meanwhile, P-JNK and p-ERK expression in the regualtion of MAPK signal pathways was also reduced markedly after rutin administration (p<0.05). Conclusion: Therefore, these finding suggested that rutin can improve the insulin resistance induced by high fat diet by the way of MAPK signaling pathway, and thus could be a potential agent against insulin resisitance.","[Yu, Wenjuan; Xie, Yanrong; Bing, Leilei; Yu, Fengyun] Yantai Hosp Tradit Chinese Med, Dept Endocrinol, 39 Xingfu Rd, Yantai 264001, Shandong, Peoples R China","Yu, FY (corresponding author), Yantai Hosp Tradit Chinese Med, Dept Endocrinol, 39 Xingfu Rd, Yantai 264001, Shandong, Peoples R China.",yfyun0976@126.com,,,,,,25,2,2,1,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,677.0,683,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_104,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000009,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: Gallbladder cell-Shandong (GBC-SD) of over-expression MUC16 and empty viral plasmid-transfected cells were produced through slow virus transfection system. The effect of MUC16 on proliferation of GBC-SC cells in vitro was determined using 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Scratch test and Transnell chambers were used to measure the effect of MUC16 over-expression on in vitro cell migration and invasion. The effect of MUC16 overexpression on GBC-SD cell adhesion was determined with adhesion test, while real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to ascertain the pathway involved in MUC16-induced regulation of GBC-SD cell biology. Results: The growth rate of MUC16 over-expression cells was significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0.05). MUC16 over-expression increased the migration, scratch recovery, and extracellular matrix ( ECM) adhesion abilities of GBC-SD cells in vitro. MUC16 significantly enhanced the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and MMP7 mRNAs, relative to control (p < 0.05). Conclusion: MUC16 enhances the proliferation, invasion and migration of gallbladder carcinoma cells in vitro by activating the PI3K/Akt signal pathway.","[Zeng Guoxiang] Peoples Hosp Hanchuan City, Dept Gen Surg, Hanchuan 431600, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang Cheng; He Lili; Wang Mei; Li Xin] Second Peoples Hosp Jingmen Hubei Prov, Dept Gen Surg, Jingmen, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Tian Mi] Jingmen Publ Secur Bur, Forens Identificat Inst, Jingmen, Hubei, Peoples R China","Li, X (corresponding author), Second Peoples Hosp Jingmen Hubei Prov, Dept Gen Surg, Jingmen, Hubei, Peoples R China.",ph1349@163.com,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1641.0,1646,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_253,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400004,,,,,2022-07-14

Business intelligence visual analytics tools like dashboards can be used to navigate, manipulate, and convert such big data into actionable knowledge. The combined use of clinical dashboards with MS registries can provide near real-time surveillance to improve patient outcomes when appropriately configured. The first step for dashboard development is to determine its key performance indicators (KPIs). Method: This qualitative study was conducted in 2017. Interviews with neurologists for requirement analysis was performed after studying the MS registries' aims and indicators in leading countries. The face and content validity and also reliability of the questionnaire were assessed by expert's opinions and Cronbach's alpha, respectively. In order to make a consensus about dashboard KPIs, Delphi technique was applied. Results: A set of 45 KPIs was developed for the MS surveillance registry dashboard and categorized into three layers-country layer, regional layer, and patient layer-with 7, 28, and 10 indicators, respectively, in each layer. Conclusion: The first step to develop the MS surveillance registry dashboard is to determine its key performance indicators. KPIs serve as a mind map for collecting key data for dashboard visualization. These indicators provide a framework for performance measurement and create the basis for quality assurance and quality improvement of MS care.","[Zeraatkar, Kimia; Ahmadi, Maryam] Iran Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth Management & Informat Sci, Dept Hlth Informat Technol, Hlth Informat Management, Tehran, Iran; [Sahraian, Mohammad Ali] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Neurosci Inst, Business Inst MS Res Ctr, Neurol, Tehran, Iran; [Sahraian, Mohammad Ali] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Neurosci Inst, Business Inst MS Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran","Ahmadi, M (corresponding author), Iran Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth Management & Informat Sci, Dept Hlth Informat Technol, Hlth Informat Management, Tehran, Iran.",,", maryam/AAP-6423-2021; zeraatkar, kimia/ACN-7271-2022",", maryam/0000-0003-0765-9556; zeraatkar, kimia/0000-0003-1563-9213",Iran University of Medical Sciences [IUMS/SHMIS-2015/16],This study was part of a PhD thesis supported by Iran University of Medical Sciences (IUMS/SHMIS-2015/16).

To date, although many loci, including genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been identified as risk variants of T2D, only approximately 10% of its heritability can be explained. In the current study, we proposed a data processing and analysis procedure to more accurately evaluate the association of the pathogenesis of T2D with copy number variations (CNVs). Methods: The data in our study came from the WTCCC (Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium) genome-wide CNV database. Individual CNVs were identified by SW-ARRAY and CBS algorithms and genotyped with a global threshold method. Overlapped CNVs among all samples were split into smaller but more accurate CNV segments (CNVSegs) after the CNV call; then, LASSO-based logistic regression models with 10-fold cross-validations were performed 100 times to examine the association of CNVSegs with T2D. The AUC (area under the curve) in every model was summarized to preliminarily verify the classification ability of the models. Results: After quality control, 1,813 T2D cases and 2,777 controls were enrolled in the study. A total of 65,163 CNVs were identified, of which 25,512 were identified in the T2D group and 39,651 were identified in the healthy control group. A total of 22,279 CNVSegs were constructed after pre-processing the raw CNV data. By means of fitting 1,000 logistic regression models with the LASSO method, 26 CNVSegs were identified as T2D-associated CNVSegs according to pre-defined criteria (Frequency > 85% & Length > = 50 bp). Twenty-seven protein-coding genes were found to be overlapped with the CNVSegs, of which 11 were verified to be relevant to T2D, obesity or metabolic syndrome based on current published evidence. The average AUC of all models was 0.611 with the maximum being 0.683. Conclusions: Our study explored T2D-associated CNVSegs by LASSO-logistic regression models from the perspective of the whole genome for a more complete understanding of the genetic mechanisms of T2D. Further studies are necessary to verify the influence of the susceptibility loci on the pathogenesis or progression of T2D among different populations.","[Zhang, Wei; Qin, Guoyou; Zhao, Naiqing] Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wei; Ying, Jun] Fudan Univ, Fudan Univ Lib, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Ji, Yuan] Northshore Univ HealthSyst, Evanston, IL 60201 USA; [Ji, Yuan] Univ Chicago, Med & Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Huang, Caihong] Xuhui Cent Hosp, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Ye, Zhengqiang] Fudan Univ, Eye & ENT Hosp, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China","Qin, GY; Zhao, NQ (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.",gyqin@fudan.edu.cn; nqzhao@fudan.edu.cn,,,NIH [2R01 CA132897],YJ's research is partly supported by NIH 2R01 CA132897.,,37,0,0,0,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,4.0,,,,,1143.0,1149,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4_176,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ1AT,WOS:000434986500039,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: Literature published from 2001 to date on the relationship between protein expression of Hh signaling pathway and HPV16 infection in cervical cancer was retrieved from databases such as PubMed, Embase, Medline, CNKI and Wanfang. The data were screened and collated independently by two evaluators. Thereafter, the data were subjected to meta-analysis using RevMan5.2 analysis software after the evaluation of risk of bias. Results: Ten published works were included in this study. These consisted of 520 cases of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) and 642 cases of cervical carcinoma (CC). The meta-analysis showed that in the Hh signaling pathway, the expression of sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein in CC group was significantly higher than that in CIN group (OR = 0.22; 95 % CI = 0.16, 0.31; P < 0.00001); the positive expression of HPV16 in CC group was higher than that in CIN group (OR = 0.26; 95 % CI: 0.16, 0.43; P < 0.00001), and the positive expression of Shh protein in HPV16 positive group was higher than that in HPV16 negative group (OR = 4.95; 95 % CI: 2.34, 10.43; P < 0.00001).

Method: A total of 122 patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who received emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were included. fQRS analysis was performed using 12-lead surface electrocardiogram (ECG) on the next day after surgery. Those results were combined with TIMI flow grade and TIMI myocardial perfusion (TMP) scoring for the infarcted artery immediately after PCI. Ultrasonic cardiogram (UCG) was performed one week after surgery. Results: Based on the results of surface ECG, fQRS was more frequent among patients with lower TMP scores. Compared with patients without fQRS, thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) scores and ejection fraction (EF) of the coronary artery decreased significantly in patients with fQRS (P<0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that fQRS was negatively correlated with EF of the left ventricle; TMP scores and good myocardial reperfusion was negatively correlated with fQRS. Conclusion: fQRS is closely associated with myocardial ischemia in patients with acute myocardial infarction, and can be used as a simple and non-invasive method for the evaluation of myocardial reperfusion.","[Zhu, Hongjun; Ding, Xiaomei; Xu, Jian; Su, Hao; Yan, Ji] Anhui Med Univ, Dept Cardiovasc Internal Med, Anhui Prov Hosp, 17 Lujiang Rd, Hefei 230001, Anhui, Peoples R China","Ding, XM (corresponding author), Anhui Med Univ, Dept Cardiovasc Internal Med, Anhui Prov Hosp, 17 Lujiang Rd, Hefei 230001, Anhui, Peoples R China.",dingxiaomei-1209@163.com,,,Foundation from the health department of Anhui province [1501ld04017],This work was funded by a Foundation from the health department of Anhui province (No: 1501ld04017),,9,1,1,1,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,781.0,784,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_119,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000024,,,,,2022-07-14

Stroke may be the first manifestation of the syndrome. Materials and methods: We report a 72-year-old Chinese male developed recurrent cerebral infarction with four events in one month, despite therapy with three kinds of antithrombotics and atorvastatin. Brain magnetic resonance imagine (MRI) showed progressive multiple infarcts, involving the anterior and posterior circulation in two hemispheres of the brain. A whole body positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) showed sigmoid carcinoma and tumor metastasis. He was finally diagnosised with sigmoid carcinoma and Trousseau syndrome. Similar medical literatures are reviewed. Results: Ischemic stroke is a common brain lesion in patients with cancer and occasionally is its initial presentation. The widely accepted etiology is related to hypercoagulability though multiple mechanisms are believed to be involved. Elevated plasma levels of D-dimmer have been found in some cancer-related stroke but not all. Low-molecular-weight heparin is considered to be the first-choice agent for controlling thrombosis associated with Trousseau syndrome. Controling over the cancer may help to control the thrombosis. Conclusion: Malignancy should be paid more attention in cryptogenic stroke, particularly in cases of frequently recurrent cerebral infarction. The case of frequent recurrence of cerebral infarction in trousseau has rarely been reported.","[Zhu, Jiting; Tang, Qingxi; Cai, Bin] Fujian Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Neurol, 20 Chazhong Rd, Fuzhou 350005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jiting; Tang, Qingxi; Cai, Bin] Fujian Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Inst Neurol, 20 Chazhong Rd, Fuzhou 350005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jianglong] Jinjiang City Hosp Tradit Chinese Med, Dept Neurol, Quanzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China","Cai, B (corresponding author), Fujian Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Neurol, 20 Chazhong Rd, Fuzhou 350005, Fujian, Peoples R China.;Cai, B (corresponding author), Fujian Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Inst Neurol, 20 Chazhong Rd, Fuzhou 350005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",caibin@fjmu.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of China [81171114, 81571133]; Fujian Provincial Medical Project for Middle-aged and Young Talents [2014-ZQN-ZD-18]; Fujian Provincial Natural Science Foundation [2015J01392]","This work was partly supported by grant No. 81171114 (BC), 81571133 (BC) of Natural Science Foundation of China, grant No. 2014-ZQN-ZD-18 (BC) of Fujian Provincial Medical Project for Middle-aged and Young Talents, and grant No. 2015J01392 (BC) of Fujian Provincial Natural Science Foundation.",,11,0,0,0,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1727.0,1729,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_264,,3,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400015,,,,,2022-07-14

Chemokines may control the macrophage infiltrate found in many solid tumors. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) plays a key role in the recruitment and activation of monocytes during inflammation. MCP-1 is a small chemotactic protein that has been found in several kinds of tumor tissue samples and functions as a key regulator of cancer progression. This study was conducted to investigate the serum levels of MCP-1 in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA) and the relationship with tumor progression and known prognostic parameters. Materials and methods: Thirty-five patients with PA were investigated. Serum samples were obtained on first admission before any treatment. Both serum MCP-1 levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Age and sex matched 32 healthy controls were included in the analysis. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 61 years, range 38-84 years; 21 patients were men. The tumor was located in the head of the pancreas in 24 (69%) patients. The most common metastatic site was liver in 20 patients with metastasis (n= 18, 90%). Forty-four percent of 18 metastatic patients who received palliative chemotherapy (CTx) were CTx-responsive. The median follow-up time was 24 weeks (range: 1-191 weeks). At the end of the observation period, twelve (34%) patients experienced disease progression and twenty-three patients (66%) were dead. Median progression-free survival and overall survival of the whole group were 13.7 +/- 2.3 weeks (95% confidence interval (CI) = 9-18 weeks) and 48.0 +/- 12.8 weeks (95% CI = 23-73 weeks), respectively. The baseline serum MCP-1 levels were significantly higher in patients with PA than in the control group (p=0.02). Moreover, serum MCP-1 levels were significantly higher in the patients with low albumin ant platelet levels (p=0.04 and p=0.05, respectively). However, serum MCP-1 assays had no prognostic roles on outcome. Conclusion: MCP-1 is an auspicious biomarker which plays a functional role in PA. Although serum levels of MCP-1 were found to have diagnostic value, no predictive and prognostic value was determined in PA patients.","[Afsar, Cigdem Usul] Istanbul Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Karabulut, Mehmet; Alis, Halil; Binboga, Sinan] Istanbul Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Gen Surg, Istanbul, Turkey; [Karabulut, Senem; Aykan, Nuri Faruk] Istanbul Univ, Inst Oncol, Dept Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Bilgin, Elif] Istanbul Univ, Inst Oncol, Dept Basic Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey","Afsar, CU (corresponding author), Istanbul Educ & Res Hosp, Kasap Ilyas Mah,Org Abdurrahman Nafiz Gurman Cad, Istanbul, Turkey.",,"karabulut, senem/AAT-3594-2020; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/C-3436-2015; Aykan, Nuri Faruk/I-6425-2019; Alis, Halil/AAJ-6721-2020; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/AAA-6103-2021; Doğru, Elif Bilgin/A-6543-2018","Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639; Aykan, Nuri Faruk/0000-0002-5472-3218; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639; Doğru, Elif Bilgin/0000-0003-0077-7939",,,,36,2,2,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,3.0,,,,,501.0,507,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_3_075,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EV3BF,WOS:000401631200023,,,,,2022-07-14

The purpose of this study was to identify the methods and dimensions of data quality assessment in the HIS. Method: A review of literature discussing data quality dimensions and assessment methodology for HIS was performed. The relevant publications were identified in major databases. Data quality dimensions and its assessment methods were extracted by using content analysis method. Results: The dimensions and methods of data were observed to be most frequently assessed. Among a total of 50 dimensions of data quality, 11 are categorized as the main dimensions. Completeness, timeliness, and accuracy were the three most-used dimensions and element presence, gold standard, and log review were the most-used methods for assessing these dimensions, respectively. The major quantitative assessment methods were descriptive surveys, whereas the main qualitative assessment methods were interview and documentation review. Conclusion: There is currently little consistency or potential generalizability in the dimensions and methods used to assess HIS data quality. Generally, qualitative and quantitative methods were used to assess data quality in the reviewed publications. Thus, because of the inconsistency in dimensions' definition and assessment methods, categorization of data quality dimensions in the format of the limited main dimensions and identification of its assessments methods seemed necessary.","[Ahmadi, Maryan] Iran Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth Management & Med Informat Sci, 6 Rashid Yasemi st,Vali e asr Ave, Tehran, Iran","Ahmadi, M (corresponding author), Iran Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth Management & Med Informat Sci, 6 Rashid Yasemi st,Vali e asr Ave, Tehran, Iran.",m_ahmadi24@yahoo.com,", maryam/AAP-6423-2021; Alipour, Jahanpour/J-9360-2017; alipour, jahanpour/Q-7958-2017",", maryam/0000-0003-0765-9556; Alipour, Jahanpour/0000-0002-8139-1140; alipour, jahanpour/0000-0002-8139-1140",Iran University of Medical Sciences,This study was funded by the Iran University of Medical Sciences.,,75,9,9,4,36,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,2.0,,,,,313.0,320,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_2_047,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2RK,WOS:000397230700022,,,,,2022-07-14

Diabetes mellitus contains a group of metabolic disorders that are in common in terms of appearance characteristic of hyperglycemia. Micro-albuminuria of urine albumin amounts 30-300mg/24h and the higher values are for diagnostic diabetic nephropathy. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between Phase angle and micro-albuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients with a history of more than 5 years of the disease in the city of Ilam. Materials and methods: This is an analytical-practical case-control study and statistical society includes two case and control groups with an average age 52.06 +/- 6.69 years in case group and 50.02 +/- 5.42 years in the control group. The sample size in each group has been designated equal to 50 and data analysis is performed using SPSS and parametric and Non-parametric statistical methods and the related tests. Conclusion: The average Ph. A was obtained equal to 5.87 +/- 1.42 in the case group and 7.29 +/- 0.355 in the control group which statistically significant relationship exists between the two groups in Ph. A value (P<0.000). Average micro-albuminuria was 67.32 +/- 75.92 in the case group and 0.276 +/- 0.147 in the control group which there was a significant relationship statistically between the amount of micro-albuminuria within the both groups (P< 0.000). Discussion: By investigation of the relationship between ph. Angle and micro-albuminuria in diabetic patients it can be concluded that the amount Ph. A reduces with the increase of micro-albuminuria and by increasing micro-albuminuria, the variables of overall body water volume, intracellular water and extracellular water relatively increase and fat mass relatively decreases.","[Ahmadi, Mohammad Reza Hafezi] Ilam Univ Med Sci, Dept Pathol, Ilam, Iran; [Javedani, Mojgan] Iran Univ Med Sci, Shahid Akbarabadi Hosp, Res & Clin Ctr Gynecol & Fertil, Tehran, Iran; [Ghiasi, Bahare] Ilam Univ Med Sci, Dept Nephrol, Ilam, Iran; [Ghavam, Samiramis] Ilam Univ Med Sci, Dept Cardiol, Ilam, Iran","Ghavam, S (corresponding author), Ilam Univ Med Sci, Fac Med, Dept Cardiol, Ilam, Iran.",,"hafeziahmadi, mohammadreza/D-4095-2017; hafeziahmadi, mohammadreza/AHE-7465-2022","hafeziahmadi, mohammadreza/0000-0002-8085-9856; hafeziahmadi, mohammadreza/0000-0002-8085-9856",,,,9,5,5,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,2.0,,,,,351.0,357,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_2_052,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2RK,WOS:000397230700027,,,,,2022-07-14

About the effect of cigaratte smoking on treatment results of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, although there are only a limited information in several studies, as it is found that there is no study to investigate effects of smoking in various frequencies in means of decibel difference. We specifically evaluated hearing loss in different frequencies by examining the differences pre and post therapy between smokers and non smokers. This study is thought to be a first in this field. Material and methods: This is a prospective study. Patients with pathology in magnetic resonance imaging, diagnosed vascular disease and diabetes mellitus, and patients over 65 years of age or under 18 years of age, patients who admitted to the hospital after 4 days and who received medical treatment before were excluded. Total of 72 patients were included in the study and divided into two groups as smokers and non-smokers. Whether patients had or didn't have vertigo, degree of tinnitus, audiogram characteristics, 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 4000 Hz, 8000 Hz hearing tresholds and pure tone averages were recorded before and after treatment. Results: No statistically significant difference found between groups in terms of age, sex differences, treatment start time, presence of vertigo and the degree of tinnitus. No significant between-group differences found in pre-treatment hearing tresholds, post-treatment hearing tresholds and hearing gains after treatment. Conclusion: The effect of the smoking on recovery for each different frequency of hearing tresholds was not studied before. According to our results we are sharing the opinion that says smoking is not a risk factor or prognostic factor for sudden hearing loss. This can also be said for each different frequencies of hearing treshold.","[Akil, Ferit] Diyarbakir Selahaddin Eyyubi Publ Hosp, Otolaryngol Clin, Diyarbakir, Turkey; [Ayral, Muhammed; Toprak, Serdar Ferit] Diyarbakir Gazi Yasargil Educ & Res Hosp, Otolaryngol Dept, Diyarbakir, Turkey; [Yollu, Umur] Gumushane Publ Hosp, Otolaryngol Clin, Gumushane, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Mehmet; Yener, H.

The virus is transmitted to people by vectors such as ticks. Despite how little is known about the disease's pathophysiology, management of the clinical period, and developments in treatment, it is known that proinflammatory parameters and cytokines are important in the pathophysiology and clinical follow-up of viral hemorrhagic diseases with fever. Among these, the number of platelets, neutrophils, and lymphocytes is important in diagnosis and clinical follow-up. There is a lot of information concerning how low platelet number is directly related to mortality and survival. Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a parameter showing platelet activation and function; therefore, it is a significant finding showing platelet maturation. For that reason, it can be claimed that platelet activation plays an important role in CCHF. Materials and methods: A total of 209 patients who were diagnosed as CCHF between May 2010 and September 2015 and whose lungs were examined during admission were retrospectively involved in the study. The patients' demographic features, clinical findings and follow-ups, laboratory findings, radiological examinations of lung, and surveys were retrospectively examined. Results: The 209 cases involved in the study consisted of 127 male (60.8%) and 82 female (39.2%) patients. Mean age was as 52 +/- 18 years. Ferritin, procalcitonin, and CRP, which are related to inflammation, were high compared to the normal reference range, too. Mean platelets and leukocytes in hemogram were 56.200/mu L +/- 44.800 and 3.070/mu L +/- 2.930, respectively. Average MPV values in nonsurvival and survival groups were 11.50 fL +/- 2.74 fL and 10.44 fL +/- 2.40 fL, respectively. Conclusions: The comparison of MPV between the survival and nonsurvival groups was found to be statistically significant (p<0.05) in CCHF. MPV can be used as a new and important clinical follow-up parameter for clinical observation of patients diagnosed with CCHF in terms of both survival and radiological findings.","[Aktas, Turan] Gaziosmanpasa Univ, Sch Med, Pulmonar Med Dept, Tokat, Turkey; [Aktas, Fatma; Ozmen, Zafer] Gaziosmanpasa Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Tokat, Turkey; [Ozmen, Cansel] Gaziosmanpasa Univ, Sch Med, Dept Clin Biochem, Tokat, Turkey; [Kaya, Turan] Tokat State Hosp, Infect & Clin Microbiol Dept, Tokat, Turkey; [Demir, Osman] Gaziosmanpasa Univ, Sch Med, Dept Stat, Tokat, Turkey","Aktas, T (corresponding author), Gaziosmanpasa Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pulm Med, Tokat, Turkey.",,,,,,,14,2,2,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,2.0,,,,,183.0,190,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_2_026,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2RK,WOS:000397230700001,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: Seventy-two patients with early breast cancer who admitted to our outpatient clinic were included in the study. Before and after chemotherapy, the anthropometric measurements and bioelectrical impedance analysis with TANITA device, body compositions, serum ADMA and ET-1 levels were recorded. Results: There was a statistically significant increase of serum ADMA levels (112.10 +/- 52.24 ng/ml vs. 206.34 +/- 128.02 ng/ml, p<0.001) after chemotherapy. On the other hand, the decrease of serum ET-1 levels was not statistically significant (2.19 +/- 6.65 vs. 1.68 +/- 3.71, p=0.57). ADMA levels was similar in both of the groups treated with anthracycline or anthracycline plus taxane regimens. There was no relationship between serum ADMA levels and disease stage/grade, hormone or nodal status. The changes in body composition and antropometric measurements were not statistically significant. Conclusion: The increased serum levels of ADMA could be caused by the oxidative stress, apoptosis and endothelial dysfunction secondary to chemotherapy and the decreased estrogen levels. The decrease in serum ET-1 levels might be due to the inhibition of cell proliferation and angiogenesis due to adjuvant chemotherapy.","[Akyol, Murat] Manisa State Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Manisa, Turkey; [Kara, Mete; Alacacioglu, Ahmet; Kucukzeybek, Yuksel; Yildiz, Yasar; Bayoglu, Vedat; Yildiz, Ibrahim; Salman, Tarik; Varol, Umut; Oflazoglu, Utku; Taskaynatan, Halil; Gumus, Zehra] Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Izmir, Turkey; [Demir, Leyla] Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Biochem, Izmir, Turkey; [Ellidokuz, Hulya; Tarhan, Mustafa Oktay] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Inst Oncol, Izmir, Turkey; [Kucukzeybek, Betul] Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Pathol, Izmir, Turkey","Alacacioglu, A (corresponding author), Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Med Oncol Clin, TR-35360 Izmir, Turkey.",,"akyol, murat/AAV-5418-2021; DEMİR, LEYLA/ABH-5523-2020; Yildiz, Ibrahim/AAF-9885-2019; Ellidokuz, Hülya/Q-4049-2019; yildiz, ibrahim/C-9144-2014","akyol, murat/0000-0003-0886-3559; Ellidokuz, Hülya/0000-0001-8503-061X; ",,,,50,1,1,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,557.0,564,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_081,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700002,,,,,2022-07-14

Nandrolone is one of the most abused AAS in the world, it has a similar structure and chemical characteristic compared to testosterone. It interacts with different receptors in our body, such as estrogen, progesterone and testosterone, that's why Nandrolone side effects affect the whole human body. Differents proteins and genes are involved in testosterone biosynthesis of testosterone, with different regulatory pathways. In this review we focused on nandrolone related male reproductive system damage, in order to show the heavy consequences of AAS abuse. Nandrolone regulates MMP-2 and it could lead to spermatogenesis impairment. Oxidative stress and increase of Ros production could play a leading role in Nandrolone related infertility. Different oncogenic pathways are activated by Nandrolone and more studies need to be done to clear up correlations between this molecule and cancer. Leydig cell testosterone production is influenced by Nandrolone, moreover it was demonstrated to be a dose-dipendent mechanism, despite multiple proteins and genes involved in this process were discovered, other regulatory proteins, genes and pathways, need to be studied in deep.","[Albano, Giuseppe Davide; Sessa, Francesco; Bertozzi, Giuseppe; Maglietta, Francesca; Salerno, Monica] Univ Foggia, Sect Forens Pathol, Clin & Expt Med Dept, Osped Colonnello DAvanzo, Viale Aviatori 1, I-71100 Foggia, Italy; [Messina, Antonietta; Monda, Vincenzo] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Expt Med, Naples, Italy; [Giugliano, Pasquale] UOC, Legal Med, St Anna & San Sebastiano Hosp, Palasciano St, Caserta, Italy; [Vacchiano, Giuseppe] Sannio Univ, UOC, Dept Law Econ & Math Methods, Benevento, Italy; [Gabriella, Marsala] Azienda Osped Univ, Struttura Complessa Farm, Osped Riuniti Foggia, Foggia, Italy","Salerno, M (corresponding author), Univ Foggia, Sect Forens Pathol, Clin & Expt Med Dept, Osped Colonnello DAvanzo, Viale Aviatori 1, I-71100 Foggia, Italy.",,"Messina, Antonietta/AHH-2383-2022; Sessa, Francesco/G-1754-2018; Bertozzi, Giuseppe/AAS-9882-2020; MESSINA, ANTONIETTA/K-9366-2016; SALERNO, MONICA/AAC-1321-2019","Messina, Antonietta/0000-0001-8343-432X; Sessa, Francesco/0000-0003-0357-8791; Bertozzi, Giuseppe/0000-0002-8179-1072; SALERNO, MONICA/0000-0002-6410-3960; Monda, Vincenzo/0000-0002-6083-5814; Giugliano, Pasquale/0000-0002-3633-8893; Maglietta, Francesca/0000-0001-7240-5902",,,,68,13,13,1,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,939.0,946,,,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500007,,,,,2022-07-14

One suitable method for inducing salinity resistance is osmolytes production increase in plants. In this study, biosynthetic gene which produces osmolyte manitol (mtlD gene) was transferred to Brassica napus L. to increase salinity tolerance. AGLO1 strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying pBH21 transformation vector, containing mtlD and nptII (transformed plant selectable marker) gene were used for transformation of SLM046 cultivar of B. napus L. Hypocotyl explants were utilized for regeneration of canola plants. PCR analysis of transgenic plants depicted a resemblance in the observed band size and expected band of 500 and 680 bp for the nptII and mtlD genes, respectively. Extracted DNA of transgenic plants, just the same as extracted plasmid containing mtlD gene, revealed a colored blot on a positively charged nylon membrane, while wild-type plants revealed no colored blot. Transformation efficiency was 4.7%. Tolerance threshold against NaCl in wild type and transgenic seeds germination were 250 and 350 mM of NaCl. Thus, Gene transformation into B. napus L. led to the synthesis of mannitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase that improves its salinity tolerance ability.","[Ali, Fakheri Barat; Heidari, Forouzan] Univ Zabol, Fac Agr, Dept Plant Breeding & Biotechnol, Zabol, Iran","Ali, FB (corresponding author), Univ Zabol, Fac Agr, Dept Plant Breeding & Biotechnol, Zabol, Iran.",fakheri@uoz.ac.ir,,,,,,56,1,1,1,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,,,,1.0,,935.0,943,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1s_140,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV8ZR,WOS:000424877000009,,,,,2022-07-14

Exposure to triggering agents may lead to unregulated passage of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the intracellular space, resulting in an acute malignant hyperthermia crisis. Mortality from malignant hyperthermia in the United States was 16.9% in 2001 and 6.5% in 2005, but it is characterized by high morbidity.

Sixty female patients with T2DM and seventeen healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Fasting plasma samples were obtained from the patient and control groups. Trace elements were studied using an atomic absorption spectrometer. Correlation analyses of trace elements with metabolic parameters were analyzed using Spearman's Rho correlation coefficient. T2DM patients had a significantly high fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), and microalbuminuria levels (p< 0.05). Serum magnesium levels were significantly lower in patients with T2DM compared with the healthy controls (2.0 +/- 0.2 ng/mL vs. 2.3 +/- 0.2 ng/mL, p< 0.05). Serum copper levels showed a negative correlation with diabetes duration (r= -0.338, p= 0.011), and iron levels were negatively correlated with body mass index and C-reactive protein (r= -0.407, p= 0.009; r= -0.390, p= 0.017). Serum magnesium levels indicated a correlation with HbA1C and creatinine clearance (r= -0.371, p= 0.049; r= -0.462, p= 0.023), but no significant correlation was found with any of the other variables and zinc levels. The present study found low levels of magnesium, iron, copper, and zinc in women with T2DM, which supports a close relationship of the above trace elements with glucose metabolism.

For both groups the mean age, BMD, T-scores, BMI, osteopeniaosteoporosis rates, concordance-discordance rates and the rates of the regions with lower T-scores were obtained and compared. Results: Osteopenia and osteoporosis were more frequent in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women (P < 0.05). Minor discordance rates were 26.3% (n = 62/236) in premenopausal women and 42.4% (n = 300/708) in postmenopausal ones (P < 0.05), whereas major discordance rates were 0% (n = 0/236) and 2.5% (n = 18/708), respectively (P < 0.05). In discordant cases of postmenopausal group, the rate of lumbar regions with lower T-scores was statistically higher than those of premenopausal group (P < 0.05).

We investigated relationship between insulin resistance and ABO/Rh blood group systems, which has not been investigated before. Material and method: In the present study, medical files of patients who applied to outpatient clinics of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Internal Medicine and Diabetes at Kayseri Training and Research Hospital between dates September 2010 and March 2015, and who had been studied for, but not diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, were retrospectively evaluated. Among patients, those with HOMA-IR >= 2.5 were accepted as having insulin resistance, and enrolled in the study. Patient whose blood groups were recorded in the hospital records or blood groups were determined later during control visits. The control group composed of healthy individuals who applied to the same hospital. Results: When compared with the control group, blood type A was significantly higher in patients with insulin resistance (p=0.022). The adjusted p value was 0.264 when Bonferroni correction was used. Blood type O group was also determined less significantly higher in patients with insulin resistance (p=0.055). The adjusted p value was 0.060. No significant difference was determined in blood types B and AB (p=0.49 and 0.12, respectively). Blood type A Rh (+) was 45.2% in patients with IR whereas 37.2% in the control group (p=0.030, adj. p=0.360). Blood type 0 Rh (+) was significantly higher in the control group (p< 0.001, adj. p< 0.001). Conclusion: These data suggest that individuals with blood type A are more directly related with insulin resistance, while those with type O are less directly related with insulin resistance in Turkish population.","[Aykas, Fatma; Kolagasi, Oykun] Antalya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Hematol, Antalya, Turkey; [Avci, Deniz; Arik, Ferhat; Cetinkaya, Ali; Ozen, Mustafa; Oguz, Arzu; Uslu, Emine] Kayseri Training & Res Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Kayseri, Turkey; [Unal, Aydin] Univ Erciyes, Dept Nephrol, Kayseri, Turkey; [Arik, Bade Erturk] Univ Erciyes, Dept Family Practice, Kayseri, Turkey","Arik, F (corresponding author), Kayseri Training & Res Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Kayseri, Turkey.",,"Oguz, Arzu/W-8004-2019","Oguz, Arzu/0000-0001-6512-6534",,,,22,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,987.0,990,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_156,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500015,,,,,2022-07-14

Given the importance of the use of physical restraints in the ICUs, the present systematic review was conducted in order to determine the prevalence of physical restraint use in the ICUs. Materials and methods: Related papers on restraint use in the ICUs published from 2000 to 2016 were included in this study by searching the national and international scientific databases. Based on Farsi and English keywords searching, and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, final 22 papers from 17 countries were selected for the meta-analysis. The data were analyzed by using Stata Software Version 12.0. The index of heterogeneity among different studies was determined using Cochran (Q) and I2 tests. Results: The present systematic review study includes 22 related articles. The prevalence of physical restrains use varied from 7% in the study by Elliott with a sample size of 569 patients in general ICUs in Australia to 87% in Curry's study with a sample of 26 patients in a surgical ICU in the United States. According to the results of the meta-analysis, the prevalence of physical restrains use was estimated to be 46.7% (CI 95%: 34.7-58.6) in the ICUs. Conclusion: As there is a widespread use of physical restraints in the ICU, it is necessary that hospital managers plan appropriately to reduce the use of physical restraints and whereby its complications and to increase adequately the knowledge, attitudes of ICU nurses towards physical restraint of patients and its affecting factors so that they adhere to the guidelines of this method of care properly.","[Azizpour, Mahtabeh] Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Student Res Comm, Sari, Iran; [Moosazadeh, Mahmood] Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Hlth Sci Res Ctr, Sari, Iran; [Esmaeili, Ravanbakhsh] Univ Med Sci, Orthoped Res Ctr Mazandaran, Nasibeh Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Sari, Iran","Esmaeili, R (corresponding author), Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Med Surg Nursing Dept, Nasibeh Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Vesal Shirazi St, Sari, Iran.",,"moosazadeh, mahmood/F-3730-2017","moosazadeh, mahmood/0000-0002-5452-514X",,,,44,9,10,6,42,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,1.0,,,,,129.0,136,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1_020,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2PY,WOS:000397226800020,,,,,2022-07-14

Monitoring the emergence and transmission of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains permits the elucidation of the source of infection and routes of bacterial transmission. The aim of the present study was an in silico comparison of Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with different schemes of Multiple Locus Variable-number Tandem Repeat Analysis in terms of discriminatory power and concordance. Materials and methods: 58 P.aeruginosa whole genomes have been analyzed in silico to determine SpeI-digested PFGE type and subspecies types using different MLVA methods. Resolution power, strength and direction of the concordance between typing methods have been estimated by calculation of the Simpson's index, the adjusted Rand and the adjusted Wallace coefficients. Results: The Simpson's indices of diversity were 1.0 for PFGE and from 0.995 to 0.999 for MLVA schemes with 6-19 markers. The congruence between PFGE and different MLVA methods measured by the adjusted Rand index were from 0.306 to 0.665 on cluster level for PFGE and type level for MLVA. The congruence was slightly higher at the clonal cluster level-from 0.46 to 0.694. Conclusion: Our in silico study for comparing different MLVA schemes with PFGE, based on Pseudomonas aeruginosa genomes showed, on the one hand, the same high level of discriminatory power of PFGE and MLVA even with 6 tandems markers; nonetheless, on the other hand, there was moderate/poor congruence (no more 70%) between PFGE and MLVA schemes on cluster level.","[Babenko, Dmitriy; Turmuhambetova, Anar] Karaganda State Med Univ, Karaganda, Kazakhstan; [Sandle, Tim] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Pestrea, Sorina Anamaria] Clin Hosp Psychiat & Neurol Brasov, Brasov, Romania; [Moraru, Dan; Chesca, Antonella] Clin Hosp Pneumophtysiol Brasov, Brasov, Romania; [Chesca, Antonella] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania","Chesca, A (corresponding author), Clin Hosp Pneumophtysiol Brasov, Brasov, Romania.",,"Babenko, Dmitriy/AAW-9907-2020; Sandle, Tim/D-4572-2015","Sandle, Tim/0000-0002-8304-8274",,,,27,4,4,1,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,607.0,612,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_090,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700011,,,,,2022-07-14

The aim of our study is to assess the occupational exposure to HBV infection, in the HCWs of the Emergency County Clinical Hospital Tirgu Mures, Romania. Materials and methods: The study was conducted retrospectively on a sample of 524 HCWs, between January 2010 and December 2014, who accidentally came into contact with blood or other body fluids from patients admitted in the Emergency County Clinical Hospital Tirgu Mures, Romania. We persuaded the source patients for the following markers: HBsAg, HCVAb and the HCWs for the following markers: HBsAg, HBsAb, HCVAb, HIVAb. Depending on the tests results and after subjects has given their consent for vaccination and counseling, vaccination was planned at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. Results: The annual rate of HBV infections occurring in health care workers ranged from 0.78% to 2.88%. The highest proportion of occupational work exposure occurred among physicians (41.6%) and nurses (32.44%). The HCWs working in surgical departments, reported the highest occupational work exposure (44.85%). The adherence to follow-up decreased significantly from the 1 month scheduled serological testing, to the 3 and 6 months testing (p< 0.0001). Conclusion: Educational programs, implementation and adherence to more safety precautions for HCWs will help to decrease the frequency of occupational work exposure. Administration of hepatitis B vaccine to HCWs early in their careers can prevent HBV infection associated with occupational work exposure.","[Bacarea, Anca; Costea, George Claudiu] Univ Med & Pharm, Dept Pathophysiol, Targu Mures, Romania; [Romila, Aurelia] Univ Dunarea de Jos, Fac Med, Dept Clin Med, 1 Vadu Sacalelor St,Bl Pescarus,Ap 8, Galati, Romania; [Romila, Aurelia] Galati Cty Hosp, Clin Geriatr Dept, Targu Mures, Romania; [Petrisor, Dana Valentina; Bacarea, Vladimir] Univ Med & Pharm, Med Res Methodol Dept, Targu Mures, Romania; [Bui, Lucia] Emergency Cty Hosp, Surveillance & Control Nosocomial Infect Dept, Targu Mures, Romania","Romila, A (corresponding author), Univ Dunarea de Jos, Fac Med, Dept Clin Med, 1 Vadu Sacalelor St,Bl Pescarus,Ap 8, Galati, Romania.",,"Bacarea, Anca/AAW-9459-2020",,,,,18,1,1,1,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,1.0,,,,,17.0,21,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1_002,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2PY,WOS:000397226800002,,,,,2022-07-14

Diclofenac(DCF) as a non-steroidal pharmaceutical has been detected in water and wastewater samples more than other compounds due to high consumption and limited biodegradability. The disastrous event of a reduction in the number of vultures due to kidney damage following feeding on the corpse of domestic animals contaminated with DCF and the high bioaccumulation capacity of this drug in the tissue of organisms indicate the significance of this compound as a potential contaminant. Materials and methods: In this study, advanced Nano-Fenton process (ANF) was applied to remove DCF from aqueous solutions. The full factorial design was applied using R software (3.1.0) to optimize variables. DCF residual concentration was determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography device and the degree of mineralization was determined through TOC analysis. Results: The mean DCF removal efficiency under different operational conditions and at the time of 1-10 min was obtained to be about 83%. With the increase in the time and H/F along with the reduction in initial concentration of the drug, the response variable (DCF removal) increased. Conclusion: Our research showed that ANF can be considered as a quick and efficient process for the removal of DCF from wastewater with a significant amount of mineralization.","[Bagheri, Amin; Mahvi, Amir Hossein; Nabizadeh, Ramin; Dehghani, Mohammad Hadi; Mahmoudi, Babak; Yaghmaeian, Kamyar] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Mahvi, Amir Hossein; Yaghmaeian, Kamyar] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Inst Environm Res, Ctr Water Qual Res, Tehran, Iran; [Dehghani, Mohammad Hadi] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Inst Environm Res, Ctr Solid Waste Res, Tehran, Iran; [Nabizadeh, Ramin] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Inst Environm Res, Ctr Air Pollut Res, Tehran, Iran","Yaghmaeian, K (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Engn, Tehran, Iran.;Yaghmaeian, K (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Inst Environm Res, Ctr Water Qual Res, Tehran, Iran.",kam.yaghmaeian@gmail.com,"Akbari-adergani, Behrouz/M-4260-2018","dehghani, mohammad hadi/0000-0001-7516-8885; nabizadeh, ramin/0000-0002-6798-7474","Center for Water Quality Research, Institute for Environmental Research, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran [94-01-46-28790]","This research has been financially supported by the grant (Project No: 94-01-46-28790) from the Center for Water Quality Research, Institute for Environmental Research, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.",,20,6,6,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,5.0,,,,,879.0,883,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_5_131,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FA9PC,WOS:000405777000025,,,,,2022-07-14

MicroRNA (miRNA) dysregulation in HCC results in inhibition of cellular apoptosis, increased angiogenesis, invasion and development of metastasis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of serum miRNA-26, miRNA-122 and miRNA-192 levels in diagnosis of HCC compared to other prognostic criteria. Materials and methods: The study included newly diagnosed HCC patients (n=42) and patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as controls (n=45). We measured serum miRNA-26, miRNA-122 and miRNA-192 levels for each patient. Results: Serum levels of miRNA-26 were significantly lower in HCC patients (29.03) than those in control group (30.34) (p<0.001). There was no significant difference in serum levels of miRNA-122 between the two groups (p=0.181). MiRNA-192 was not expressed as assessed by the real-time PCR method. For diagnosis of HCC, cut-off value was set at 29.38 for miR-26. With this cut-off value, sensitivity was 71.4%, and specificity was 82.2%, while positive and negative predictive values were 78.9% and 75.5%, respectively (p<0.0001). We also compared the miRNA-26 and miRNA-122 levels of patients with other diagnostic, clinical and prognostic data, which are significant for HCC. No statistically significant correlation was found between alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and miRNA122 and miRNA-26 gene expressions. Conclusions: Serum levels of miRNA-26 may contribute to early diagnosis of HCC when used together with other diagnostic, clinical and prognostic markers.","[Balkan, Ayhan; Guelsen, Murat Taner] Gazi Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Gaziantep TR-27310, Turkey; [Kaya, Buenyamin] Gazi Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Gaziantep TR-27310, Turkey","Balkan, A (corresponding author), Gazi Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Gaziantep TR-27310, Turkey.",,,,Scientific Research Fund by Gaziantep University [BAP- TF.UT.16.07],All authors thank to Scientific Research Fund by Gaziantep University for their financial support (Project no.

The purpose of this research is Studying the possible protective effect of GCSF against teratogenic effects of Phenobarbital in mice fetus. Method: 120 mg/kg of Phenobarbital within GCSF in different doses was injected to the mice on 9th day of gestation. Their fetuses were then brought out of uterus on 15th day of gestation and were examined by microscopic and macroscopic methods. Findings: Although it was observed that 1.63 mu g/mL of GCSF amended the cleft palate in mice fetus (P<0.05), other doses of GCSF (3.25, 7.75, 12, 15 mu g/mL) yielded no difference in the cleft palate occurrence or its amendment in mice fetus. Results: The results of the present study showed that GCSF may have the teratogenicity effects of Phenobarbital in cleft palate and will prevent its occurrence.","[Bovand, Tannaz; Mousavi, Zahra] Islamic Azad Univ, Pharmaceut Sci Branch, Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol,IAUPS, Tehran, Iran; [Vatanpour, Hossein] Med Sci Univ Shahid Beheshti, Sch Pharm, Toxicol & Pharmacol Dept, Tehran, Iran","Vatanpour, H (corresponding author), Med Sci Univ Shahid Beheshti, Sch Pharm, Toxicol & Pharmacol Dept, Tehran, Iran.",,"Mousavi, Zahra/AAO-3117-2021","Mousavi, Zahra/0000-0001-6524-491X","Toxicology and Pharmacology Lab., School of Pharmacy, Medical Science University of Shahid Beheshti, Tehran, Iran","The authors thank the Toxicology and Pharmacology Lab., School of Pharmacy, Medical Science University of Shahid Beheshti, Tehran, Iran for supporting this project.

In order to increase public awareness and to promote fundraising, a charity activity known as the Ice Bucket Challenge (IBC), initially started only as a joke, was launched in July and August 2014, by Pete Frates, ex Boston College baseball player and himself suffering from ALS. Immediately, it became viral among social media and social network users, worldwide. We used Google Trends (GT) and accessed to Wikipedia page to document interest towards ALS 2 years after the IBC. In coincidence with the IBC initiative, a peak in web queries could be noticed, as well as a burst in daily accesses to Wikipedia page. However, this increase in web activities (+450% for GT) was characterized by a brief memory and a short half-life: before and after IBC initiative, GT-based RSVs were 18.2 +/- 1.7% and 17.8 +/- 1.9%, respectively. Despite alleged claims of the effectiveness of social networks-based campaigns, apart from money donation and a temporarily burst of web queries and accesses to specialized web-sites, before and after the IBC the level of web-related activities has remained practically constant. The direct involvement of scientists and stakeholders, besides that of celebrities and famous people, would be of crucial importance. Only in this way, initiatives such as the IBC could turn from mere entertaining events even though money-attracting into real educational moments. Otherwise, they would be other missed opportunities.","[Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Barberis, Ilaria] Univ Genoa, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Sci, Genoa, Italy; [Martini, Mariano] Univ Genoa, Sect Hist Med & Eth, Dept Hlth Sci, Genoa, Italy; [Igwe, Stanley C.] Fed Teaching Hosp, Dept Neuropsychiat, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, Nigeria; [Vecchio, Ignazio] Univ Catania, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Catania, Italy; [Tornali, Cristina] Univ Catania, Dept Biomed & Biotechnol Sci, Catania, Italy; [Licata, Marta; Borromeo, Federica] Univ Insubria, Dept Biotechnol & Life Sci, Varese, Italy; [Cardinale, Adelfio Elio] Italian Soc Hist Med, Varennes, PQ, Canada; [Adawi, Mohammad] Bar Ilan Univ Safed, Israel Fac Med Galilee, Dept Internal Med, Ziv Med Ctr Safed, Safed, Hazafon, Israel; [Brigo, Francesco] Franz Tappeiner Hosp, Dept Neurol, Merano, Italy","Martini, M (corresponding author), Univ Genoa, Dept Hlth Sci DISSAL, Largo R Benzi 10,Pad 3, I-16132 Genoa, Italy.",,"PAN, ZEQIANG/X-6341-2018; Adawi, Mohammad/ABG-4428-2021; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi/G-1672-2011; Brigo, Francesco/H-6513-2013; Tornali, Cristina/M-5187-2017","Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi/0000-0001-8409-868X; Vecchio, Ignazio/0000-0001-5942-1908; Brigo, Francesco/0000-0003-0928-1577; Tornali, Cristina/0000-0002-1722-5498",,,,20,1,1,3,21,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,5.0,,,,,875.0,878,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_5_130,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FA9PC,WOS:000405777000024,,,,,2022-07-14

These diseases cause cytokine storm and trigger extreme hyperferritinemia, thus they are called hyperferritinemic syndromes. Case presentation: We present a case of a 55-year-old female who had fever, rash and arthralgia. She was admitted to the Hospital of Infectious Diseases in Warsaw with SIRS initially attributed to bacterial infection and suspicion of sepsis. During diagnostic management the patient developed overwhelming SIRS with hyperferritinemia. Broad-spectral antibiotics with short course of steroids were administered for the suspected autoimmunological syndrome. The response to treatment was quick. None syndromes met diagnostic criteria. After vancomycin infusion the second exacerbation appeared with acute kidney injury. Methylprednisolone pulses provided improvement. The patient met HLH criteria a few days after the second exacerbation. Slow, complete remission was achieved with immunosuppressive therapy (steroids and methotrexate). MAS was recognized due to AOSD. Conclusion: The clinical presentation of patients with SIRS is nonspecific. They require thorough assessment because similar symptoms may occur in other several non-infectious conditions, such as autoimmune or hematological disorders.","[Bursa, Dominik; Paciorek, Marcin; Porowski, Dawid; Bednarska, Agnieszka] Med Univ Warsaw, Dept Adults Infect Dis, Warsaw, Poland; [Bursa, Dominik; Paciorek, Marcin; Porowski, Dawid; Bednarska, Agnieszka] Hosp Infect Dis, Warsaw, Poland","Bursa, D (corresponding author), 7-6 Lecha St, PL-05400 Otwock, Poland.",,,,"Research Development Foundation in Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Warsaw, Poland","Paper is partially supported by Research Development Foundation in Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Warsaw, Poland",,13,1,1,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,569.0,573,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_083,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700004,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: A total of 100 retired elderly males were enrolled in this study. All the elderly males performed the incremental load aerobic exercise using cycle ergometer. The physiological parameters of the candidates such as the biological age, body shape, cardiovascular and pulmonary function were measured before and after the exercise. Based on the gap between the biological age and the actual age, the 100 cases of elderly males were divided into pro-senescence group (50 cases) and delaying senescence group (50 cases) for comparative study. Results: Before the aerobic exercise was carried out, the elderly males possessed larger biological age as compared to their actualage, however, the difference was not statistically significant (P> 0.05). The elderly males who completed the aerobic exercise showed smaller biological age than the actual age, with P< 0.05. Moreover, the pro-senescence group had a larger biological age than their actual age before they performedaerobic exercise. However, after the aerobic exercise was executed, the result indicates that their biological age was close to their actual age but was lower than that of their actual age before accomplishing the aerobic exercise was accomplished (P < 0.05). On the other hand, the biological age of delaying senescence group was smaller than the actual age. In comparison to the biological age of candidates before experienced the aerobic exercise, the biological age of the candidates after aerobic exercise was lower. After aerobic exercise, when P> 0.05, the pro-senescence group exhibited smaller waist and larger waist-to-hip ratio; as P < 0.05, the pro-senescence group showed a smaller skin fold thickness of the upper arm and their physiological function index changed significantly. Furthermore, with P < 0.05, the systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure among the cardiovascular and pulmonary function of the two groups decreased, and at the same time, the vital capacity increased,. Conclusion: Aerobic exercise can exert positive impact on the biological age, physiological function and body shape of the elderly males with different aging degree, and delay their senescence.","[Cai, Jianguang; Tang, Hui] Hunan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Sports, Xiangtan 411201, Peoples R China; [Yang, Aihua] Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Phys Educ, Changsha 410114, Hunan, Peoples R China","Cai, JG (corresponding author), Hunan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Sports, Xiangtan 411201, Peoples R China.",Pumancai@163.com,,,Natural Science Foundation of Hunan province [2015JJ2052],Natural Science Foundation of Hunan province.

To create a healthy generation and for health promotion, obesity must be more emphasised among healthcare providers and policy makers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency, awareness and self-management of obesity among healthcare providers. This study also evaluated whether sociodemographic factors influence obesity and obesity awareness and management among the participants. Material and methods: The study was cross-sectional; the research was conducted with 493 healthcare providers. The study group ranged in age from 18-57 years. The survey questions were prepared using the World Health Organisation (WHO) STEP wise approach to noncommunicable disease risk factor surveillance. Results: The frequency of obesity among healthcare providers was 14.9%. Obesity risks were 3.361 fold (95% CI, 1.996-5.727) higher in older age groups than younger. There was no significant relationship identified between obesity and gender. A relatively low educational level meant a 2.688-fold (95% CI, 1.590-4.546) increase in the risk of obesity. The obesity rate was significantly higher in married participants and significantly lower in childless participants. The frequency of obesity by occupation was 16% for doctors, 1% for nurses, 13% for permanent medical staff, and 22% for medical information technology staff. A higher rate of eating a regular balanced diet was observed in doctors. It was observed that cigarette smoking increased the risk of obesity 1.852-fold (95% CI, 1.282.2.973). Conclusion: Although obesity awareness was low among all healthcare providers, the frequency of obesity was lower than the general population in this study group.","[Cakmur, Hulya] Kafkas Univ, Sch Med, Dept Family Med, Kars, Turkey; [Anuk, Turgut] Kafkas Univ, Dept Gen Surg, Sch Med, Kars, Turkey","Cakmur, H (corresponding author), Kafkas Univ, Sch Med, Dept Family Med, Kars, Turkey.",,,,,,,26,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,1073.0,1079,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_170,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500029,,,,,2022-07-14

Conclusion: The methanolic seed extract from Lawsonia inermis presented a very good antioxidant activity, a stronger 5-lipoxygenase and moderate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities. The strongest activity of Henna seed against human breast cancer cells (HTC-116) were obtained for the chloroform extract (IC50 = 45 mg/L). Our findings suggested that Lawsonia inermis seed could be a potential source of active molecule.","[Chaibi, Rafika; Drine, Sawsen; Ferchichi, Ali] Inst Arid Reg, Lab Arid Land & Oases Cropping, Medenine, Tunisia","Chaibi, R (corresponding author), Inst Arid Reg, Lab Arid Land & Oases Cropping, Medenine, Tunisia.",chercheur_rafika@yahoo.com,,,Research Deputy of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences [92423],"Hereby, the authors would like to express their gratitude to the Research Center for Environmental Determinants of Health, School of Public Health, for reviewing the project and also to the Research Deputy of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences for approving and funding the research (No. 92423).",,26,1,2,1,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,981.0,986,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_155,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500014,,,,,2022-07-14

Indeed, many studies have suggested that among powerful pre-carcinogens involved in breast carcinogenesis derived from aromatic and heterocyclic amines. These are either directly detoxified or converted into carcinogens by N-acetyltransferases-1 and 2. Both highly polymorphic isoenzymes are involved in the increased susceptibility to breast cancer. The objective of our work was to examine the effects of N-acetyltransferase 1*15 (NAT1*15) polymorphism and its relationship with red meat consumption and cigarettes smoking, on breast cancer risk. Materiel and methods: The C and T alleles were identified by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis for 60 Algerian patients with BC and 60 women controls. Results: There was no association between NAT1*15 polymorphisms and Breast cancer. However, the red meat intake increased susceptibility to the disease (p=0.017, OR=5.537). Conclusion: Our results suggest that NAT1* 15 polymorphisms would not be involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. However, the red meat intake would be a risk factor for breast cancer in our population. This risk can be attributed to the high fat contained in the red meat.","[Chelouti, Hiba; Khelil, Malika] Univ Sci & Technol Houari Boumed, Fac Sci Biol, Dept Biol Cellulaire & Mol, BP 32 El Alia, Algiers 16111, Algeria; [Bouzid, Kamel] CHU Mustapha Bacha, Ctr Pierre & Marie Curie, Serv Oncol, Algiers, Algeria","Khelil, M (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol Houari Boumed, Fac Sci Biol, Dept Biol Cellulaire & Mol, BP 32 El Alia, Algiers 16111, Algeria.",,,,,,,29,1,1,1,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,1.0,,,,,89.0,93,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1_014,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2PY,WOS:000397226800014,,,,,2022-07-14

However, these are unconscious memories, which are not easily retrievable and expressible. The purpose of this study was to verify whether and how pregnancy and birth patterns affect the lifestyle of an adult subject. 50 volunteer students of the Degree Course in Psychological Sciences and Techniques of the University of Catania took part in the research. The sample was subjected to the regression technique, and then a nine-question questionnaire was given out to be filled in anonymously. Only 15 out of 50 subjects returned it completed. The results obtained have shown how the experience of rebirth influences the quality of present life. One observes how the experience of regression is significantly correlated with the perception of one's self and how subjects can retrieve memories of unconscious feelings that experience has led them to live, which may partly account for one's personality.","[Coco, Marinella; Buscemi, Barbara; Buscemi, Andrea] Horus Cooperat Social, Ragusa, Italy; [Ramaci, Tiziana] Univ Kore, Enna, Italy; [Sagone, Elisabetta; Perciavalle, Valentina] Univ Catania, Dept Educ Sci, Catania, Italy; [Sardo, Milena Galati; Brachina, Paola; Coco, Lucio Salvatore Giovanni; Papotto, Giacomo; Papotto, Giulio Maria Federico; Di Gregorio, Giulia] Univ Catania, Catania, Italy; [Petralia, Maria Cristina] Univ Catania, Dept Biomed & Biotechnol Sci, Catania, Italy","Coco, M (corresponding author), Horus Cooperat Social, Ragusa, Italy.",marinella.coco@gmail.com,"Coco, Marinella/AAC-8750-2020; papotto, giacomo/AAP-3068-2021; RAMACI, TIZIANA/AAD-3672-2019; Sagone, Elisabetta/AAC-1483-2022; Petralia, Maria/AAE-6337-2019","papotto, giacomo/0000-0001-8103-8075; RAMACI, TIZIANA/0000-0002-0745-2013; Petralia, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-9643-1045; SAGONE, Elisabetta/0000-0001-5283-4603",,,,23,4,4,0,8,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,901.0,904,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_143,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500002,,,,,2022-07-14

There are several methods that help to decrease the high- flow rate. This study aims to investigate the effects of circular narrowing technique on lowering the flow rate with a polytetrafluoroethylene graft for the treatment of patients with a high- flow arteriovenous fistula and to present our shortand mid- term results. Materials and methods: Seven patients with a fistula flow rate of above 1200 ml/min were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were operated on under local anesthesia and underwent a circular narrowing procedure with a polytetrafluoroethylene graft. Additional aneurysmectomy was performed on the patients with aneurysms. Fistula flow rates were recorded at baseline and following the procedure. Results: Postoperative thrill was observed in all patients. The mean preoperative flow rate of arteriovenous fistula was 1428 +/- 230 ml/min. At three to six months following the procedure, it was 655 +/- 98 ml/min. Two patients suffered from pain in the arm at rest preoperatively and the pain resolved postoperatively. All patients continued to receive hemodialysis through the native fistula on a regular basis in the postoperative period.

The patients without aeration of the frontal bone and ethmoidal cells above the supraorbital margin (horizontal line) and patients without aerated cells extending beyond the medial wall of the orbit (vertical line) were considered to have frontal sinus aplasia Results: Of 1502 patients with an age range between 16 and 73 years, 819 were females and 683 were males. Of these patients, 42 (0.27%) had bilateral frontal sinus aplasia and 53 (0.35%) had unilateral frontal sinus aplasia. Only two patients had sphenoid sinus aplasia and one patient had maxillary sinus aplasia. Conclusion: Paranasal sinuses represent great structural variations. Fractures, mucocele, primary ciliary dyskinesia, infections, and some syndromes may affect the development of PNSs. Aplasia of PNSs can point to clinically significant diseases and it must be kept in mind and explored during planning for surgical intervention to the sinuses in order to prevent complications.

Presence of the ermA, ermC, mecA, tetK, tetM, gyrA, parC, aacA, and vanA genes and PVL (lukF/lukS) was investigated using the hybridization method following a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: In this study, 63.5% of the 96 strains were identified as methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and 36.5% as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In 15.6% of the S. aureus strains, only ermA was detected; in 10.4%, only ermC; in 2.1%, both ermA and ermC; in 36.5%, only mecA; in 11.5%, only tetK; in 18.8%, only tetM; in 1.0%, both tetK and M; in 1.0%, only the gyrA mutation; in 7.3%, only the parC mutation; in 14.6%, both gyrA and parC mutations; in 31.3%, aacA; in 5.2%, the PVL gene. The VanA gene was not detected in any strain. Conclusion: According to our analysis, there may be S. aureus strains that carry but do not express known resistance genes, so other genes that may be responsible for resistance should be researched.","[Eksi, Fahriye] Gaziantep Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Univ Bulvari, TR-27310 Gaziantep, Turkey","Eksi, F (corresponding author), Gaziantep Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Univ Bulvari, TR-27310 Gaziantep, Turkey.",,,,Gaziantep University Scientific Research Projects Administration Department Commission Directorate [TF.13.13],"This study, Project No. TF.13.13, was supported by the Gaziantep University Scientific Research Projects Administration Department Commission Directorate.",,39,5,5,1,8,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,2.0,,,,,341.0,349,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_2_051,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2RK,WOS:000397230700026,,,,,2022-07-14

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between schizoaffective disorder and serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-alpha, hs-CRP, including the comparison between the affective episodes of the disease. Materials and methods: The study group consisted of 40 patients with bipolar type schizoaffective disorder as defined by DSM-IV criteria and 39 healthy control subjects. IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-alpha and hsCRP serum levels were examined by ELISA. Their clinical symptoms were rated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale. Univariate analysis of covariance controlled for possible confounders was used to compare cytokines and hsCRP levels among the groups. Results: hsCRP levels were significantly higher in patients compared to controls and IL-4 levels were significantly lower in patients compared to controls. hsCRP levels were significantly higher during the depressive phase, and IL-4 levels were significantly lower during the manic phase in patients compared to controls. No statistically significant differences were found in IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha. Conclusion: The results suggest that inflammatory dysregulation is associated with the schizoaffective disorder, and these changes may be related to affective phases of the bipolar type schizoaffective disorder.","[Elboga, Gulcin; Altindag, Abdurrahman] Gaziantep Univ, Med Fac, Dept Psychiat, Sahinbey, Gaziantep, Turkey; [Sahin, Sengul Kocamer] Adana State Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Adana, Turkey; [Sahin, Ahmet Ziya] Adana Askim Tufekei State Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Adana, Turkey","Elboga, G (corresponding author), Gaziantep Univ, Med Fac, Dept Psychiat, Sahinbey, Gaziantep, Turkey.",,"Sahin, Ahmet Ziyaettin/AAI-1994-2021; Elboga, Gulcin/AAG-6587-2020; Şahin, Ahmet Ziyaettin/A-8069-2012; Şahin, Şengül/AAI-2398-2019; Altindag, Abdurrahman/AAG-6463-2020","Sahin, Ahmet Ziyaettin/0000-0003-1060-6746; Şahin, Ahmet Ziyaettin/0000-0003-1060-6746; Şahin, Şengül/0000-0002-5371-3907; Altindag, Abdurrahman/0000-0001-5531-4419",Gaziantep University Scientific Research Project Department [TF.12.32],Gaziantep University Scientific Research Project Department supports this study.

Materials and methods: The present study was conducted on 60 patients. Patients were divided into two groups of 30, based on random table of Excel. The target group received 0.25 mg per day subcutaneous Cetrorelix on days 1, 2 and 3, which was injected on the fourth day of menstruation and for the control group, fixed Cetrorelix, was started on the 6th day of cycle and continued until HCG injection. Both groups received 300 IU gonadotropin for four days that was adjusted based on the ultrasound results. Then gonadotropin consumption, number of oocytes and pregnancy rates were clinically compared. Results: In the present study, there was no difference between the case and control group regarding pregnancy rate (P value = 0.54). Cetrorelix dose used and the total number of days of treatment were significantly different between the two groups (P value = 0.0001) and the target group used higher dose of Cetrorelix but had a lower duration of therapy. The two groups were not significantly different in the primary outcome, including chemical and clinical pregnancy (P value = 0.58) (P value = 0.68). Conclusion: It was demonstrated in the present study that short-term and fixed use of GnRH antagonist in the follicular phase was not different and the short-term protocol decreases the length of treatment and increases the costs.","[Elham, Rahmani] Bushehr Univ Med Sci, Dept Gynecol Obstet, Bushehr, Iran; [Shahnaz, Ahmadi; Afsaneh, Ghasemi] Iran Univ Med Sci, Dept Gynecol Obstet, Tehran, Iran; [Niloofar, Motamed] Bushehr Univ Med Sci, Community, Bushehr, Iran; [Zohreh, Zamani] Bushehr Univ Med Sci, Bushehr, Iran","Shahnaz, A (corresponding author), Iran Univ Med Sci, Dept Gynecol Obstet, Tehran, Iran.",Ahmadishahnaz2005@yahoo.com,"Rahmani, Elham/S-4222-2017; Motamed, Niloofar/F-3355-2017","Motamed, Niloofar/0000-0001-5291-1680; Rahmani, Elham/0000-0001-8392-7685; ahmadi, shahnaz/0000-0002-2136-4474",,,,15,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,5.0,,,,,785.0,788,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_5_115,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FA9PC,WOS:000405777000009,,,,,2022-07-14

However, EFT thickness in patients with hyperparathyroidism who were treated with parathyroidectomy has not yet been studied. In this study we aimed to examine whether carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and EFT thickness would be affected after treatment of PHPT by parathyroidectomy. Materials and methods: 27 patients with PHPT who were diagnosed with a parathyroidectomy indication and 39 healthy volunteers were included in the study. For all patients with PHPT, anthropometric measurements were made before and 12 months after parathyroidectomy, and EFT thickness, CIMT, serum parathormone (PTH), calcium and lipid levels were measured. Results: It was observed that preoperative CIMT and EFT thickness in patients with PHPT were significantly higher than the control group (for both p<0.001). Although hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia of the patients improved after parathyroidectomy, no significant change in the thickness of CIMT or EFT was determined. Conclusions: CIMT and EFT thickness seem to be good cardiovascular indicators for diagnosis of patients with PHPT. Nevertheless, this study raises the question of the reliability of a decrease in these parameters in patient follow-up. It is therefore necessary to be more careful in evaluating these parameters after treatment of patients with PHPT.","[Eroglu, Mustafa; Asik, Mehmet] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Med, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, Canakkale, Turkey; [Eroglu, Mustafa; Asik, Mehmet] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, Canakkale, Turkey; [Erbag, Gokhan] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Med, Canakkale, Turkey; [Temiz, Ahmet; Altun, Burak] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Med, Dept Cardiol, Canakale, Turkey","Eroglu, M (corresponding author), Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Med, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, Canakkale, Turkey.",,"şen, hacer/AAC-2469-2021; Eroğlu, Mustafa/AAC-1081-2020","Eroğlu, Mustafa/0000-0002-7526-7151; Asik, mehmet/0000-0002-0716-0221",,,,30,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,1.0,,,,,77.0,81,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1_012,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2PY,WOS:000397226800012,,,,,2022-07-14

The patients who restrict dietary sodium intake have better cardiovascular outcomes and quality of life. The purpose of this study was to assess dietary knowledge of patients about dietary sodium and medical complications of noncompliance. Materials and methods: An interviewer-administered questionnaire about knowledge of dietary sodium, and medical complications of dietary noncompliance was applied to hemodialysis patients. Results: Although 85.3% of patients reported that high sodium intake was associated with high blood pressure, interdialytic weight gain were more than 5.7% in 81.6% of patients. There was no statistically significant difference between genders, educational, and economic status of patients and interdialytic weight gain. Overall knowledge scores were poor, moderate, and high in 16%, 56%, and 28% of patients, respectively. The awareness score of risks of noncompliance was high in only 24% of patients. The knowledge scores showed significant weak positive correlation with educational level (spearman's rho (rs)=0.17, p=0.03). There was no correlation with knowledge levels and interdialytic weight gains (rs=-0.13, p=0.11). The awareness did not differ with educational level, and age (rs=-0.01, p=0.84, and rs=0.13, p=0.10, respectively). Conclusion: Majority of the patients have not still perceived the constituents of salt-free diet despite the implementation of the governmental salt reduction program. More impressive dietetic and psycho-educational techniques to promote dietary changes and compliance should be implemented.","[Ersan, Sibel; Liv, Fatma; Tanrisev, Mehmet; Colak, Hulya; Yilmaz, Banu; Alp, Alper] Izmir Tepecik Res & Training Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Izmir, Turkey","Ersan, S (corresponding author), Izmir Tepecik Res & Training Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Izmir, Turkey.",,"ERSAN, SİBEL/ABF-1542-2021; Alp, Alper/AAK-2766-2020; Colak, Hulya/AAB-1979-2021","ERSAN, SİBEL/0000-0002-9381-5262; Alp, Alper/0000-0002-2864-361X; ",,,,17,2,2,1,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,2.0,,,,,217.0,222,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_2_032,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2RK,WOS:000397230700007,,,,,2022-07-14

After excluding viral hepatitis, diagnosis leaned towards hepatitis secondary to paracetamol, which was later confirmed by serum paracetamol levels (69.4 mg/L). Despite acetylcysteine therapy, the patient died after a few hours. Upon macroscopic examination at autopsy, diffuse congestion of the hepatic parenchyma with alterations to the normal structure and diffuse parenchymal necrosis were observed. Upon microscopic examination of hepatic tissue, features of hepatic centrilobular necrosis were present. From data reported in the literature, findings obtained from the clinical history and the anatomopathological evidence suggested that the death of the patient was attributable to accidental paracetamol poisoning.","[Feola, Alessandro] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Biomed & Prevent, Via Montpellier 1, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Della Pietra, Bruno] Univ Naples 2, Dept Expt Med, Via Luciano Armanni 5, I-80138 Naples, Italy","Feola, A (corresponding author), Via Montpellier 1, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",alessandro.feola@icloud.com,"Feola, Alessandro/AAI-4601-2020","Feola, Alessandro/0000-0002-9666-2636; Della Pietra, Bruno/0000-0002-1832-5618",,,,14,4,4,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,1.0,,,,,55.0,58,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1_008,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2PY,WOS:000397226800008,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were sensitized and randomly allocated into two groups: control (n = 10) and PTK (n = 10). One hr prior to intra-nasal challenge with the antigen, rats received either the PTK or saline vehicle per os. Nasal symptoms and quality of life were compared between the rats in the two groups over the course of 20 min post-challenge. Nasal fluids and in serum were collected 1 hr after the antigen challenge and then evaluated for the levels of several key inflammatory mediators. Lipid mediator production was also evaluated ex vivo using PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and granulocytes from the sensitized rats. Results: The results showed that a single administration of PTK extract resulted in significantly decreased histamine and LTs levels (LTB4 and cysteinyl-LTs) in the blood and nasal fluids of the rats. Further, the synthesis of cysteinyl-LTs and LTB4 were all significantly inhibited ex vivo by the PTK extract. Overall, the treatment with PTK extract significantly alleviated the nasal symptoms and improved the quality-of-life of the challenged hosts. Conclusion: Taken together, these results indicated to us that PTK extract was effective in treating AR, in part, by decreasing levels of nasal inflammatory mediators and the synthesis of LTs and, in doing so, ameliorated allergy symptoms and improved the quality of life of the antigen-challenged sensitized hosts.","[Fu, Yugui] Linyi Peoples Hosp, Dept Otolaryngol, Linyi 276003, Peoples R China; [Hu, Dejian] Weifang Peoples Hosp, Dept Pharm, Weifang 261000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Li] Qingdao Univ, Dept Otolaryngol, Affiliated Yantai Yuhuangding Hosp, Yantai 264000, Peoples R China","Wang, L (corresponding author), Qingdao Univ, Dept Otolaryngol, Affiliated Yantai Yuhuangding Hosp, Yantai 264000, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,35,1,1,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,1129.0,1135,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_177,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500036,,,,,2022-07-14

In this work, the role of single point mutations of reverse transcriptase on drug resistance has been studied based in silico methods. Through this study, the most important single point mutations of transcriptase enzyme have been simulated. Consequently, cross-docking simulations were used to compare binding energies of native and mutated enzymes with some known inhibitors. The purpose of the study was to find some structural features which are responsible for drug resistance against this target. Presence of phosphate groups showed to increase the chance of drug resistance while hydrazinecarboxamide substructure was beneficial to decrease less drug resistance.","[Ghorbani, Mahdieh; Sakhteman, Amirhossein; Rezaei, Zahra] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Sch Pharm, Dept Med Chem, Shiraz, Iran; [Gohari, Ali] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, Shiraz, Iran","Sakhteman, A (corresponding author), Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Sch Pharm, Dept Med Chem, Shiraz, Iran.",,"Sakhteman, Amirhossein/L-6685-2016; sakhteman, amirhossein/T-4285-2017","Sakhteman, Amirhossein/0000-0002-1922-6523; sakhteman, amirhossein/0000-0002-1922-6523",Shiraz university of medical sciences [8714],This work was financially supported by Shiraz university of medical sciences (grant number: 8714),,28,0,1,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,5.0,,,,,745.0,749,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_5_109,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FA9PC,WOS:000405777000003,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: In total, 51 patients with AIS and 49 sex-and-age matched healthy participant as controls were enrolled the study. With the new automated extent practice developed by Erel, Serum TOS, TAS and OSI was measured. In addition serum erythrocytes level were measured. Results: Subjects suffering AIS had higher TOS and OSI level than those control subjects. In contrast the TAS level were moderate higher in the controls than patients. In addition serum Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and Red cell distribution width (RDW) levels were higher in patients with AIS in accordance with the controls. Conclusions: Patients with AIS are subjected to oxidative stress and thus, erythrocyte indices have a significant impact on this type of patients.

Information about the disease is mostly based on retrospective studies and its prognosis is not clearly defined. We investigated the electro-clinical course and prognostic features of the disease in this prospective study in which clinical follow-up and treatment were standardized as much as possible. Materials and methods: In the study, patients (10 females, 9 males) were followed-up for an average of 9.47 +/- 5.47 years (range: 2-17). The seizures were ceased in 16 (84.2%) patients, and remission was achieved in 12 (63.2%). The seizures continued in 3 patients (15.8%) despite mono-or poly-therapy. When we compared the cases with (12 patients) or without remission (7 patients), the age at disease onset was lower in cases without remission (7 +/- 5.44 years) compared to those with remission (12.08 +/- 2.71 years), (p=0.014). Likewise, the total number of seizures experienced before remission was higher in cases without remission (27 +/- 41.04) (median: 12 range: 10-120) compared to those with (6.25 +/- 7.84) (median: 4 range: 2-30) (p=0.003). Results: In patients with abnormal EEG at baseline, EEG recordings were normalized in those with remission (100%) but remained to be abnormal in those couldn't achieve remission. Of 5 cases with normal EEG recording from onset to end of follow-up period, remission was achieved in 4 cases but not in one case. Conclusion: Our result indicated that consistently normal EEG recordings or abnormal EEG recordings that normalized during follow-up strongly suggest good prognosis. In addition, we concluded that smaller number of seizures experienced before remission and a relative older age, given the age of onset of the disease, can be indicators of good prognosis.","[Gonen, Murat; Aytac, Emrah; Mungen, Bulent] Firat Univ, Neurol Clin, Fac Med, Elazig, Turkey","Aytac, E (corresponding author), Firat Univ, Neurol Clin, Fac Med, Elazig, Turkey.",,"AYTAC, EMRAH/X-1420-2018; GÖNEN, Murat/AAA-1811-2021",,,,,7,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,,,,2.0,,1175.0,1179,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_2s_183,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV8ZY,WOS:000424877700001,,,,,2022-07-14

Data on age, anthropometrics, blood biochemistry, HOMA-IR, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) were recorded in each subject as were plasma resistin (mu g/L) and visfatin (mu g/ml) levels, epicardial, subcutaneous and abdominal fat thickness (mm). Correlates of visceral and subcutaneous fat thickness were determined via linear regression models with inclusion of severity of obesity, insulin resistance, plasma resistin and visfatin levels and CIMT as variables. Results: Epicardial fat thickness (mm) was 3.1(1.0-10.20) and 8.8(2.60-13.0), CIMT (mm) was 5.8(4.7-8.9) and 5.9(4-8.6), abdominal fat thickness (mm) was 10.8(7.8-16.1) and 13.2(8.7-16.5), subcutaneous fat thickness(mm) was 43.8(28.4-62.9) and 57.4(39.5-72.7), plasma resistin levels (mu g/L) were 8.5(4.7-38.1) and 10.8(0.7-26.4) and plasma visfatin levels (mu g/ml) were 55.5(5.1-209.5) and 78.2(4.7-228) in obese and morbidly obese patients, respectively. Linear regression analysis revealed that being morbidly obese was likely to increase epicardial fat thickness by 4.33mm(p=0.004) compared with obesity, while for each 1 unit increase in HOMA levels, subcutaneous fat thickness was likely to decrease by 1.16mm(p=0.009). Conclusion: In conclusion, our findings revealed that neither plasma levels for resistin and visfatin nor CIMT correlated with visceral or subcutaneous fat thickness in non-diabetic obese females, while increase in subcutaneous and epicardial fat thickness values were noted with decrease in HOMA-IR and the presence of morbid obesity, respectively.","[Gul, Ozen Oz; Cander, Soner; Ersoy, Canan] Uludag Univ, Med Sch, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, TR-16059 Gorukle, Bursa, Turkey; [Pekgoz, Murat] Uludag Univ, Med Sch, Dept Internal Med, Bursa, Turkey; [Gullulu, Sumeyye; Tutuncu, Ahmet; Sag, Saim] Uludag Univ, Med Sch, Dept Cardiol, Bursa, Turkey; [Seker, Ismail] Bilson Radiol Ctr, Bursa, Turkey; [Acikgoz, Ebru; Sarandol, Emre] Uludag Univ, Med Sch, Biochem, Bursa, Turkey","Gul, OO (corresponding author), Uludag Univ, Med Sch, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, TR-16059 Gorukle, Bursa, Turkey.",,"Ersoy, Canan/AAH-8861-2021; Gul, Ozen Oz/AAI-1005-2021; SARANDÖL, EMRE/ABE-1716-2020; sag, saim/AAW-9185-2020","SARANDÖL, EMRE/0000-0002-2593-7196; sag, saim/0000-0001-8404-8252",,,,34,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,1017.0,1023,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_161,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500020,,,,,2022-07-14

Recently, many clinical trials and experimental studies were conducted about the effects of HBO on AN. Aim: Current treatment modalities partially address a need for adequate remedy to this disease. Prosthetic surgery performed on patients due to AN may cause some medical problems in long term follow up. HBO treatment can bring a new modality option for AN. There is no much data on the efficacy of HBO therapy on disease healing and delay of implementation of prosthetic implants. The aim of this review was to evaluate and summarize the evidence for application of HBO as a treatment for AN. Methods: The study included 10 randomized studies found in databases including PubMed/MedLine, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Databases. The keywords hyperbaric* oxygen therapy or hyperbaric* oxygen treatment and avascular necrosis or aseptic necrosis or femoral head necrosis were used, and no time frame was selected. Results: The studies covered in our work consisted of experimental, clinical, and case series assessments. Three were controlled, experimental studies, and seven were clinical trials, which are generally considered more valuable due to their power and study design. Studies were evaluated in three category title; primary outcomes, stage of disease and effectiveness. HBO therapy has been shown to be effective in all three categories. Conclusion: The incidence of patients with AN is increasing majorly due to some external factors, steroid and trauma. Although the existed literature is qualified, the number of articles about the effects of HBO on AN are still quite few in the electronic database. In order to evidently state the efficacy of HBO in AN, well designed, comprehensive, randomized studies are required.","[Gunes, Ali Erdal] Harran Univ, Sch Med, Underwater & Hyperbar Med Dept, Sanliurfa, Turkey; [Aktas, Samil] Istanbul Univ, Istanbul Sch Med, Underwater & Hyperbar Med Dept, Istanbul, Turkey","Gunes, AE (corresponding author), Harran Univ, Sch Med, Dept Underwater & Hyperbar Med, Yenisehir Campus, TR-63300 Sanliurfa, Turkey.",,"Aktaş, Şamil/AAD-6656-2020; GUNES, ALI ERDAL/ABF-3292-2020",,,,,27,0,0,1,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,1.0,,,,,29.0,34,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1_004,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2PY,WOS:000397226800004,,,,,2022-07-14

Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is one of those that 15% of diabetic patients experience with DFU during their lifetime. Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a marker of platelet activation and function. It means that increase of MPV release of highly reactive platelets from stores and related with thrombotic disease and atherosclerosis. The aim of this study is corresponding elevated MPV on lead to the ulcers. Methods: We included consecutive 28 patients with Type 2 diabetes and non-gangrenous DFU and matched 28 patients with Type 2 diabetes and without foot ulcers as well as 28 healthy volunteers for age and sex. Diagnostic criteria for diabetic foot ulcers were the presence of systemic signs of infection, purulent wound secretion or at least two local findings of inflammation (e.g., redness, warmth, induration, pain or tenderness). Results: Hemoglobin level of DFU group was lower than healthy control group (p=0.001). MPV levels were higher in DFU group when compared to diabetic or healthy control groups (p=0.03 and p<0.001, respectively). MPV was higher in diabetic group with DFU when compared to both diabetic and healthy control groups. Discussion: The atherosclerotic process and disorders of vascular circulation in the course of DFU may explain the high MPV in patients with DFU. Conclusions: All of these underlying pathogenic disorders may influence the volume of platelets or high MPV -as a marker of more thrombogenic and active platelets- may contribute the development of DFU.","[Gunes, Ali Erdal] Harran Univ, Sch Med, Underwater & Hyperbar Med Dept, Osmanbey Campus, TR-63300 Sanliurfa, Turkey; [Eren, Mehmet Ali; Aslan, Huseyin Kara; Sabuncu, Tevfik] Harran Univ, Sch Med, Endocrinol Dept, Sanliurfa, Turkey; [Karakas, Emel Yigit; Demir, Mehmet] Harran Univ, Sch Med, Internal Med Dept, Sanliurfa, Turkey","Gunes, AE (corresponding author), Harran Univ, Sch Med, Underwater & Hyperbar Med Dept, Osmanbey Campus, TR-63300 Sanliurfa, Turkey.",,"GUNES, ALI ERDAL/ABF-3292-2020; Sabuncu, Tevfik/ABF-5291-2020; eren, mehmet ali/ABH-7279-2020","Sabuncu, Tevfik/0000-0001-6504-5355; ",,,,18,5,5,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,3.0,,,,,401.0,404,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_3_058,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EV3BF,WOS:000401631200006,,,,,2022-07-14

The occurrence of lumbar spondylolysis will affect athletes' competitive level, physical and mental health, which requires attention in daily care and treatment. Methods: In this paper, badminton players' lumbar spondylolysis was analyzed based on biomechanical research method. Besides, three-dimensional activity range of upper spine in biological model and lumbar spondylolysis upper spinal stability was studied and discussed, with the aim to provide a practical reference for trauma therapy of badminton players' lumbar spondylolysis. In this study, 3000 cases of adults' fresh lumbar specimens were selected and the cut off L5 bilateral spondylolysis formed as the test model. The specimen was applied with flexion, extension, lateral bending and rotation of 10 Nm torque before (normal) and after modeling (lumbar spondylolysis group) via three-dimensional movement experimental mechanism of the spine. Results: From the results obtained, the flexion, extension and rotation for upper spine (L4) spondylolysis group specimens was 12.70 degrees, 4.80 degrees and 3.71 degrees respectively while the average values for normal group model were 10.40 degrees, 3.70 degrees and 2.78 degrees respectively. Comparison of both the test data demonstrated significant statistical difference. The results were higher in lumbar spondylolysis group with the value of 22.1%, 29.4% and 33.8% respectively. However there is no significant difference between the average value of flexion activities for spondylolysis group (7.74 degrees) and normal group (7.67 degrees) Spondylolysis spine (1.5) motion range of flexion, extension and rotation gave values of 12.69 degrees, 6.29 degrees, 4.10 degrees, while average value of normal group was 10.12 degrees, 5.19 degrees, 3.01 degrees respectively, with significant differences between the groups, reflecting P value less than 0.01. Spondylolysis group values increased by 25.4%, 44.1% and 36.4% while range of flexion activities for spondylolysis group was 6.12 degrees and 6.06 degrees for normal group. The difference between the groups was not obvious therefore it's not statistically significant. Conclusions: From the above studies, specific conclusion is that lumbar spondylolysis will adversely affect the badminton players' upper spine stability. It should also take be noted that, some of the badminton players might suffer from instability of upper spine in flexion, extension and rotation, which has a negative impact on athletes' competitive level and career.","[Guo, Taiwei; Wang, Lei] Yangzhou Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Guo, TW (corresponding author), Yangzhou Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",licewhet@163.com,,,,,,12,0,0,1,17,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,,,,3.0,,1325.0,1328,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_3s_206,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AC,WOS:000424878100008,,,,,2022-07-14

Although Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has been widely used as a marker for predicting the severity of DM, there are controversial reports in the literature regarding its association with the severity of CAD. The aim of our study was to determine the association between HbA1c levels and severity of CAD in both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetic patients with admission hyperglycemia. Materials and methods: The files of the patients who were admitted to the emergency department of a regional training and research hospital from 2014 to 2015 due to acute coronary syndrome and whose diagnosis was confirmed by coronary angiography and HbA1c levels were analyzed were reviewed retrospectively. Those patients whose HbA1c levels were measured were divided into two groups: diagnosed diabetes (DD) or undiagnosed diabetes (UDD). Gensini score was measured for all patients and the correlation between elevated HbA1c levels and severity of coronary artery disease was subjected to statistical analysis. Results: Out of 168 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 85.1% (n=143) were male, while 14.9% (n=25) were female. The mean age was 46.6 +/- 6.5 years. HbA1c was found to have a significantly positive correlation with the Gensini score in DD group (n=77), whereas no significant correlation was found between HbA1c and the Gensini score in UDD group (n=91) (p <0.001; correlation coefficient: 0.656, p=0.207; correlation coefficient: 0.251, respectively). Linear regression analysis revealed that HbA1c was a significant predictor for gensini score (p<0.001; a: 0.632). Conclusion: HbA1c can be used as a predictor for the evaluation of diabetic patients with CAD. Moreover, HbA1c was not found to have a significant association with the severity of CAD in undiagnosed diabetic CAD patients with admission hyperglycemia.","[Guven, Ramazan] Bitlis State Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Bitlis, Turkey; [Aykal, Guzin] Antalya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Biochem, Antalya, Turkey; [Gungor, Faruk; Akyol, K.

An interdisciplinary pain management team includes healthcare providers from different disciplines, each of them specialized in various characteristics of pain, and all should be coordinated so that the optimum results will be achieved. Information technology has been used in various domains of medicine. The aim of this study was to review relevant articles and find out power and weak points in pain management developed information systems and technologies used in these systems in the spinal cord injury population. Research method: A literature review was established to search developed information systems for pain management of patient with spinal cord injury, e-journals collections, and printed journals, books, dissertations, and theses for relevant articles. The search strategy interchangeably used the terms of spinal cord injury, pain management system, expert system and clinical decision support system combined with Boolean operator AND. Search results (n=184) were adjusted for duplications, screened based on their abstract relevancy and full-text availability (n=93) and then assessed for eligibility (n=47). Eligible articles were included if they had explicitly focused on information systems for pain management, finally, 18 relevant articles included in the study. Results: Reviewing 18 articles published in English from 2007 to 2016 showed that computerized CDS systems may minimize pain mismanagements by nearly 60%, decrease hospital stay, and optimize co-morbidities' management. The results of the system showed an accuracy of about 78% for the diagnosis of the type of pain in patients with SCI. Different studies indicated positive role of the systems to increase accuracy and improve physician's decision making. Discussion: Use of Information Systems in medicine aid medical practitioners for better management. To produce such a device, it is necessary to choose methods and algorithms for classification, such as neural network, support vector machine, genetic algorithms, rule-based systems, decision tree, and so forth. Conclusion: Medical informatics like Developed Information Systems should become a powerful member of the team. Although Research on Developed Information Systems in chronic pain management is limited. Using medical informatics in medicine would result in 1-minimizing clinical errors (pharmaceutical and diagnostics), 2-optimizing care effectiveness, 3-saving the time, and 4-jump to novel ideas and knowledge in the field of medicine.","[Heidarabadi, Nasrolah Nasr; Safdari, Reza; Saeidi, Marjan Ghazi] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Allied Med Sci, Hlth Informat Management Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Heidarabadi, Nasrolah Nasr; Kolivand, Pirhossein; Hakemi, Laleh] Khatam Ol Anbia Hosp, Shefa Neurosci Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Tahmasbian, Shahram] Univ Med Sci, ShahreKord Med Sci Coll, Shahrekord, Iran","Safdari, R; Saeidi, MG (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Allied Med Sci, Hlth Informat Management Dept, Tehran, Iran.",nasr.a128@gmail.com,"Safdari, Reza/AAK-7482-2021; ghazisaeedi, marjan/AAL-4111-2021","ghazisaeedi, marjan/0000-0002-2400-209X; Kolivand, PirHossein/0000-0002-0532-4130; Safdari, Reza/0000-0002-4982-337X",,,,52,3,3,0,11,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,2.0,,,,,237.0,243,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_2_035,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2RK,WOS:000397230700010,,,,,2022-07-14

Neuroepithelial transforming gene 1 (NET1) is a carcinogenic gene, overexpressed in several cancers. The tumor suppressor gene CD82, which encodes the protein KAI1, is down regulated in cancers. Lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI) is closely associated with metastasis. We investigated the expression levels of NET1, KAI1/CD82, LVI and their correlation with clinicopathological factors in ESCC. Methods: Immunohistochemistry and Western Blot were used to detect NET1, KAI1/CD82 expression levels in the para-carcinoma tissue and ESCC. LVI detected by D2-40 immunohistochemical staining. The relationships between the protein expression levels, positive LVI and clinicopathologic data were analyzed. Eighty-five patients, who had a primary resection of esophageal cancer, were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression, and univariate and multivariate survival analysis. Results: NET1 expression levels in cervical cancer were significantly higher than in the para-carcinoma tissue, (P<0.05). KAI1/CD82 expression was markedly lower in ESCC than in the para-carcinoma tissue (P<0.05). NET1 high expression and positive LVI were positively correlated while KAI1/CD82 expression was negatively correlated with invasion, lymph node metastasis, and clinical stage. They were all independent prognostic factors for lymph node metastasis. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that NET1 high expression and positive LVI was negatively correlated with overall survival (OS), while KAI1/CD82 expression was positively correlated with OS. Low KAI1/CD82 expression, high expression of NET1, positive LVI was associated with a poor prognosis in ESCC. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the positive LVI were independent predictors for OS in ESCC.

D2-40 labeled LVI and LVD are also closely associated with cancer metastasis. We investigated the expression levels of KAI1/CD82, D2-40 labeled LVI and LVD and their correlation with clinicopathological factors in ESCC. Methods: Immunohistochemistry and Western Blot were used to detect KAI1/CD82 expression levels in the peritumoral tissue and ESCC. LVI and LVD detected by D2-40 immunohistochemical staining. The relationships between the KAI1/CD82 expression levels, LVI and LVD were analyzed. The prognosis of ESCC was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox's proportional hazards model. Results: KAI1/CD82 expression was markedly lower in ESCC than in the para-carcinoma tissue (P< 0.05). Positive peritumoral LVI and high mean peritumoral LVD were positively correlated while KAI1/CD82 expression was negatively correlated with tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and clinical stage. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high mean peritumoral LVD and positive LVI was negatively correlated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) time, while KAI1/CD82 expression was positively correlated with OS and DFS time. Low KAI1/CD82 expression, high mean peritumoral LVD, positive LVI was associated with a poor prognosis in ESCC. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the positive LVI and KAI1/CD82 positive expression were independent predictors for OS in ESCC. Positive LVI and high mean peritumoral LVD were independent predictors for DFS in ESCC Conclusions: KAI1/CD82 expression, LVI and LVD were significantly correlated with some clinicopathological factors of ESCC including lymph node metastasis, differentiation, and clinical stage.

This classification of subtypes is important for the treatment and prognosis of the disease. The relationship between molecular subtypes of breast cancer and axillary involvement remains controversial. The purpose of this study is to examine whether there is a relationship between molecular subtypes and axillary involvement in breast cancer, and whether such relationshipis useful in the decision of surgical interventions for the axilla. Materials and methods: Medical records of 86 patients with breast cancer were examined retrospectively. Data were collected on the following independent variables: age, gender, menopausal status, neoadjuvant treatment, tumor size, axillary involvement, TNM stage, histologic type and grade, estrogen receptor(ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER-2 status, and the presence of p53 and Ki-67 gene expression. Patients in this cohort were grouped according to their molecular subtypes of the breast cancers as defined by the St. Gallen International Expert Consensus 2013. The relationship between molecular subtypes and nodal involvement was investigated and compared in terms of independent variables. In addition, Luminal A and Luminal B subtypes were compared with each other. Results: There were 20 (23.2%), 47(54.6%), 8(9.3%), and 4(4.6%) patients in the Luminal A, Luminal B, HER-2 (+), and Triple Negative(TN) groups, respectively. p53 gene expression was different in the TN group when compared with that in the Luminal A and B groups(p<0.05). There were no significant differences in any other independent variables among the molecular subtype groups. Overall, 40 (46.4%) patients had nodal involvement. Age, molecular subtypes of cancer, histologic grade, and hormone receptor status had no discernible effect on nodal involvement. Tumor stage correlated with nodal involvement(p<0.05). Conclusion: We were not able to find an association between nodal involvement and molecular subtypes of breast cancer in this study. Therefore, the prediction of axillary involvement based on the identification of molecular subtypes of breast cancer may not be possible, according to these results.","[Ilhan, Enver; Ureyen, Orhan; Alpdogan, Ozcan; Senlikci, Abdullah; Alay, Demet; Gokcelli, Ugur] Bozyaka Res & Training Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Izmir, Turkey; [Meral, Ulvi Mehmet] Izmir Mil Hosp, Gen Surg, Izmir, Turkey","Ureyen, O (corresponding author), Bozyaka Res & Training Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Izmir, Turkey.",,"Ureyen, Orhan/AGI-3233-2022; Senlikci, Abdullah/AAI-8432-2020","Ureyen, Orhan/0000-0002-7820-9088; ",,,,23,3,3,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,3.0,,,,,393.0,398,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_3_056,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EV3BF,WOS:000401631200004,,,,,2022-07-14

Controlled and/or unrecorded migrations which have been occurring as a result of Syrian war, leads to death of many people, increase poverty, make dissemination of diseases easier and increase health problems. Materials and methods: Data of Syrian refugee patients who were being surgical treatment and follow-up in Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Training and Research Hospital Department of Surgery (General Surgery, urology, gynecologic oncology, orthopedics and intensive care units) and for whom ELISA (HBsAg, Anti-HBs, Anti-HCV and anti-HIV) was performed between January and December 2015 were retrospectively evaluated from computerized records. Results: Three hundred Syrian refugee patients who were included in the study were evaluated. One hundred fifty six (52%) patients were female and 144 (48%) were male. The most common age distribution range was found between 16-30. One hundred twenty five (41.6%) patients in general surgery, 78 (26%) patients in orthopedics, 55 (18.4%) patients in urology and 42 (14%) patients in gynecological oncology underwent surgery. HBsAg positivity was found in 9 (3%), anti-HCV was found positivity in 7 (2.3%) and anti-HBs positivity was found in 73 (26.6%) patients. Anti-HIV positivity was found in none of these patients. Conclusion: Increasing number of uncontrolled and unrecorded Syrian refugees causes lots of social and health problems. We recommended that is important to know frequency of hepatitis in both refugee and local society.

The CD4 cell count at initiation was the dominant prognostic factor in patients starting HAART. The objective was to identify the effect of HAART on the transition rate between CD4 cell states based on a multi-state Markov model. Methodology: This was an observational cohort study of 305 HIV-positive patients between 1999 and 2014 who were divided into two groups. One group of 179 patients had not received antiretroviral therapy and one group of 126 patients had received HAART. Both had been referred to the Iranian Research Center for HIV/AIDS. Results: HIV-positive patients on HAART showed half the hazard of progression to death than those in the non-HAART group. The rate of recovery from state 2 of CD4 cells to state 1 in the HAART group was significantly greater than in the non-HAART group at HR = 2.5 95% CI: 1.38, 4.70). The probability of recovery after 36 months from each state was estimated using Markov model. Conclusion: It was found that the effect of HAART on the rate of recovery was significant only for patients that begin therapy from a CD4 value of >200 cells/ml. As treatment continued from three to five years, the probability of reconstitution of CD4 cells from <200 cells/ml to a normal nadir increased from 0.53 to 0.61. Our findings have important implications for clinical management and should be taken into account in future treatment guidelines.","[Jambarsang, Sara; Zayeri, Farid] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Fac Paramed Sci, Dept Biostat, Tehran, Iran; [Baghban, Alireza Akbarzadeh] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Sch Rehabil, Dept Basic Sci, Prote Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Zayeri, Farid] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Fac Paramed Sci, Prote Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Nazari, Seyed Saeed Hashemi] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Epidemiol, Tehran, Iran; [Nikfarjam, Ali] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Hlth, Tehran, Iran; [Moradi, Ali] Hamadan Univ Med Sci, Asadabad Hlth & Treatment Network, Hamadan, Iran","Baghban, AA (corresponding author), Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Sch Rehabil, Dept Basic Sci, Prote Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran.",s.jambarsang@sbmu.ac.ir,"Zayeri, Farid/ABA-5531-2020; Jambarsang, Sara/S-2637-2017","Zayeri, Farid/0000-0002-7791-8122; Jambarsang, Sara/0000-0002-8295-7812",,,,16,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,,,,1.0,,927.0,930,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1s_138,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV8ZR,WOS:000424877000007,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods and Materials: The method of this study was descriptive followed by a casual-comparative design. The statistical population of this study included all mothers of children with mental disorders and mothers of physically and mentally disabled children in Zahedan. The statistical sample consisted of 63 mothers of children with mental disorders, including emotional disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, and developmental disorders, selected using the random sampling method. The sample was matched with 63 mothers of physically and mentally disabled children chosen among clients admitted to rehabilitation centers and clinics in Zahedan. These two groups filled out the Garnefski, Kraaij, and Spinhoven Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and the Leahy Emotional Schemas Scale. The obtained data was analyzed using the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Results: The results indicated that compared to the mothers of disabled children, the mothers of children with mental disorders obtained higher scores on self-blame, catastrophizing, and other-blame (the subscales of maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies), putting into perspective (the subscale of adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies), emotional self-awareness, expression of feelings, not being controlled, comprehensibility, simplistic view of emotions, and acceptance of feelings (the subscales of emotional schemas). Conclusion: It can be concluded that using these improper strategies can put these mothers at the risk of mental issues and conflicts. Therefore, through training efficient emotional schemas and adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies, these mothers can be aided to improve their conditions.","[Jenaabadi, Hossein] Univ Sistan & Baluchestan, Fac Educ Sci & Psychol, Dept Educ Sci, Zahedan, Iran","Jenaabadi, H (corresponding author), Univ Sistan & Baluchestan, Fac Educ Sci & Psychol, Dept Educ Sci, Zahedan, Iran.",hjenaabadi@ped.usb.ac.ir,,"Jenaabadi, Hossein/0000-0002-4373-9353",,,,33,0,0,0,12,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,,,,1.0,,887.0,894,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1s_132,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV8ZR,WOS:000424877000001,,,,,2022-07-14

Surgery, recommended as the main choice for the management of HAPA in the past, often associated with high rates of bleeding recurrence and mortality. Recently, transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) has been gradually applied in the treatment of HAPA. However, these studies were mostly case reports and with less efficacy evaluation, the main purpose of this study was to provide more evidence of TAE on the effect of HAPA. Materials and methods: Six HAPA patients with recurrent gastrointestinal or abdominal bleeding were enrolled in this study. Digital subtraction angiography and embolization treatment were performed, and the treatment efficacy was investigated. Of 6 patients, 4 had intrahepatic HAPA and 2 had extrahepatic HAPA. Results: Two patients had major postoperative bleeding after traumatic hepatic rupture repair, and 4 had surgical postoperative bleeding. Five patients had no secondary bleeding after the first embolization; 1 intrahepatic HAPA patient exhibited major bleeding 10 days after intrahepatic embolization, but bleeding stopped after the second embolization. One patient died of liver failure 1 day after the embolization. Conclusions: Angiographic diagnosis and arterial coil embolization achieved a good result of HAPA treatment, which indicated that TAE was a safe and feasible treatment of HAPA.","[Ji, Wen-Bin; Xu, Xin-Jian; Mi, Yu-Cheng] Wenzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Taizhou Hosp, Dept Radiol, Taizhou 317000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wei-Zhen] Wenzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Taizhou Hosp, Dept Vasc Surg, Taizhou 317000, Peoples R China; [Fu, Xin; Chen, Yi-Er; Yang, Song; Tao, Dan; Xu, Wen; Xu, Chao] Wenzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Taizhou Hosp, Vasc Intervent Ctr, Taizhou 317000, Peoples R China","Ji, WB (corresponding author), Wenzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Taizhou Hosp, Dept Radiol, Taizhou 317000, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,28,4,4,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,3.0,,,,,449.0,455,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_3_066,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EV3BF,WOS:000401631200014,,,,,2022-07-14

This disease is classified based on the number of CD4 (cluster of differentiation 4) cells in blood. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate relationship between food group intake and improvement in health status of AIDS patients in Tehran, Iran. Methods: 123 persons with AIDS were selected randomly at four behavioral health specialist centers in Tehran. The personal information was collected by general information questionnaires, and information about food group intake for each person and his family was collected by household food group intake security valid questionnaire; also CD4 cell counts was obtained from medical records of each patient. The relationship between food insecurity and CD4 cells count in patients with HIV infection was evaluated by linear regression method. Results: 83 percent of the participants in this study had inadequate intake of meat group and 67.5 percent of them had inadequate intake of fruits and vegetables group. Inadequate intake of food group was significantly related to CD4 cell counts (P= 0.001). Conclusion: The results suggest that food group intake of AIDS patients is related to CD4 cell counts; and improvement in the nutritional state of AIDS patients may help to prevent deterioration of their condition.","[Kalantari, Naser] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, Tehran, Iran; [Taghynejad, Maryam; Doaei, Saeid] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Natl Nutr & Food Technol Res Inst, Fac Nutr Sci & Food Technol, Students Res Comm, Tehran, Iran; [Gholamalizadeh, Maryam] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Canc Res Ctr, Students Res Comm, Tehran, Iran; [Torkaman, Mahdie] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Chem Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Oraz, Nadia] Tarbit Modares Univ, Food Sci & Technol Dept, Tehran, Iran","Doaei, S (corresponding author), Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Natl Nutr & Food Technol Res Inst, Fac Nutr Sci & Food Technol, Students Res Comm, Tehran, Iran.",,"kalantari, naser/AAA-2857-2022; Doaei, Saeid/X-6425-2018","Doaei, Saeid/0000-0002-2532-7478",Students' Research Committee of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences [5730],This study was funded by the Students' Research Committee of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (grant #5730).

Different parameters have been found to be predictive and prognostic. This study was conducted to investigate the serum levels of interleukin-32 (IL-32) in patients with PA and the relationship with tumor progression and known prognostic parameters. Materials and methods: Thirty-three patients with PA were investigated. Blood samples were obtained from patients with PA at first admission, one month after surgery and two weeks before adjuvant or palliative treatment. Age and sex matched 30 healthy controls were included in the analysis. Serum IL-32 levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The median age at diagnosis was 59 years, range 32-84 years; 20 (61%) patients were men. The tumor was located in the head of the pancreas in 21 (63%) patients. The most common metastatic site was liver in 23 patients with metastasis (n = 19, 83%). The median follow-up time was 26.0 weeks (range: 1.0-184.0 weeks). At the end of the observation period, thirty-two patients (97%) were dead. Thirty-nine percent of 23 metastatic patients who received palliative chemotherapy (CTx) were CTx-responsive. Median overall survival (OS) of the whole group was 41.3 +/- 8.3 weeks [95% confidence interval (CI) = 25-58 weeks]. The baseline serum IL-32 levels were significantly higher in patients with PA than in the control group (p=0.04). Serum IL-32 levels were significantly higher in the patients with liver metastatic disease (p=0.05). Moreover, patients with elevated serum IL-32 concentrations had significantly favorable OS compared with those with lower levels (median 47.2 vs 32.7 weeks, respectively, p = 0.05). Conclusion: Despite new therapies; the prognosis of PA is still poor. There is need to find new parameters. Serum levels of IL-32 may be a good diagnostic and prognostic marker for PA according to our data.","[Karabulut, Mehmet; Peker, Kivanc Derya; Gemici, Eyup] Istanbul Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Gen Surg, Istanbul, Turkey; [Afsar, Cigdem Usul] Acibadem Bakirkoy Hosp, Clin Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Karabulut, Senem] Istanbul Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Dagoglu, Nergiz; Karaman, Sule] Istanbul Univ, Inst Oncol, Dept Radiat Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Yasasever, Ceren Tilgen] Istanbul Univ, Inst Oncol, Dept Basic Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Tas, Faruk] Istanbul Univ, Inst Oncol, Dept Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey","Afsar, CU (corresponding author), Acibadem Bakirkoy Hosp, Clin Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Dagoglu, Nergiz/AAE-7450-2020; Tas, Faruk/AAF-8751-2019; Karaman, Sule/AAS-5135-2020; karabulut, senem/AAT-3594-2020; Yasasever, Ceren Tilgen/A-6547-2018; Peker, Kivanc Derya Derya/D-8801-2015; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/C-3436-2015; Gemici, Eyüp/ABC-5796-2020; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/AAA-6103-2021","Karaman, Sule/0000-0002-4810-4453; Yasasever, Ceren Tilgen/0000-0002-8732-4117; Peker, Kivanc Derya Derya/0000-0002-8887-3505; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639",,,,39,1,1,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,613.0,619,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_091,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700012,,,,,2022-07-14

The majority of esophageal cancers are squamous cell or adenocarcinomas. Although the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is decreasing in the United States, the incidence of adenocarcinoma arising out of Barrett's esophagus is rising dramatically, although less so in the last few years. Treatment in locally advanced EC (LA-EC) must be multidisciplinary. There are only few factors which affects the prognosis. Our aim was to investigate the prognostic and predictive roles of pretreatment neutrophil/leucocyte (neu/leu) ratios in LA-EC patients receiving chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Materials and methods: Sixty patients with non-metastatic EC (youngest 31 years old) who applied to our hospital between 2011 and 2015 were included in this study. Neu/leu ratios were calculated before CRT and after CRT. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for estimating the survival function from lifetime data. In addition, Cox regression model was also used to explore the relationship between the survival of a patient and several explanatory variables. Results: There was statistical significance between neu/leu ratio before CRT and OS (p=0.047). One unit increase in neu/leu ratio, increases the probability of being alive 2.725 times (1/0.367). There was statistical significance between neu/leu ratio before CRT and progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.046). One unit increase in neu/leu ratio, increases the probability of no relapse 3.559 (1/0.281) times. This means that the patients with higher neu/leu ratio before CRT have a lower risk of relapse. Discussion and conclusion: Multimodal therapeutic strategies combining chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery have been shown to be feasible and to have a positive impact on outcomes by decreasing the risk of locoregional recurrence and often by increasing overall survival. The overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of patients is too short in patients with LA-EC. Our study shows that patients with LA-EC who had higher pretreatment neu/leu ratios have better OS and PFS.","[Karaca, Feryal] Adana Numune Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Radiat Oncol, Adana, Turkey; [Afsar, Cigdem Usul] Acibadem Bakirkoy Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Almali, Necat] Van YuzuncuYil Univ, Med Fac, Dept Gen Surg, Van, Turkey; [Karabulut, Senem] Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Karabulut, Mehmet] Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Istanbul, Turkey; [Keskin, Siddik] Van YuzuncuYil Univ, Med Fac, Dept Biostat, Van, Turkey; [Akbulut, Serkan] Adana Numune Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Adana, Turkey","Afsar, CU (corresponding author), Acibadem Bakirkoy Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Afsar, Cigdem Usul/AAA-6103-2021; Akbulut, Serkan/T-5710-2018; karabulut, senem/AAT-3594-2020; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/C-3436-2015","Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639; Akbulut, Serkan/0000-0002-2043-2754; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639",,,,22,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,905.0,911,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_144,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500003,,,,,2022-07-14

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is a more severe form of Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease which is characterised by steatosis, lobular inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis in liver biopsies. In this study, we aimed to investigate any possible relationship between the ABO/Rh blood group system and Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease /Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, in Turkey. Materials and methods: A total of 179 patients with hepatosteatosis from Kayseri Training and Research Hospital between the years 2002-2012 were included in the study. The distributions of blood groups of the patients with Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease were compared with the distribution of blood groups of 17.314 healthy donors. The patients were examined for any association between ABO/Rh blood groups and Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease /Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and also for an association between ABO/Rh blood groups and grading. Results: Group AB was found to be higher in patients with Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease compared to the control group (p=0.04). The percentage of patients with steatohepatitis was significantly higher in group AB than non-AB blood group (p=0.024). The percentage of patients with steatohepatitis was significantly higher in group grade 3 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients than other two -grade 1 and grade 2 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease -groups (<0.001). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first analysis in the literature that investigates the association between the ABO blood groups and Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease /Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. This epidemiological study can not explain the mechanism behind the blood group effect but may be a light for future studies.","[Karagoz, Hatice; Karaman, Ahmet] Acibadem Kayseri Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Kayseri, Turkey; [Erden, Abdulsamet; Ozer, Ozerhan; Cetinkaya, Ali; Avci, Deniz; Gencer, Vedat; Arik, Ferhat; Kalan, Ugur; Gorkem, Hasan] Kayseri Training & Res Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Kayseri, Turkey; [Karaman, Hatice] Kayseri Training & Res Hosp, Dept Clin Pathol, Kayseri, Turkey","Erden, A (corresponding author), Kayseri Training & Res Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Kayseri, Turkey.",,"Karaman, Hatice/AAX-1803-2021; Erden, Abdulsamet/W-2397-2019; ÖZER, ÖZERHAN/O-6794-2015; KARAMAN, HATİCE/AAW-2604-2021; Karagöz, Hatice/AAP-8029-2020","ÖZER, ÖZERHAN/0000-0001-5855-5509; KARAMAN, HATİCE/0000-0002-5250-5663; ",,,,25,2,2,1,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,2.0,,,,,205.0,210,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_2_030,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2RK,WOS:000397230700005,,,,,2022-07-14

Glaucoma crisis is also a rare complication observed after extraocular surgery. Material methods: The patient is 55 years-old, female without preexisting eye complaints. We evaluated the open angle glaucoma crisis developing after hip arthroscopy performed due to right hip labrum tear. The onset of post-arthroscopic symptoms was at 24 hours. The ophtalmological consultation revealed an indication for ocular surgery. Discussion: Glaucoma crisis may ocur due to any reason in all extraocular surgeries. Permanent vision loss can be prevented with early diagnosis and treatment. Glaucoma should be considered in patients having postoperative headache, visual disorder, nausea and other eye complaints so that an ophtalmological consultation should follow to enable an immediate treatment.","[Karakas, Dursun] Gisbir Special Hosp, Orthopaed Div, Istanbul, Turkey; [Demiroglu, Murat] IstanbulGoztepe Training Hosp, Orthopaed, Istanbul, Turkey","Karakas, D (corresponding author), Care of Caddesi E, Goztepe Arastirma Hastanesi, Istanbul, Turkey.",,,,,,,12,1,1,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,5.0,,,,,811.0,813,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_5_120,,3,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FA9PC,WOS:000405777000014,,,,,2022-07-14

We investigated the significance of IL-17 and IL-23 in the pathogenesis of by chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis measuring the levels of these proinflammatory cytokines in serum and nasal lavage samples. Materials and methods: Twenty-five patients aged >18 years with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and a control group with 25 healthy subjects were included the study. The levels of IL-17 and IL-23 were measured in the serum and nasal lavage fluids using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: The average serum level of IL-17 was 10.2 pg/ml in the study group, and it was 5.0 pg/ml in the control group. The average nasal lavage level of IL-17 was 16.8 pg/ml in the study group compared with 1.0 pg/ml in the control group. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the serum levels of IL-17 or IL-23; however, a significant difference between the two groups was found in the lavage fluid levels of IL-17 (p < 0.001). Conclusion: We found a significant difference in the nasal lavage fluid levels of IL-17, which demonstrates the importance of local inflammation. This supports the hypothesis that IL-17 is significant in the pathogenesis of nasal polyposis.","[Koca, Rahime; Osma, Ustun; Yilmaz, Mustafa Deniz; Selcuk, Omer Tarik; Renda, Levent] Antalya Educ & Res Hosp, Dept ENT Head & Neck Surg, Antalya, Turkey; [Eyigor, Mete; Eyigor, Hulya; Gultekin, Meral] Akdeniz Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Antalya, Turkey","Selcuk, OT (corresponding author), Antalya Educ & Res Hosp, ENT Dept, Antalya, Turkey.",,"Selcuk, Omer/AAJ-3450-2021; Eyigor, Mete/C-1251-2016","Selcuk, Omer/0000-0002-7364-7599; ",Antalya Education and Research Hospital,The study was funded by Antalya Education and Research Hospital<SUP>1</SUP>,,30,2,2,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,2.0,,,,,211.0,216,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_2_031,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2RK,WOS:000397230700006,,,,,2022-07-14

The aim of this study is to identify whether their is a significant relationship between mean value of platelet volume obtained from complete blood cell count of the patients diagnosed with haemorrhagic stroke, corpuscular distribution volume value and bleeding volume value identified in the computed tomography scans of the head. Material and method: The sample of the study consisted of all patients aged above 18 and diagnosed with haemorrhagic stroke who applied to Emergency Unit at Adana Numune Education and Research Hospital between 1, June 2014 and 30, July 2016. Results: The sample included 86 patients with haemorrhagic stroke. The sample consisted of 58 % (n=50) male and 41,9 % (n=36) female. The mean value for the patients' ages was 60,4 +/- 16,5. Among the patients, 60,5 % (n=52) of them were observed to have applied to the emergency service with sudden clouding of consciousness. A high majority of patients these (79,5 %) were later exitus. The mean value of red cells distribution volume of the patients with exitus was significantly higher than those of surviving patients' (p<0,05). Parenchymal bleeding was observed to exist in 55,8 % (n=48) of the patients. The mortality rate for the patients with high bleeding volume was higher. Conclusion: Impaired consciousness, existence of hypertension, high corpuscular distribution and bleeding volume can be among the factors affecting mortality.","[Komurcu, Ozkan] Sehit Kamil State Hosp, Emergency Med Serv, Gaziantep, Turkey; [Avci, Akkan; Gulen, Muge; Ozer, Ali Ilker; Ulger, Huseyin; Satar, Salim] Health Sci Univ, Adana Numune Training & Res Hosp, Adana, Turkey; [Kocer, Mursel] Balikligol State Hosp, Emergency Serv, Sanliurfa, Turkey","Avci, A (corresponding author), Hlth Sci Univ, Adana Numune Training & Res Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, TR-01240 Adana, Turkey.",,,,,,,37,3,3,2,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,3.0,,,,,527.0,533,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_3_078,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EV3BF,WOS:000401631200026,,,,,2022-07-14

Contact with blood or body secretions of viremic humans or animals is also among the other modes of transmission. In this study, the serological states in terms of CCHF tested in healthcare workers (HCW) who had had contact with two fatal patients with a diagnosis of CCHF. The relation of the transmission possibility with the phylogenetic analysis of the virus were evaluated. Materials and methods: CCHF IgM and IgG were investigated with ELISA one month after contact with index cases in HCW. The contact levels and states of use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were evaluated. Phylogenetic analysis with sequence analysis based on partial sequences of NP coding region was performed for CCHF viruses detected in the index cases. Results: CCHF IgM and IgG were found negative in any of 20 healthcare workers some of whom had a history of high-risk contact. The sequence analysis revealed that the viruses found in both patients were identical. Phylogenetic evaluation showed that both viruses have high homology with the viruses which were determined previously in the endemic area in Turkey. Conclusion: As in our study, detection of virus topotype with sequence analysis in studies about nosocomial transmission will help to determine if there is a difference between virus subtypes in terms of transmission.","[Kuscu, Ferit; Komur, Suheyla; Ulu, Aslihan; Inal, Ayse Seza; Kurtaran, Behice; Tasova, Yesim; Aksu, Hasan Salih Zeki] Cukurova Univ, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol, Adana, Turkey; [Caglayik, Dilek Yagci] Publ Hlth Inst Turkey, Natl Arbovirus & Viral Zoonoses Reference & Res L, Ankara, Turkey; [Caglayik, Dilek Yagci] Marmara Univ, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ozkul, Aykut] Ankara Univ, Fac Vet Med, Dept Virol, Ankara, Turkey","Kuscu, F (corresponding author), Cukurova Univ, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol, Adana, Turkey.",,"Kuscu, Ferit/L-2974-2016; Inal, Ayse Seza/B-7367-2016; Taşova, Yeşim/H-5871-2018; kömür, süheyla/E-9639-2018; Candevir, Aslihan/A-8016-2015; Çağlayık, Dilek Yağcı/AAD-5747-2020; Ozkul, Aykut/A-1973-2016; Kurtaran, Behice/E-9577-2018","Kuscu, Ferit/0000-0001-5662-8305; Inal, Ayse Seza/0000-0002-1182-7164; Candevir, Aslihan/0000-0001-9340-516X; Çağlayık, Dilek Yağcı/0000-0003-3473-8073; Ozkul, Aykut/0000-0001-5008-9443; Kurtaran, Behice/0000-0002-2081-4664",,,,29,3,3,0,8,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,575.0,580,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_084,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700005,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: Preparation of VRT thermosensitive liposomes was carried out by pH gradient method. The VRT content in liposomes was determined by high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). Separation of liposomes and free drugs was done with microcolumn centrifugation method. The influence on type of dextrangel and elution solvent as well as eluted volume of vinorelbine tartrate and free drug was closely observed. Results: The average particle size and average content of vinorelbine tartrate were (94.8 +/- 1.5) nm, (1.84 +/- 0.04) mg/mL respectively. The dextrangel G-25 was used for preparation of microcolumn, in which 4 cm was the best column height. The elution solvent used was PBS buffer and gradient elution volume method was employed in separation of liposomes and free drugs. The encapsulation efficiency of three batches vinorelbine tartrate were recorded as (95.76 +/- 1.43)%, (91.13 +/- 1.24)% and (94.13 +/- 2.05)%, with respective elution recovery rate at (98.5 +/- 2.41)%, (93.6 +/- 1.85)% and 96.8 +/- 1.67)%.

Aim of the study is to study the structure and function of ferredoxin laid a theoretical foundation for understanding energy accumulation, metabolism and electron transfer of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. Materials and methods: Eleven kinds of ferredoxin sequences were downloaded from the NCBI database. Aspects concluding basic physicochemical properties, conserved domain, protein modification, subcellular localization, advanced structures prediction, homology and protein interaction network were predicted on the application of combination of software and online tools. Results: The results showed that all proteins were electrically neutral in acidic solution except ACK80487.1. Minority of the proteins (three to eleven) were hydrophilic protein. Majority of the proteins were unstable with exceptions of ACK79455.1 & ACK80389.1. The cytoplasm was the place where they played a part. Through the comprehensive forecast, four proteins were involved in nitrogen fixation reaction; two proteins mainly participated in iron sulfur-cluster assembly; four from eleven took effect in oxidation and reduction reactions; the rest one play a major role in nucleic acid reaction. Conclusion: The basic physicochemical properties, the secondary structure and tertiary structure of protein, subcellular localization, signal peptide and transmembrane domain analysis showed the protein was characterized by diversity and implied the complexity of electron transfer and energy mechanism of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans","[Leng, Feifan; Luo, Wen; Jing, Yanjun; Li, Yuanli; Wei, Qingwei; Yang, Mingjun; Wang, Yonggang] Lanzhou Univ Technol, Sch Life Sci & Engn, Lanzhou 730050, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Ebadi, Abdol Ghaffar] Islamic Azad Univ, Jouybar Branch, Dept Agr, Jouybar, Iran","Leng, FF; Wang, YG (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ Technol, Sch Life Sci & Engn, Lanzhou 730050, Gansu, Peoples R China.",,"Ebadi, Abdol Ghaffar/AAV-9463-2021","Ebadi, Abdol Ghaffar/0000-0003-4472-5866","Chinese National Natural Science Foundation [31460032, 81660581]","The authors would like to give thanks to the participants, coordinators and administrators for their support during the study.

After reviewing the existing literature systematically, we discussed the association between inflammatory cytokine polymorphisms and cancer-related fatigue (CRF). Methods: We conducted a search on the association of inflammatory cytokine polymorphisms and cancer-related fatigue in PubMed, ISI Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), the Chinese Journal Full-text Database (CJFD) and the Wanfang Database. Studies were selected using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. We finished the manuscript followed the checklist of PRISMA statement. Results: We identified 15 studies in the published literature that specifically assessed the association between fatigue and inflammatory cytokine polymorphisms in cancer patients. There were 13 studies exploring positive associations between inflammatory cytokine polymorphisms and CRF. Because of the heterogeneity of these studies in terms of cancer type, cancer-related fatigue measures, diagnosis of CRF, and selection of controls, it was difficult to merge correlation estimates between inflammatory cytokine polymorphisms and cancer-related fatigue for a quantitative review and clear results. Nevertheless, the present review evaluated the gaps of knowledge in this topic to advance CRF research. Conclusion: Future efforts should define CRF and select appropriate questionnaires for CRF measures and controls. Publications in this field have focused on single race (e. g. the white) and a few cancer type(e. g. breast and lung cancer). Therefore, additional studies should be performed in other races and cancer types to obtain more convincing evidence. Meanwhile, the development of clear definition and unified questionnaires of CRF is an important avenue for future research.","[Li, Zhaoxia; Mi, Denghai] Lanzhou Univ, Clin Med Coll 1, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhaoxia; Mi, Denghai; Wen, Zhizhen] Second Hosp Gansu Prov, Lanzhou, Peoples R China","Mi, DH (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Clin Med Coll 1, Lanzhou, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,46,6,6,2,15,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,1.0,,,,,41.0,47,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1_006,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2PY,WOS:000397226800006,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: We conducted a search for case-control studies on the association of TNF-a-308 polymorphism with susceptibility to HCC in PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Chinese Journal Full-text Database (CJFD) and Wanfang Database. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to estimate the strength of the association between TNF-a-308 polymorphism and the risk for HCC. Results: 24 studies were identified, including 4,331 HCC patients and 7,254 controls. Our results demonstrated a significant association between TNF-a-308 polymorphism and HCC risk in all genetic models while the control group was HCC-free. Howeve, when removing the data about healthy control, the pooled ORs were significantly decreased in the additive model (AA versus GG) and the allele model (G versus A), even no significant differences were observed in the rest genetic models. In an analysis stratified by ethnicity, increased risks were observed in both Asian and Caucasian populations. Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that TNF-a-308 GG genotype might decrease the risk of HCC development, specifically among both Asian and Caucasian populations. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because of heterogeneity of control populations. Well-designed studies with appropriate controls, larger sample sizes and more in-depth data are required to confirm this conclusion.","[Li, Zhaoxia; Mi, Denghai] Lanzhou Univ, Clin Med Coll 1, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhaoxia; Mi, Denghai] Second Hosp Gansu Prov, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Gang] Hosp Gansu Prov, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Ma, Bin] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Basic Sci, Evidence Based Med Ctr, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Li] Gansu Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Coll Publ Hlth, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China","Mi, DH (corresponding author), 222 Tianshui Rd, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China.",,,,Gansu province health department [GSWSKY-2014-14],This work was supported by the funding plan from the Gansu province health department (grant numbers: GSWSKY-2014-14).,,49,2,2,1,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,1007.0,1015,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_160,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500019,,,,,2022-07-14

We collected the clinical data of a total of 1025 cases of patients with shoulder joint bankart injury caused by swimming and treated in twenty medical units from January 2014 to December 2015 for a retrospective analysis. All patients voluntarily accepted shoulder arthroscopic anchor implantation and fixation. To further clarify for the effect of treatment, shoulder injury pain degree and athletic ability level of patients before and after treatment were statistically compared. Also, by 6 months' follow-up, stability of the treatment effect was evaluated. The results showed that shoulder arthroscopic anchor implantation and fixation enjoyed very significant effect for shoulder joint bankart injury caused by swimming, with significant improvements in shoulder function scores and pain scores after treatment. Differences before and after treatment were statistically significant (p < 0.05); in addition, after 3 months of treatment, 991 cases of patients had a stable efficacy, without recurring injury and with effective treatment rate at 96.68%; 34 cases of patients had recurrence of shoulder injury, with a recurrence rate at 3.32%. As can be seen from the treatment results, shoulder arthroscopic anchor implantation and fixation showed a significant treatment effect for shoulder joint bankart injury caused by swimming, which can effectively help patients restore joint function, reduce pain in patients, with a high application value and good therapeutic effect.","[Liao, Jun; Deng, Yingjie; Ailijiang, Asila; Liu, Zhenfeng; Meng, Qingcai; Xiang, Wenyuan; Yu, Haicheng; Fang, Rui] Chinese Med Hosp Xinjiang, Dept Orthopaed, Uygur Autonomous Region, Urumqi, Peoples R China","Fang, R (corresponding author), Chinese Med Hosp Xinjiang, Dept Orthopaed, Uygur Autonomous Region, Urumqi, Peoples R China.",jndkhkiu@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [81160460];  [ZYYBZ2013],National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 81160460).; Postdoctoral Research Fund (No. ZYYBZ2013).,,14,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,,,,3.0,,1309.0,1312,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_3s_202,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AC,WOS:000424878100004,,,,,2022-07-14

Bone disease occurs in approximately 80% of patients with newly diagnosed MM. The cervical spine is the least common site of disease involvement. Case presentation: A 60-year-old female patient was referred to the Department of Neurosurgery for bone pain. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed a pathological fracture of the sixth cervical vertebra (C6). The laboratory tests and the bone marrow examination led to a diagnosis of IgA x MM (Durie Salmon stage IIIA). The patient underwent a cervical arthrodesis and started systemic Bortezomib-Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (VTD) combination chemotherapy. During chemiotherapic treatment the patient underwent a vertebroplasty of L4-L5. After 4 VTD cycles, the patient was dismissed showing a very good partial remission (VGPR). Later the patient subjected herself to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) obtaining a complete remission. Discussion: We report a clinical case of MM in which the fracture of cervical spine represents the clinical onset. Indeed this clinical presentation is not common in this type of monoclonal gammopathy. This case underlines the importance of suspecting MM in all cases of compromised bone.","[Lo Sasso, Bruna; Agnello, Luisa; Butera, Daniela; Scazzone, Concetta; Bivona, Giulia; Bellia, Chiara; Ciaccio, Marcello] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Biopatol & Biotecnol Med, Sez Biochim Clin & Med Mol Clin, Palermo, Italy; [Florena, Ada Maria; Giannone, Antonino Giulio; Ciaccio, Marcello] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Promoz Salute & Materno Infantil, Palermo, Italy; [Pappalardo, Emanuela; Milano, Salvatore; Ciaccio, Marcello] Azienda Osped Univ Policlin P Giaccone Palermo, Dipartimento Diagnost Lab, CoreLab, UOC Med Lab, Via Vespro Palermo, Palermo, Italy","Ciaccio, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Policlin Univ, Dipartimento Biopatol & Biotecnol Med, Sez Biochim Clin & Med Mol Clin, Via Vespro,129, I-90127 Palermo, Italy.",,"Bellia, Chiara/AAO-3725-2020; Giannone, Antonino Giulio/K-2713-2018; scazzone, concetta/J-9541-2018","Bellia, Chiara/0000-0003-0611-9363; Giannone, Antonino Giulio/0000-0002-1219-627X; scazzone, concetta/0000-0001-7424-8066; BIVONA, Giulia/0000-0003-1723-3305",,,,15,1,1,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,3.0,,,,,535.0,538,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_3_079,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EV3BF,WOS:000401631200027,,,,,2022-07-14

The incidence of P. aeruginosa has been increased in recent years and its virulence factors are various. The aim of this study was to compare the differences of the virulence factors in pigmented and non-pigmented P. aeruginosa isolates. Materials and methods: Isolates of patients that were identified as P. aeruginosa were included into the study. Strains of patients (n: 100) were divided into two groups according to pigment production. Antibiotic susceptibility tests of all strains were performed by disk diffusion method. DNase, protease, elastase, hemolysis and motility tests were performed as phenotypic tests. The presence of several virulence-associated genes encoding exotoxins T (exoT), S (exoS), U (exoU) and Y (exoY) and quorum sensing mediators (rhlA and rhlB) were assessed by Real-time PCR method for genotypic identification. The relationship between pigment production, antibiotic resistance and virulence factors were examined. Results: There was no significant difference between pigmented and non-pigmented isolates when elastolytic activity and mucus production were compared. Pigmented isolates produced significantly more (p<0.05) protease and hemolysis activity. Motility was present in pigmented isolates more frequently than in non-pigmented isolates. DNase activity was significant in pigmented isolates then non-pigmented isolates (p<0.05). Antibiotic resistance was present more frequently in non-pigmented isolates than pigmented isolates. Pigmented isolates had more frequently and significant more (p<0.05) virulence-associated genes rhlB, exoS, exoY (p<0.05). Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that both phenotypic and genotypic virulence factors may be associated with the pigment production in P. aeruginosa. Pigment production is easy to determine, which might be a good starting point to identify the virulence status of an isolate.","[Macin, Salih] Sirnak State Hosp, Microbiol Lab, Sirnak, Turkey; [Akyon, Yakut] Hacettepe Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Ankara, Turkey","Macin, S (corresponding author), Sirnak State Hosp, Microbiol Lab, Sirnak, Turkey.",,"Macin, Salih/H-4850-2017; YILMAZ, YAKUT AKYON/I-8298-2013; Macin, Salih/P-2881-2019","Macin, Salih/0000-0002-1871-3629; YILMAZ, YAKUT AKYON/0000-0002-0919-5508; ",Hacettepe University Scientific Research Fund [17388665/285],"We thank Onur Karatuna for providing P. aeruginosa PAO-1, PAO-JP2 and PAO-JP3 strains.

In homicides committed by criminal organization, the method used intends to be an admonition to other persons. We analyze the criminal organization named Mafia of Gargano, that is a promontory of Apulia Region, in South-East of Italy. We analyze its homicidal mode, the type of weapon used in murders, the drawn body sites and the action recurrence. Previously named Faida of Gargano, the Garganic Mafia was certified by legal court as an inveterate mafia system only in 2009. In fact, in the Garganic area an archaic and violent mafia arise for theft of animals; subsequently, the most profitable activities of these clans became drug and weapons trafficking. The Garganic Mafia is an extremely traditional Mafia, like Camorra, with particularly practices of cadaver concealment. Very often, utilizing natural conformation of Gargano promontory, the criminals throw away the bodies into natural canyons. In this manner, the cadavers are discovered after many years accidentally: this method was classified as Lupara Bianca. Another kind of Apulia's Mafia is the so called Sacra Corona Unita (SCU). Originally it was founded by the Camorra's boss but it's inspired by Calabrian 'Ndrangheta: both these mafia associations was found in south of Italy, Camorra in Campania Region and 'Ndragheta in Calabria Region. In the murders committed by the SCU was frequent the recourse to deception to attract the victim, the use of the gun and the method of Lupara Bianca with the burning of the body. As previously described, the kind of the murder represents the signature of the mafia organization. These finding are very useful for investigations, helping to identify crime's motivations and the correlation with suspects.","[Maglietta, Francesca; Sessa, Francesco; Albano, Giuseppe Davide; Bertozzi, Giuseppe; Salerno, Monica] Univ Foggia, Sect Forens Pathol, Clin & Expt Med Dept, DAvanzo Hosp, Viale Aviatori 1, Foggia, Italy; [Giugliano, Pasquale] UOC, St Anna & San Sebastiano Hosp, Legal Med, Palasciano St, Caserta, Italy; [Vacchiano, Giuseppe] Sannio Univ, Dept Law Econ Math Methods, UOC, Benevento, Italy; [Marsala, Gabriella] Azienda Osped Univ, Struttura Complessa Farm, Osped Riuniti Foggia, Foggia, Italy","Salerno, M (corresponding author), Univ Foggia, Sect Forens Pathol, Clin & Expt Med Dept, Osped Colonnello DAvanzo, Viale Aviatori 1, I-71100 Foggia, Italy.",,"Sessa, Francesco/G-1754-2018; Bertozzi, Giuseppe/AAS-9882-2020; SALERNO, MONICA/AAC-1321-2019","Sessa, Francesco/0000-0003-0357-8791; Bertozzi, Giuseppe/0000-0002-8179-1072; SALERNO, MONICA/0000-0002-6410-3960; Maglietta, Francesca/0000-0001-7240-5902; Giugliano, Pasquale/0000-0002-3633-8893",,,,47,7,7,0,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,947.0,952,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_149,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500008,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods and results: The presence of cadF, ciaB, racR, cdtA, cdtB, cdtC, and pldA virulence genes among 36 Campylobacter jejuni and 14 Campylobacter coli isolates was detected by polymerase chain reaction. The isolates were screened for the presence of seven virulence genes-namely cadF, racR, ciaB, cdtA, cdtB, cdtC, and pldA-which are responsible for adherence, colonization, invasion, and cytotoxin production in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. The isolates showed wide variation in the presence of these genes. The prevalence of cadF, ciaB, racR, cdtA, cdtB, cdtC, and pldA virulence genes in poultry were 74.36%, 76.92%, 84.61%, 69.23%, 84.62%, 84.62%, and 76.92%, respectively. The prevalence of cadF, ciaB, racR, cdtA, cdtB, cdtC, and pldA virulence genes in cow were 55.56%, 55.56%, 100%, 77.78%, 88.89%, 88.89%, and 88.89%, respectively. The prevalence of cadF, ciaB, racR, cdtA, cdtB, cdtC, and pldA virulence genes in sheep were 0%, 100%, 100%, 0%, 100%, 50%, and 100%, respectively. Conclusions: A high prevalence of ciaB, racR, cdtB, cdtC, and pldA genes was found. Significance and Impact of the Study: The high prevalence of ciaB, racR, cdtB, cdtC, and pldA genes demonstrated that these putative pathogenic determinants are widespread among Campylobacter isolates from poultry, cow, and sheep. The results emphasized that Campylobacter strains in poultry, cow, and sheep have potential pathogenic properties for humans.","[Mahmoodipour, Hamid] Islamic Azad Univ, Fars Sci & Res Branch, Dept Microbiol, Fars, Iran; [Mahmoodipour, Hamid] Islamic Azad Univ, Shiraz Branch, Dept Microbiol, Shiraz, Iran; [Baserisalehi, Majid] Islamic Azad Univ, Kazeroun Branch, Dept Microbiol, Kazeroun, Iran; [Emami, Amir] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Dept Burn & Wound Healing, Res Ctr, Shiraz, Iran","Baserisalehi, M (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Kazeroun Branch, Dept Microbiol, Kazeroun, Iran.",majidbaseri@hotmail.com,"Emami, Amir/H-1024-2016; mahmoodipour, hamid/N-5737-2015","Emami, Amir/0000-0002-4510-1820; baserisalehi, majid/0000-0003-2194-4257; mahmoodipour, hamid/0000-0003-4581-7519",,,,22,1,1,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,5.0,,,,,763.0,768,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_5_112,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FA9PC,WOS:000405777000006,,,,,2022-07-14

The resistance against chlorine and biofilm formation is among the important factors involved in colonization of these bacteria in water. Environmental mycobacteria cause different types of diseases especially pulmonary diseases due to their transfer to humans. The isolation and identification of these bacteria and the knowledge of how species are spread out as well as the identification of the dominant species in different geographical regions are necessary to be paid attention to because of differences in strategies for treating diseases caused by them. Different methods for isolating environmental mycobacteria have been employed by different researchers, but no standard method has been suggested for this isolation yet. Therefore, in the present study, in addition to introducing an ideal protocol, other studies related to the isolation of these bacteria from water resources were investigated, among which three top methods were selected and introduced. In addition, effective factors such as the type and concentration of disinfectants, the type of water processing, the type of culture medium, their pH, and incubation temperature involved in isolating bacteria are mentioned. Conclusion: using the filtration method instead of centrifuge one, using disinfectant of the cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) instead of other disinfectants, using the Lowenstein-Jensen culture medium with an acidic pH, incubation in temperature of 30 degrees C and incubation duration are among factors affecting in the isolation of environmental mycobacteria from the water sample.","[Maleki, Mehdi Roshdi; Harzandi, Naser] Islamic Azad Univ, Karaj Branch, Dept Microbiol, Coll Sci, Alborz, Iran; [Kafil, Hossein Samadi] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Drug Appl Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran; [Moaddab, Seyyed Reza] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Fac Paramed, Dept Lab Sci, Tabriz, Iran","Moaddab, SR (corresponding author), Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Fac Paramed, Dept Lab Sci, Tabriz, Iran.",,"Samadi Kafil, Hossein/AAX-2888-2021; Kafil, Hossein Samadi/B-5855-2012; Maleki, Mehdi Roshdi/AAN-2526-2021","Kafil, Hossein Samadi/0000-0001-6026-8795; Maleki, Mehdi Roshdi/0000-0002-3846-4770",,,,18,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,,,,1.0,,909.0,913,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1s_135,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV8ZR,WOS:000424877000004,,,,,2022-07-14

To carry out the present study, in order to assess personality, self-esteem, mood and visual-spatial skills of sample, the following psychological assessment tests were used: 1) Big Five Questionnaire for Children, 2) Multidimensional Self-esteem Test, 3) Profile of Mood States-Adolescent, and 4) Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test. The study was performed at the sports center Torre del Grifo Village (Mascalucia, Italy). Results: The study has showed, in both groups of athletes, the presence of personological features oriented to establish friendly and cooperative relations; what it makes us conclude that within the two teams there are positive relationships between athletes, also aimed at achieving the common goal, and that the group component is crucial. It is also seen that in the synchronized swimming team the individual dimension emerges strongly, in terms of athletic competition spirit. Conclusion: The comparison between the two groups showed that the water polo seems to encourage the development of visual-spatial skills, compared to synchronized swimmers.

Spine is a common site for skeletal metastases. Case presentation: A 53-years-old male was admitted to our Neurosurgical unit because of an untreatable dorsal pain. He had been treated 3 years before for breast cancer. A dorsal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) evidenced pathological masses at T8 level. A total body Computed Tomography (CT) scan revealed lungs and liver metastases. After a multidisciplinary consult, a posterior T8 decompression, a radiofrequency thermoablation in T8 vertebral body followed by screws and rods fixation (T7-T9) was performed. Post-operative course was uneventful and the patient experienced a significant improvement of dorsal pain. Cycles of adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy followed. After 8 months, patient is still alive and in good general conditions but a spine MRI revealed a rapid and widespread diffusion of ostelytic metastases. Conclusion: Despite the high incidence of breast cancer metastases to the spine, very few clinical reports (just eight, whose only one treated surgically) in the literature deal specifically with metastases from male breast cancer, which is rarer and with a worst prognosis than female counterpart. In spite of the poor course, surgery still plays a role in treating these kind of malignancies and in improving quality of life.","[Maugeri, Rosario; Giammalva, Giuseppe Roberto; Guli, Carlo; Graziano, Francesca; Basile, Luigi; Giugno, Antonella; Iacopino, Domenico Gerardo] Univ Palermo, Dept Expt Biomed & Clin Neurosci, Sch Med, Neurosurg Clin, Palermo, Italy; [Cicero, Giuseppe; de Luca, Rossella] Univ Palermo, Dept Surg Oncol & Oral Sci, DICHIRONS, Policlin Paolo Giaccone, Palermo, Italy; [Cicero, Giuseppe; de Luca, Rossella] Univ Palermo, Palermo, Italy","Cicero, G (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Surg Oncol & Oral Sci, Med Oncol, Via Vespro 129, I-90127 Palermo, Italy.",,"graziano, francesca/AAP-6443-2020; Giammalva, Giuseppe Roberto/R-7941-2016; Iacopino, Domenico/C-1539-2013","Giammalva, Giuseppe Roberto/0000-0001-6309-8963; Iacopino, Domenico/0000-0003-1685-5209; Graziano, Francesca/0000-0001-8754-6572; De Luca, Rossella/0000-0001-7116-3366",,,,31,3,3,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,1157.0,1161,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_181,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500040,,,,,2022-07-14

These infections cause significant morbidity and mortality. In this study, it is aimed to evaluate the epidemiologic features, risk factors and antifungal susceptibility of candidemia cases in a tertiary-care hospital. Materials and methods: Between January 1, 2012 and March 1, 2016, the data of patients with candidemia were recorded in a previously prepared form in a tertiary-care hospital. In the same period, cases without candidemia were taken as control group. Candidemia cases and control group were compared in terms of epidemiological characteristics and possible risk factors. SPSS 16.0 program was used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean age of 60 patients diagnosed with candidemia was 57.3 +/- 18.3, 37 (61.7%) were males and 23 (38.3%) were females. The mean age of the 60 patients in the control group was 58.6 +/- 16.6, 35 (58.3%) were male and 25 (41.7%) were female. The most common isolated Candida species were C. albicans (48,3%), C. glabrata (13,3%), C. parapsilosis (10,0%), C. crusei (8% 3), C. tropicalis (8,3%), Candida spp. (5%), C. lipolytica (1.7%) and C. famota (1.7%). Amphotericin B resistance rate was 10.40% for C. albicans, 9.7% for non-albicans, fluconazole resistance rate was 3.5% for C. albicans, 19.4% for non-albicans, voriconazole resistance rate was 7,00% for C. albicans. No resistance was found in non-albicans species. There was no resistance to caspofungin, itraconazole and micafungin. According to the results of antifungal susceptibility, there was no increased resistance among Candida species compared to previous years. Conclusions: In this study, total parenteral nutrition and the use of piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem and imipenem were the most frequent risk factors for Candida-associated bloodstream infections. The most frequently isolated species was Candida albicans. The proportion of total non-albicans species was high as a result.","[Mert, Duygu; Yilmaz, Gul Ruhsar; Ceken, Sabahat; Iskender, Gulsen; Ertek, Mustafa] Dr Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Oncol Training &, Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol Clin, Ankara, Turkey; [Yenigun, Ayla] Dr Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Oncol Training &, Med Microbiol Lab, Ankara, Turkey","Mert, D (corresponding author), Dr Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Oncol Training &, Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol Clin, Ankara, Turkey.",,"ceken, sabahat/ABA-5328-2020",,,,,26,1,1,2,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,5.0,,,,,815.0,820,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_5_121,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FA9PC,WOS:000405777000015,,,,,2022-07-14

Orexins play an significant role in regulating arousal and attention. The term arousal refers to a person's general state of alertness or excitation, both physiological and psychological. Arousal levels ranges on a continuum from drowsiness through alertness to excitement. Orexin plays an important role in the regulation of feeding behaviour. The orexin stimulates food intake and reduces the metabolic rate, increasing and maintaining the body's energy reserves. Orexins play also a fundamental role in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle by increasing arousal levels and maintaining wakefulness. Its deficit can cause narcolepsy.

Heating of body tissues by radiofrequency (RF) energy is a mechanism for therapeutic. Such effects may be produced by local changes in tissue temperature (for example, thermally induced changes in regional blood flow) and others may be systemic effects due to the additional thermal load on the body. An elevated core temperature increases metabolism and certain other functions such as heart rate, respiration rate, and nerve conduction velocity The aim of this study was to determine whether healthy subjects, non-obese, undergoing treatment with radiofrequency could see changes in REE and SNA, GSR. Twenty healthy adult female, took part in the study. The study protocol consisted of the treatment of twenty minutes of radiofrequency in the abdominal region. Participants in the study were presented in the morning at 8 am fasting for at least 12 h, underwent measurement of REE, HRV and GSR 60 minutes prior to treatment, immediately after treatment, and 120 minutes after treatment. Radiofrequency induced significant increases of REE, sympathetic activity, and GSR. This result is also useful in the interpretation of the relationship between the sympathetic nervous system and food intake in young subjects. It has demonstrated a significant influence of sympathetic activity on eating behavior, also through an increase in thermogenesis.","[Messina, Antonietta; Monda, Vincenzo; Villano, Ines] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Expt Med, Caserta, Italy; [Russo, Gianluca] Univ Foggia, Italian Soc Nonablat Radiofrequency, Foggia, Italy; [Valenzano, Anna; Moscatelli, Fiorenzo; Cibelli, Giuseppe; Messina, Giovanni] Univ Foggia, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Foggia, Italy; [Ascione, Antonio] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Motor Sci & Wellness, Naples, Italy; [Crescenzo, Romoaldo; Catizzone, Anna Rosa; Panico, Annalisa; Fulgione, Elisabetta; Piombino, Laura; Dorato, Dario] Univ Naples Federico II, Italian Soc Aesthet Med, Naples, Italy; [Cavaliere, Gina; Trinchese, Giovanna] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Biol, Naples, Italy","Messina, A (corresponding author), Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Expt Med, Caserta, Italy.",antonietta.messina@unicampania.it,"Cibelli, Giuseppe/AAC-2635-2019; Messina, Antonietta/AHH-2383-2022; Ascione, Antonio/I-9473-2018; Moscatelli, Fiorenzo/ABC-9536-2020; MESSINA, ANTONIETTA/K-9366-2016; Giovanna, Trinchese/AAC-5995-2022","Messina, Antonietta/0000-0001-8343-432X; Ascione, Antonio/0000-0003-4466-1807; Giovanna, Trinchese/0000-0002-4096-6876; Monda, Vincenzo/0000-0002-6083-5814; CIBELLI, GIUSEPPE/0000-0002-5371-2584; VILLANO, INES/0000-0002-1755-358X; Moscatelli, Fiorenzo/0000-0003-1274-0332",,,,69,23,23,1,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,5.0,,,,,833.0,840,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_5_124,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FA9PC,WOS:000405777000018,,,,,2022-07-14

Nevertheless their role for the prognosis of patients early after an acute cardiovascular event has not been fully elucidated. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of HTN, dyslipidemia, DM and smoking on the early prognosis of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Materials and methods: We included 682 consecutive patients with AMI, mean age 66.6 +/- 12.9 years. Detailed information was collected about the cardiovascular RF of the patients, concomitant diseases, demographic and socio-economic data. Results: Acute myocardial infarction with persistent ST-elevation was diagnosed in 344 (50.4%) patients. Arterial hypertension was present in 589 (86.4%), dyslipidemia -347 (50.9%), active smoking -178 (26.1%), type 2 DM -171 (25.1%). In-hospital mortality was 13.6% (n= 89): 14.1% (n= 46) for ST-elevation AMI and 12.7% (n= 38) for non-ST-elevation AMI, p= N. S. The impact of the analyzed RF on the early prognosis, demonstrated by the odds ratio (OR) for lethal outcome was as follows: HTN -OR = 3.19, p< 0.0001, DM -OR = 2.20, p = 0.003, dyslipidemia -OR = 1.80, p= 0.03, active smoking -OR = 0.35, p = 0.005. Conclusion: Prevalence of HTN, dyslipidemia, type 2 DM and active smoking in patients with AMI in our study was high with HTN being the most influential RF in regard to the early post-infarction prognosis. While the first three RF were associated with increased early mortality, surprisingly active smoking reduced the risk for unfavourable outcome.","[Milanova, Maria Hristova] UMBALSM NI Pirogov, Clin Cardiol, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Naydenov, Stefan Naydenov; Runev, Nikolay Margaritov; Manov, Emil Ivanov] Med Univ Sofia, Dept Internal Dis Prof St Kirkovich, 1 Georgi Sofiyski Str, Sofia 1431, Bulgaria","Naydenov, SN (corresponding author), Med Univ Sofia, Dept Internal Dis Prof St Kirkovich, 1 Georgi Sofiyski Str, Sofia 1431, Bulgaria.",,,"Naydenov, Stefan/0000-0002-0855-7861",,,,21,3,3,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,5.0,,,,,821.0,825,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_5_122,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FA9PC,WOS:000405777000016,,,,,2022-07-14

Aim of the study is to gather preliminary data on the efficacy of treatment with zinc or chromium on impairment glucose tolerance. Materials and methods: Subjects: All patients from a dietician examination had levels of blood sugar limits (35 men and 58 women; age 39-61 years). Diet food: intake of all nutrients was measured in weekly diary. The supplementation of chromium or zinc has been carried out - in a random way. Statistical analysis: Data are expressed as mean +/- SD or percentage changes from baseline. Results: Blood glucose trigger levels of our patients (especially the elderly) was closely linked to the intake of chromium with diet rather than to zinc intake. The effect of dietary supplementation of chromium based on the contribution of some foods has a beneficial effect on the glucose tolerance test (0.5 g glucose / kg body weight) (Fig. 1-A) and on the basal blood glucose levels (Fig. 1-B). In particular, the basal level of glucose in the serum decreases after 1 month of treatment, and this is still true after 6 months. Discussion: The effect of dietary chromium supplementation has a beneficial effect on the glucose tolerance test and fasting plasma glucose. The presence of zinc was less than chromium, but competes with the same chromium to the glucose tolerance test. The baseline serum glucose level decreases although it is still less than the amount detected in subjects treated with chromium. We can speculate that zinc and chromium may present a competitive effect on the absorption of insulin secretion and insulin receptor.","[Monda, Vincenzo; Monda, Giuseppe; Monda, Emanuele; Villano, Ines; Messina, Antonietta] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Expt Med, Naples, Italy; [Nigro, Ersilia] CEINGE Biotecnol Avanzate Scarl, Naples, Italy; [Ruberto, Maria] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Med Surg & Dent Specialties, Naples, Italy; Univ Foggia, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Foggia, Italy; [Valenzano, Anna; Triggiani, Antonio I.; Moscatelli, Fiorenzo] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy","Messina, A (corresponding author), Univ Naples 2, Dept Expt Med, Sect Human Physiol, Via Costantinopoli 16, I-80138 Naples, Italy.;Messina, A (corresponding author), Univ Naples 2, Clin Dietet Serv, Via Costantinopoli 16, I-80138 Naples, Italy.",,"Monda, Emanuele/AAQ-6457-2020; Triggiani, Antonio Ivano/M-6252-2015; MESSINA, ANTONIETTA/K-9366-2016; Messina, Antonietta/AHH-2383-2022; triggiani, antonio ivano/Q-4701-2019; Moscatelli, Fiorenzo/ABC-9536-2020","Monda, Emanuele/0000-0001-9304-988X; Messina, Antonietta/0000-0001-8343-432X; triggiani, antonio ivano/0000-0003-3291-9452; Moscatelli, Fiorenzo/0000-0003-1274-0332; Nigro, Ersilia/0000-0001-5637-1685; VILLANO, INES/0000-0002-1755-358X; Monda, Vincenzo/0000-0002-6083-5814",,,,47,21,21,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,581.0,585,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_085,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700006,,,,,2022-07-14

In many pathological conditions, the sport practice is strongly discouraged, as in epileptic patients for the negative consequences on their physical condition and psychic. In general, several studies reported that physical activity has positive influence on seizure frequency and severity. As a result, attitudes regarding sports and epilepsy have changed considerably in the last decades and presently, the risk of convulsive seizures during sports practice is minimal in case of well-managed epilepsy. Evaluating the control of convulsive disease is therefore a key point to allow sports in the children and adolescents.","[Monda, Vincenzo; Villano, Ines] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Sect Human Physiol, Dept Expt Med, Caserta, Italy; [Monda, Vincenzo; Villano, Ines] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Unit Dietet & Sport Med, Caserta, Italy; [Ruberto, Maria] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Med Surg & Dent Specialties, Caserta, Italy; [Valenzano, Anna] Univ Foggia, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Foggia, Italy; [Ricciardi, Annaclaudia; Romano, Palmira] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Caserta, Italy; [Ricciardi, Annaclaudia; Romano, Palmira] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Mental Hlth & Phys & Prevent Med, Caserta, Italy; [Gallai, Beatrice] Univ Perugia, Dept Surg & Biomed Sci, Perugia, Italy; [Marotta, Rosa; Lavano, Francesco; Lavano, Serena Marianna] Magna Graecia Univ Catanzaro, Dept Med & Surg Sci, Catanzaro, Italy; [Maltese, Agata] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] Univ Palermo, Dept PROSAMI, Palermo, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] CH Chinon, Childhood Psychiat Serv Neurodev Disorders, St Benoit La Foret, France; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, Palermo, Italy","Salerno, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, Palermo, Italy.",,"Marotta, Rosa/AAG-1453-2020","Marotta, Rosa/0000-0003-0515-5952; Monda, Vincenzo/0000-0002-6083-5814; VILLANO, INES/0000-0002-1755-358X; TRIPI, Gabriele/0000-0001-7088-9325",,,,98,10,10,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,,,,2.0,,1279.0,1287,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_2s_197,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV8ZY,WOS:000424877700014,,,,,2022-07-14

The Provincial Mental Hospital of Terra d'Otranto, established since 1897, started operation in 1901, under the direction of Dr. Giovanni Libertini. In 1931, after the advent of fascism, with the split of the Lecce Province into three provinces (Lecce, Brindisi and Taranto), The Mental Hospital turned into a hospital consortium, called The Interprovincial Psychiatric Hospital of Salento (OPIS) and subsequently, from 1985 to 1998, The Psychiatric Hospital Giovanni Libertini. At The Interprovincial Psychiatric Hospital of Salento (O.P.I.S.) somatic therapies, and in particular Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), were widely used. Afterwards, in the 1950s, with the advent of psychotropic drugs (neuroleptics, antidepressants, MAO inhibitors tricyclics, benzodiazepines), the success of somatic therapies and in particular of ECT decreased significantly. The recent renewed interest in somatic therapies - again considered in the most advanced scientific studies and used in a large number of renowned hospitals and universities - is linked to the considerable deepening of the biological knowledge of such therapies and to drug resistance of many psychiatric illnesses. Therefore, we considered it opportune to historically analyze the use of somatic therapies in one of the most important psychiatric institutions of Southern Italy.","[Montinari, Maria Rosa] Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, Lecce, Italy; [Minelli, Sergio] ASL Lecce, DSS 52, Lecce, Italy","Montinari, MR (corresponding author), Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, Lecce, Italy.",,"MINELLI, SERGIO/AAQ-6902-2020","MINELLI, SERGIO/0000-0002-6259-8883",,,,26,1,1,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,1051.0,1057,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_166,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500025,,,,,2022-07-14

The purpose of doing this study has been also to compare the effect of ERGH ALNASA phlebotomy with Diclofenac tablets on the pains spread to the lower limbs. Methodology: This randomized clinical trial was done in 2014-2015, patients were divided into phlebotomy and drug groups in the form of randomized allocation and without blinding, drug group was under classic treatment with Diclofenac tablets and phlebotomy group was under ERGH ALNASA phlebotomy treatment. Patients, backache was assessed by using of VAS, life quality and Roland-Morris disability questionnaires, for data analysis, Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-square, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Mann-Whiney tests were also used. Findings: 100 patients entered to phlebotomy, 49 persons were women and 51 persons were men with the age average of 43.57 +/- 11.04 years. VAS scale or the pain severity in the drug group was more than phlebotomy group meaningfully one hour (P<0.001), two weeks (P<0.001) and four weeks (P<0.001) after the start of study. Morris-Roland scale in the phlebotomy group was more than drug group meaningfully (P<0.001). The scales of physical health (P<0.001) and mental health of life quality (P<0.001) after phlebotomy in the phlebotomy group was more than drug group meaningfully. Results: Decrease in serum hemoglobulin, hematocrit, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, as well as increase in pulse rate after cesarean section was significantly more dramatic in those received lower dose of oxytocin. The need of extra medication, atony and blood transfusion requirement were observed in 18%, 5.5%, and 3.5% of those treated with low dose oxytocin. There were absecent in patients treated with.

The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of cognitive therapy in reducing glycated hemoglobin patients with diabetes. Materials and methods: The study was a quasi-experimental type and research project were the two groups of experimental group and control group, along with pre-test, post-test and follow-up. The statistical population were includes all patients with type II diabetes in the range of 25 to 45 years old age that have treated in the Ganjaviyan hospital diabetes clinic and one year of their diagnosis should past. We used an available sampling method and sample size was 40 patients and the replacement of the subjects in the intervention group and the control group was randomly. The sample of individuals was selected based on the entry-exit criteria (age 25 to 45 years old, the lack of any obvious mental disorder, the passage of one year since diagnosis of type II diabetes). Then both groups were evaluated before therapeutic intervention, in the next stage therapeutic intervention was carried out on experimental group of cognitive therapy in group method. Meetings are held weekly for 2 hours (ten sessions). The control group did not receive the therapeutic intervention in a group. So, both groups were evaluated with the use of post-test and then after three months re-evaluation was conducted as a follow-up to the amount of the effectiveness of independent variables (therapeutic intervention in a group) on the dependent variable (grades and following) will be measured. Results: The results of the Covariance analysis showed that cognitive therapy cause reduction of blood sugar (HbA1c) in the experimental group in the post-test and following stage. Conclusions: Training cognitive therapy can result in blood sugar control (HbA1c) in patients with type II diabetes. So, it is recommended that the presentation of these trainings beside other medical interventions is as a part of comprehensive treatment and care of diabetes.","[Mousavian, Narges; Mojembari, Adis Kraskian] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Psychol, Karaj Branch, Karaj, Iran; [Aghayousefi, Alireza] Payame Noor Univ, Dept Psychol, Tehran, Iran","Mojembari, AK (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Psychol, Karaj Branch, Karaj, Iran.",,,,,,,14,0,0,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,2.0,,,,,253.0,257,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_2_037,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2RK,WOS:000397230700012,,,,,2022-07-14

He often bears trouble to find its true role at this time and it is seen that finding a solution in these situations is not always easy. Because, unlike the trainings and cases indicated in nursing theories, we could state that the nurses are never ready to provide a perfect care which endow them the accountability as a professional nurse to provide nursing care for their family. Objective: The present paper aims to describe the nurses' lived experiences of attending their relatives. The study illustrates the nature of nurses' experiences at the time of taking care of their family members. Methods: This study is a phenomenology research with hermeneutics approach which was implemented to describe and understand the lived experiences of nurses in attending their relatives. The study applied a combination of purposive and snow-ball sampling methods. The participants must be the holders of bachelor's degrees or higher degree in nursing, being employed or retired and possess at least one experience of attending their family member which has been hospitalized and have the ability to express and transfer information. Eventually 11 cases (and 2 men) were selected. The information data was coded 9 women after being implemented. It was then analyzed by Dickelman analysis method. Results: One of the main themes obtained in the study was the sense of inability to practice. The two sub-themes including doubt on adequacy of action and inefficient knowledge in practice were also presented in this study. The semantic units including feelings of uncertainty on adequacy of action, inability to apply knowledge, sense of inability, sense of uncertainty, future prediction, imagination of worst positions and doubt and indecision were mentioned in relation to sub-theme of doubt on adequacy. The semantic units of difference in performance by professional and non-professional people and negative impact of practical consciousness were introduced in relation to sub-themes of inefficient knowledge in practice. Discussion: The research indicated that the nurses are not prepared for the position of attending their family member and are never trained for such situations. The nurses also possess dual role in this regard: Nursing care provider and recipient of nursing care. It should be noted that both nursing training and nurse trainee programs have been neglected in this area.","[Nasrabadi, Alireza Nikbakht; Ghiavandian, Sharzad; Sadaghiani, Safa] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Tohid St, Tehran, Iran","Sadaghiani, S (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Tohid St, Tehran, Iran.",safasadaghiani@yahoo.com,"Nasrabadi, Alireza Nikbakht/F-3768-2014; Sadaghiani, Safa/U-6922-2017","Nasrabadi, Alireza Nikbakht/0000-0002-3970-4158; Sadaghiani, Safa/0000-0001-9216-3090","Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran","The present study as a doctoral thesis entitled as lived experiences of nurses to take care of family members was scientifically and financially supported by Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran",,21,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,,,,1.0,,895.0,899,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1s_133,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV8ZR,WOS:000424877000002,,,,,2022-07-14

In the second phase, an in vivo assay was conducted to evaluate the effect of probiotic on the serum iron in rats. Results of the in vitro and in vivo assays revealed that the probiotic bacteria, significantly improved iron absorption from the mixture of phytate and iron, when compared with the control experiments. The results of this study suggest that probiotic bacteria may improve the iron bioavailability of the foods with high content of phytic acid, probably due to the phytase activity in bacteria.

The relationship between this increased risk and traditional vascular risk factors is not known exactly. The aims of this study were to investigate ischemic strokes, who had a history of cancer or diagnosed cancer during etiologic scanning, in terms of the cancer type, likely causes of stroke and demographic data. Materials and methods: In this retrospective study, the stroke patients with known cancer or diagnosed with cancer during follow-up were selected by screening the data of 1002 acute ischemic stroke patients who were followed-up in the hospital between 2012 and 2015 and demographic, clinical and imaging findings were recorded. Temporal association between cancer type, presence of metastasis, treatment administered, response to therapy, cancer and stroke, possible stroke etiology and stroke risk factors of the patients were investigated. Results: An association was determined between acute ischemic stroke and cancer in 58 (5.8%) of our patients. Sixty-nine percent of our patients were males and the mean age was 66.5-year. Cancers most commonly found were lung (20.7%), colorectal (15.5%) and prostate cancer (13.8%). The most frequently found risk factors for ischemic stroke were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Twelve point one percent of the patients did not have any traditional risk factors for ischemic stroke. Eight point six percent of the patients had ischemic stroke as a presenting symptom of cancer. Sixty-eight point nine percent of the patients had supratentorial infarcts and 10.3% of them infratentorial infarcts. Supratentorial infarcts were most commonly located in the middle cerebral region, and infratentorial infarcts were located in the brainstem. Conclusion: Cancer patients with ischemic stroke showed different risk factors, stroke etiology and infarct localizations. Therefore, cancers need to be particularly studied in patients who do not have traditional risk factors for ischemic stroke.","[Ocek, Levent] Usak Univ, Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Neurol, Fevzi Cakmak Mahallesi,Denizli Caddesi 4, Usak, Turkey; [Sener, Ufuk; Ilgezdi, Irem; Ozcelik, Metin Murat; Zorlu, Yasar] Tepecik Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Neurol, Izmir, Turkey","Ocek, L (corresponding author), Usak Univ, Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Neurol, Fevzi Cakmak Mahallesi,Denizli Caddesi 4, Usak, Turkey.",,,,,,,24,5,5,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,601.0,606,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_089,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700010,,,,,2022-07-14

On the other hand, there is no difference between the incidence of mental disorders in children with PMNE and controls, although the psychological genesis could provide additional secondary forms, in which the child might react to stressful events with the resumption of involuntary urination at night, with a possible alteration of bowel control due to a high vulnerability to stressors. The purpose of this study is assessing the stressful events of life in a sample of children with PMNE. Materials and methods: 56 subjects with PMNE, (37 males and 19 females) (mean 10.87 years; SD +/- 1.68) were recruited consecutively. All subjects were evaluated for the presence of stressful events (ICU) with test Coddington Life Events Scales (CLES). The control group consists of 98 typically developing children (65 males, 33 females) (p = 0.855) (mean 11.3 years; SD +/- 1.85; p = 0.594). Results: Individuals with enuresis do not show a significant difference in the prevalence of stressful events than the control group (42.85% vs 41.83%; Chi-square = 0.002; p = 0,963) (table 1). Conclusions: These results for the first time show that PMNE can be regarded as an independent state by stress factors, suggesting that it itself represents a stress factor that can affect the proper psychological and neuropsychological development in children.","[Parisi, Lucia; Maltese, Agata; Di Folco, Annabella; Di Filippo, Teresa; Roccella, Michele] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Faraldo, Maria Antonietta] Univ Naples 2, Dept Mental Hlth & Phys & Prevent Med, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Naples, Italy; [Ruberto, Maria] Univ Naples 2, Dept Med Surg & Dent Specialties, Naples, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Messina, Giovanni] Univ Foggia, Dept Expt Med, Sect Human Physiol, Foggia, Italy; [Messina, Giovanni] Univ Foggia, Unit Dietet & Sports Med, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Foggia, Italy","Roccella, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",,,,,,,50,15,15,0,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,1.0,,,,,23.0,27,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1_003,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2PY,WOS:000397226800003,,,,,2022-07-14

The areas concerned are mainly those related to social communication, social interaction and mutual functional and symbolic play. In the last decades, different conceptions of autism have taken, also emphasizing different sensory-perceptual abnormalities as the basis of the central features of disorder. This pilot study intends to address the issue of sensory perception in preschool children affected by ASD. Material and methods: 11 ASD children were enrolled (7 males, 4 female) aged between 2.3 years and 4.6 years, (mean age 3.29 +/- 0.72). The control group consisted of 24 typical developing children (15 males, 9 females) (mean age 3.08 +/- 0.87). All subjects underwent assessment of sensory perceptual abilities according to the Bogdashina's Sensory Profile Checklist Revised (SPCR) evaluation (43). Results: The two groups are comparable for age (p = 0.491) and sex distribution (p = 0.755). Table 1 shows the comparison between the two groups results in the SPCR, specifically, individuals with ASD, showed significantly higher scores on near all perception areas evaluated than healthy controls, suggesting a clear perceptual impairment in ASD subjects. Only for olfactory perception two groups were comparable. Conclusions: no significant differences in behavioral reaction to smell stimulation between ASD and typical developing children, and this result could be explained according to the early age of our sample that could cause high reactivity to smell stimulation also in typical developing examined children.","[Parisi, Lucia; Maltese, Agata; Di Folco, Annabella; Di Filippo, Teresa; Roccella, Michele] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Fortunato, Maria Rosaria] Univ Naples 2, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Dept Mental Hlth & Phys & Prevent Med, Naples, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, I-90133 Palermo, Italy","Roccella, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",,,,,,,50,16,16,0,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,1.0,,,,,49.0,53,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1_007,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2PY,WOS:000397226800007,,,,,2022-07-14

Work-family conflict (WFC) results from the incompatibility between family demands and business/workplace needs. WFC can impact parental quality with many consequences on children health. Aim of study is assessing the prevalence of sleep disturbances in enuretic children, sons of work-shifters. Materials and methods: 80 children (67 males) aged 5-13 years (mean 10,43; SD +/- 1,99), were consecutively referred for PMNE. Sleep habits were investigated with Sleep Disturbances Scale for Children (SDSC) and the results were compared with a control group of 255 (190 males) typical developing children (TDC) sons of no shift-workers, matched for age (mean 10.57 SD +/- 1,89; p = 0.569) and sex distribution (Chi-square= 2.416; p = 0.120). Results: To evaluate statically differences among mean values of two samples, the Chi-square test was performed. Logistic regression was assessed to verify the role of paternal shift-working as risk factor for sleep disorders. p <= 0.05. All sleep disturbances categories were more prevalent in PMNE children sons of shift-workers than control group (Chi-square= 43.926; p<0.001); particularly 82.5% of PMNE vs. 11.76% of TDC show pathological scores for SBD category (Chi-square = 145.592; p<0.001; OR = 35,35; IC95% = 17.71-70.57); 61.25% vs 9.41% for SWTD (Chi-square = 93; p <0.001; OR = 15.213; IC95% = 8.21-28.15); 57.5% vs 9.41% for DA (Chi-square = 82.31; p < 0.001; OR = 13.02; IC95% = 7.06-23.98); 37.5% vs 6.67% for DIMS (Chi-square = 45.476; p < 0.001; OR = 8,4; IC95% = 4.3-16.39); 26.25% vs 5.88% for SHY (Chi-square = 24.257; p < 0.001; OR = 5.69; IC95% = 2,76-11,71) and 25%c vs 5.49% for DOES (Chi-square = 23.323; p < 0.001; OR = 5,73; IC95% = 2,73-12,01).

In all neurodevelopmental disorders, we can observe autonomic alteration comprising sleep disorders, meal behaviour alteration and self-regulatory impairment. These alterations/impairment are very frequent in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (1-12). Aim of the present preliminary study is the assessment of metabolic rate in children affected by ASD. Material s and methods: 5 males affected by ASD aged 7-10 years (mean age 6.73 +/- 3:39), were recruited. The average score at the ADOS scale was 12.24 (SD +/- 3.29). The control group consisted of 5 males typically developing children (TDC) aged 7 to 11 years (mean age 7.92 +/- 3.23). Autonomic/Metabolic evaluation: Free-living daily physical activity was measured using either the SenseWear Armband in order to calculate the total energy expenditure (TEE), baseline (REE) and the metabolic physical activity for prolonged periods of time. In general, the SenseWear Armband allows objective monitoring of the lifestyle including duration and sleep efficiency. Results: ASD subjects show values of total energy expenditure (p = 0.0047) and active energy expenditure (p = 0.044) significantly higher compared to control subjects (Table 1). In addition, ASD children have a metabolic intermediate significantly higher than healthy subjects (p=0.015). (Table 1). Finally, the ASD children show a significant reduction of sleep time (p = 0.027) (Table 1). Conclusion: ASD can represents a very significant risk factor for developing sleep disorders and to high energy expenditure, although further studies are needed in this respect.","[Parisi, Lucia; Maltese, Agata; Di Folco, Annabella; Di Filippo, Teresa; Roccella, Michele] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, Palermo, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] Univ Palermo, Dept PROSAMI, Palermo, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] CH Chinon, Childhood Psychiat Serv Neurodev Disorders, St Benoit La Foret, France; [Romano, Palmira] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Mental Hlth & Phys & Prevent Med, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Caserta, Italy","Roccella, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy.",,,"TRIPI, Gabriele/0000-0001-7088-9325",,,,48,11,11,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,3.0,,,,,491.0,494,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_3_073,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EV3BF,WOS:000401631200021,,,,,2022-07-14

Anxiety can be differentiated in state anxiety and trait anxiety. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a disorder most commonly caused by a triplet repeat expansion of >200 cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeats in the 50 untranslated region of the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Aim of the present study is investigating the state or trait anxiety in a sample of mothers of children affected by X-fragile. Materials and methods: 84 mothers (mean age 48.36 +/- 7.11) of children affected by FXS were recruited and compared with mother of 171 typical developing children (mean age 46.18 +/- 9.53). The Scale State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI) was used in order to assess the anxiety levels. Results: All mothers of children affected by FXS showed high score of anxiety levels at the STAI evaluation (Table 1), with no differences were found between mothers of males and females children affected. Conclusions: Mothers of children with FXS appear to be in a state of anxiety effects and suddenly even higher than those found later in mothers of children with other chronic diseases.","[Parisi, Lucia; Maltese, Agata; Di Folco, Annabella; Di Filippo, Teresa; Roccella, Michele] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, Palermo, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] Univ Palermo, Dept PROSAMI, Palermo, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] CH Chinon, Childhood Psychiat Serv Neurodev Disorders, St Benoit La Foret, France; [Romano, Palmira] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Mental Hlth & Phys & Prevent Med, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Caserta, Italy","Roccella, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy.",,,"TRIPI, Gabriele/0000-0001-7088-9325",,,,48,15,15,1,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,3.0,,,,,495.0,499,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_3_074,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EV3BF,WOS:000401631200022,,,,,2022-07-14

The present study was performed to investigate the biochemical mechanism of wound healing activity of this plant in rats. After creating full-thickness skin wounds on the back of the rats, they were randomly divided into three groups. Two groups as the treated and positive control received the extract of EA and mupirocin ointment, respectively and other group as the control group, was not subjected to any treatments. Isolated tissues from wounds were harvested for 5, 10, and 15 days and were then underwent biochemical analysis. Healing activity was assessed by the rate of wound contraction and collagen content. The in vivo antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity was investigated to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. The concentration levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were determined in wound tissues by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a real-time RT-PCR. The results indicated a significant increase in the percentage of wound contraction and collagen content in the treated group, when compared with the control and positive control groups. Both mRNA and protein levels of the TNF-alpha were significantly reduced in the EA treated group. A significant decrease was also observed in Malondialdehyde and Myeloperoxidase content in the treated group compared to the control group. This study revealed that the EA extract accelerates cutaneous wound healing. This effect may confer its antioxidant and anti inflammatory activities. Therefore, EA extract may be useful in the current management of wound healing. ns.","[Pasalar, Parvin] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Fac Med, Keshavarz Blvd, Tehran, Iran","Pasalar, P (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Fac Med, Keshavarz Blvd, Tehran, Iran.",ppasalar@yahoo.com,"Dehpour, Ahmad Reza/I-6422-2019; Mehrabani Natanzi, Mahboobeh/O-3489-2017; Khodaii, Zohreh/S-4983-2017","Dehpour, Ahmad Reza/0000-0002-8001-5565; Kamalinejad, Mohammad/0000-0002-5946-4913; Mehrabani Natanzi, Mahboobeh/0000-0001-8879-5984; Tavangar, Seyed Mohammad/0000-0002-4253-2385; Khodaii, Zohreh/0000-0002-8858-1983",Tehran University of Medical Sciences [89-01-30-10456],The present study was financially supported by the Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Grant No. 89-01-30-10456).,,36,0,1,3,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,2.0,,,,,305.0,311,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_2_046,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2RK,WOS:000397230700021,,,,,2022-07-14

In this study patients who were undergoing PD were screened for RLS and analyzed for associated factors. Material and methods: The study group was consisting of 69 PD patients and 43 healty controls. Beck Depression Inventory was used to analyse for the presence of depression. Sleep disorders were assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Results: Demographic characteristics of patients and the control group were similar. The rate of RLS tended to be higher in the PD group (p=0.075). There was no difference between PD and control groups in insomnia severity. Logistic regression analysis revealed the only factor independently associated with RLS to be a higher ISI score (p=0.008). Logistic regression analysis revealed the only factor independently associated with at least sub-threshold insomnia as a higher depression score (p=0.002). Being in the PD group and presence of RLS also tended to be independently associated with at least sub-threshold insomnia (p=0.051 and p=0.099, respectively). Linear regression analysis revealed the presence of RLS and a higher depression score as factors independently associated with a higher ISI score (p=0.002 and p=0.013, respectively). Conclusion: The rate of RLS tended to be more common in patients under PD treatment. The main risk factor for the presence of RLS was insomnia.

Identification and effective treatment of TB patients in the community are important to control TB. In our country, the task of ensuring TB control was given to Tuberculosis Control Dispensaries (TCD). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the applications made to TCD Southwestern Turkey between the years of 2010-2014. Materials and methods: The target population of the descriptive and retrospective study where TB surveillance data was analyzed was constituted by 394 people who applied to Tuberculosis Control Dispensary in the Southwest region of Turkey between the years of 2010 and 2014. Results: 66.2% of the applicants were male, 37.3% were in the 40-59 age group, 68.7% were married and 9.5% did not have any social insurance. Considering the reasons of application, 93.6% of the subjects applied personally and 6.4% applied with the contact history. New patients formed 78.0% of the cases, while 15.1% of the applicants were the ones who were transferred, 5.1% had recurrent disease, 1.0% were those who returned from discontinuation of the therapy and 0.8% were the patients who applied due to treatment failure. According to the records, 0.3% of the applicants were diagnosed with HIV, 9.6% used alcohol and 20.8% smoked. 66.9% of the patients had pulmonary involvement and 44.9% had contact with at least one person. Sputum examinations were performed in 65.0% of the applicants and 55.1% were determined to be positive. 71.8% of the patients were determined to have radiological findings compatible with the disease. 45.9% of the patients were found positive as a result of the bacteriological smear. Treatments of 35.0% of the registered patients were started in TCD and the length of treatment period lasted 0-6 months. According to the results of treatment, 70.5% of the patients completed the treatment and 3.6% died. All patients were implemented directly observed treatment. Conclusion: Dominant male gender among those who apply to TCD, being in 40-59 age group, applications due to personal reasons, new cases, pulmonary involvements, performing of sputum examinations, positive results, implementing the treatment in a hospital and completion of treatments are the most important results of the study. In conclusion, the first-line tuberculosis control takes an important place in the tuberculosis control in our country.

The control group consists of 114 children with typical development (68 males and 46 females), aged between 3 and 10 years (mean 5.91 +/- 2.23 years). The diagnosis of ASD was confirmed by the evaluation ADOS -2, while the evaluation of sleep habits with the SDSC tests. Results: The two groups were matched for age (p = 0.633) and sex distribution (p = 0.483). The ASD subjects show a significantly higher rate of sleep disorders in all categories explored by SDSC tests (Table 1). Discussion: The sleep of people with ASD is compromised at any age and regardless of the severity of social impairment and communication, but not the level of development. Still, ASD is a very important risk factor for the development of sleep disorders, although the report could also be interpreted in the opposite manner.","[Precenzano, Francesco; Verde, Domenico; Romano, Palmira] Univ Naples 2, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Naples, Italy; [Precenzano, Francesco; Verde, Domenico; Romano, Palmira] Univ Naples 2, Dept Mental Hlth & Phys & Prevent Med, Headache Ctr Children & Adolescents, Naples, Italy; [Ruberto, Maria] Univ Naples 2, Dept Med Surg & Dent Specialties, Naples, Italy; [Parisi, Lucia; Maltese, Agata; Di Folco, Annabella; Di Filippo, Teresa; Roccella, Michele] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, Palermo, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] Univ Palermo, Dept PROSAMI, Palermo, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] CH Chinon, Childhood Psychiat Serv Neurodev Disorders, Chinon, France; [Messina, Giovanni] Univ Foggia, Dept Expt Med, Sect Human Physiol, Foggia, Italy; [Messina, Giovanni] Univ Foggia, Unit Dietet & Sports Med, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Foggia, Italy","Roccella, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy.",,,"TRIPI, Gabriele/0000-0001-7088-9325",,,,47,33,33,3,26,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,3.0,,,,,405.0,409,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_3_059,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EV3BF,WOS:000401631200007,,,,,2022-07-14

Campylobacteriosis is endemic in developing countries. Present study is aimed to indicate the prevalence of Campylobacter species in adult patients in East Azerbaijan province of Iran using PCR and culture methods. Material and methods: 1020 stool samples (498 men and 522 women) were collected and examined from adult patients in East Azerbaijan province, Iran during June-December 2016 year. Samples obtained with inflammatory criteria like fecal leukocytes (WBC >= 5) had been selected and isolated through fecal lactoferrin detection test. The samples with WBC >= 5 and lactoferrin positive samples were selected for Campylobacter detection by culture and PCR methods. Some necessary information like age, sex, place of habituation, living with animals were asked and recorded. Results: Campylobacter species were obtained from 79 (35.4%) samples out of 223 by multiplex PCR which consisted of 55 C. jejuni (24.7 %), 17 C. coli (7.6 %) and 7 mixed infection with both species (3.1 %). The significant correlations were seen between the prevalence of Campylobacter and patients who lived in rural places with animals or who had a daily contact with poultry. Conclusion: Investigation of Campylobacter jejuni prevalence in Northwest of Iran showed this bacterium can be one of the most important pathogens in inflammatory diarrheal cases. The observed risk factors for Campylobacter diarrhea were poor sanitary monitoring and the presence of animals in habituation places.","[Ranjbar, Reza] Baqiyatallah Univ Med Sci, Mol Biol Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Babazadeh, Daryoush] Islamic Azad Univ, Tabriz Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Tabriz, Iran; [Jonaidi-Jafari, Nematollah] Baqiyatallah Univ Med Sci, Hlth Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran","Babazadeh, D (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Tabriz Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Tabriz, Iran.",Daryoushbabazadeh@gmail.com,"Babazadeh, Daryoush/H-8472-2019","Babazadeh, Daryoush/0000-0003-1118-2295","Molecular Biology Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Dey laboratory; Imam Reza Hospital; Tabriz Children's Hospital; Central Laboratory of East Azerbaijan","Present study is sponsored by Molecular Biology Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, but the authors thankful to the Dey laboratory, Imam Reza Hospital, Tabriz Children's Hospital and Central Laboratory of East Azerbaijan for their support and supplying the instruments, samples and devices.

We hypothesized in the Hatha Yoga practitioners, reduced anxiety and a better tone of mood, superior performances in attentional tasks and, finally, more efficient attentive functions. Materials and methods: The research sample includes 26 women, of whom 13 (average age 39.07 years +/- 10.53 SD) practice Hatha Yoga (Yoga group) and 13 (average age 39.23 years +/- 13.45 SD) do not practicing any sport activities (Nsport group). The following psychological assessment tests were used: Profile of Mood States (POMS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y (STAI-Y) and Attention And Concentration Test (ACT). Results: Yoga group shows better control of internal tension states. None significant differences between the Yoga group and the Nsport group was observed by evaluating the anxiety, although in the Nsport group, State anxiety is associated with a lower sense of perceived energy, while in the Yoga group the State anxiety is related to a decrease of Depression. The Trait anxiety in Nsport group is associated with feelings of tension, fatigue, depression and aggression, with a consequent decrease in mood, whereas in the Yoga group none relationship between Trait anxiety and mood states was detected. Finally, concerning the sense of perceived energy, only the Yoga group showing performance improvement in the Attention and Concentration test. Conclusion. The practice of Hatha Yoga can be seen as a factor that can prevent and improve the quality of people's life, and although its effectiveness in treatment is still under investigation, it could be understood as a valid helper of classical treatments.","[Rinella, Sergio; Romeo, Rossella; Massimino, Simona] Univ Catania, Sect Physiol, Dept Biomed & Biotechnol Sci, Catania, Italy; [Di Corrado, Donatella] Kore Univ, Dept Human & Social Sci, Sch Sport Sci, Enna, Italy","Massimino, S (corresponding author), Univ Catania, Sect Physiol, Dept Biomed & Biotechnol Sci, Catania, Italy.",,"Di Corrado, Donatella/K-3757-2019; Rinella, Sergio/ADM-1130-2022; Di Corrado, Donatella/H-3726-2019; Rinella, Sergio/AAB-5946-2021","Rinella, Sergio/0000-0002-9368-7088; Di Corrado, Donatella/0000-0001-8223-6671; ",,,,39,0,0,1,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,1067.0,1072,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_169,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500028,,,,,2022-07-14

A vast educational pressure as well as social and economic changes is among those tensions which have influenced all people working in medical professions. To cope with these conditions, psychological factors including personality, social maturity, emotional maturity, anxiety and self-esteem are very effective. Methods: This study is descriptive-analytics. 113 students studied in the field of Midwifery and paramedics in the School of Nursing participanted in this study. They completed some questionnaires such as Cattell's Sixteen Factors Personality Inventory, Rao's social maturity scale, Singh and Bhargava's emotional maturity scale, Hamilton's Anxiety Rating Scale, Coopersmith's self-esteem scale and demographicinformation. Results: 22 male students (19.5%) and 91 female students (80.5%) participated in this study. 104 participants (92%) were single and 9 participants (8%) were married. The average age of participants was 20.92 years. 16 nursing students (14.2%), 35 evening students of nursing (31%), 15 students of by stop course of nursing (13.3%), 15 bachelor students of anesthesia (13.3%), 15 Operating Room student (13.3%), 17 students of health technology (15%) participated in the study. 40 participants (35.4%) were studying in the second semester and 73 participants (64.6%) were studying in the third semester. The following findings were achieved in this study: There is a significant reverse relationship between the traits of A and B of Cattell'spersonality and anxiety and between the trait of N and social maturity. There was a significant direct relationship between the trait of C and social and emotional maturity and self-esteem and also between the trait of G and self-esteem. There was a significant direct relationship between the trait of O and emotional maturity while this relationship is in reverse between the trait of O and social maturity and self-esteem. There was a significant reverse relationship between the trait of Q3 and emotional maturity while there was a significant direct relationship between the trait of Q3 and social maturity and self-esteem. The trait of Q4 had direct relationship with emotional maturity while it had a significant reverse relationship with social maturity and self-esteem. Discussion: This study showed that there was a reverse relationship between the Reserved/Warm and personal anxiety and between concrete thinking/abstract thinking and anxiety. There was also a relatively strong reverse correlation between emotional stability - reactiveness and emotional maturity. There was a direct correlation emotional stability - reactiveness and social maturity and between expedient/rule-conscious and self-esteem. Private/Forthrightand social maturity had a significant reverse correlation with each other. Self-Assured/Apprehensivehada direct relationship with emotional maturity while these traits had a reverse relationship with social maturity and self-esteem. The trait of Tolerates Disorder had a direct relationship with self-esteem. Based on our findings, it can be concluded that social maturity and high self-esteem reduce stress.","[Sadaghiani, Safa] Tehran Univ Med Sci & Hlth Serv, Nursing, Tehran, Iran; [Jamhiry, Reza] Hormozgan Univ Med Sci, Nursing & Midwifery Sch, Dept Nursing, Bandar Abbas, Iran; [Azad, Mohsen] Hormozgan Univ Med Sci, Paramed Sch, Dept Biostat, Bandar Abbas, Iran; [Mahmoodi, Hamid] Hormozgan Univ Med Sci, Paramed Sch, Dept Languages, Bandar Abbas, Iran; [Imani, Elham] Hormozgan Univ Med Sci, Nursing & Midwifery Sch, Dept Nursing, Nursing, Bandar Abbas, Iran; [Nokar, Royaheidari] Hormozgan Univ Med Sci, Bandar Abbas Hlth Ctr, Social Pathol Majoring Prevent Addict, Bandar Abbas, Iran","Jamhiry, R (corresponding author), Hormozgan Univ Med Sci, Nursing & Midwifery Sch, Dept Nursing, Bandar Abbas, Iran.",rezajamhiry@gmail.com,"Mahmoodi, Hamid/AAH-4003-2021; imani, elham/J-7020-2017; Mahmoodi, Hamid/L-9638-2017; Sadaghiani, Safa/U-6922-2017","Mahmoodi, Hamid/0000-0002-4138-0463; imani, elham/0000-0003-3957-3343; Mahmoodi, Hamid/0000-0001-7567-653X; Azad, Mohsen/0000-0001-5843-1338; Sadaghiani, Safa/0000-0001-9216-3090",Department of Science and Technology of Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences and Health Services,"The study is conducted by the financial support of the Department of Science and Technology of Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences and Health Services.

Material and methods: Forty Sprague Dawley rats were divided into five groups. Group1 underwent only a right nephrectomy. Group 2 was administrated vinpocetine after right nephrectomy. Group 3 initially underwent a right nephrectomy. Them, left kidney of this group was applied ischemia for 60 minutes, which was followed by reperfusion for 24 hours. Group 4 underwent same steps as group 3; but was administrated vinpocetine 10 mg/kg i.p. before I/R to the left kidney. Similarly, group 5 underwent same steps as group 3 but was administrated vinpocetine 10 mg/kg i.p. after I/R to the left kidney. Results: Plasma BUN and creatinine showed no significant differences between control ( Sham) group and groups that were administrated vinpocetine. Decrease in plasma urea and creatinine was detected group 5, but this finding was not present in group 4. Superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase levels in groups 4 and 5 were significantly higher than the group 3. Parallel to this, oxidative stress index was higher in the group 3compared to groups 2, 4, and 5 (p<0.05). No significant difference was found between levels of malondialdehite in sham and vinpocetine administrated only group (p<0.005). All groups showed no differences in catalase levels and Total Antioxidant Capacity. Decreased tubular injury was present in the groups administrated vinpocetine before and after I/R. In control and vinpocetine given groups, there were some apoptosis in tubules after tested with caspase 3. Caspase 3 positivity was significantly higher in I/R group compared to control group. Vinpocetine if given after I/R was more effective to prevent apoptosis then to be administrated before I/R. Conclusion: This experimental study showed that vinpocetine promotes achieving better renal functions.

Methods: Patients referred to the Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation outpatient clinic due to musculoskeletal system pain were divided into two groups according to the Brighton diagnostic criteria as BJHS and non-BJHS. The demographic characteristics of the patients in both groups, clinical findings with physical examination, anamnesis, physical examination, myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) or fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) presence, pain severity with visual pain scale (VAS), Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), and depression status assessed by the Beck Depression Index (BDI) were recorded. Results: The number of painful involvement sites was significantly higher in the BJHS group than in the control group (p< 0.000). The VAS during exercise and at rest were statistically significantly higher in the BJHS group (p< 0.000). The incidence of MPS (p< 0.000) and FMS (p=0.040) was statistically higher in the BJHS group. No statistically significant difference was found in the BDI between the groups (p=0.179). In terms of function status assessment, the BJHS group had statistically significantly lower subparameters of Short Form-36, including pain, overall health, energy, and social activities, than the control group (p=0.011, p=0.001, p=0.027, and p=0.043, respectively). Conclusions: Subjects with BJHS had more overlapping clinical features such as FMS and MPS with more severe and diffuse pain when compared to non-BJHS subjects.

Combinations of antibiotics acting by different mechanisms are used for the treatment of MDR bacterial infections. In this study we evaluated the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of colistin (CO), doripenem (DOR), tigecycline (TIG) alone and in vitro synergistic activity of CODOR, CO-TIG and DOR-TIG combinations against MDR A. baumannii strains isolated from patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Materials and methods: Thirty A. baumannii strains isolated from various clinical specimens of patients in ICUs were included in the study. The epsilometer test (E-test) method was used for determining the synergistic activity of different antibiotic combinations. Synergistic, additive, indifferent and antagonist effects of A. baumannii strains were evaluated by Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (FIC) index. Results: Of the 30 MDR A. baumannii strains tested, 90% were susceptible to TIG, 93.3% to CO and 50% to DOR. CO-DOR, CO-TIG and DOR-TIG combinations were found to have synergistic or additive effects against 3 (9.9%), 5 (16.6%) and 4 strains (13.3%), respectively. The synergistic or additive effect of DOR-TIG combination was 19.9% for DOR resistant strains and 6.6% for DOR susceptible strains. The synergistic or additive effect of CO-DOR combination was 19.9% for DOR resistant strains and 0% for DOR susceptible strains. Conclusion: Among the tested antimicrobial combinations, the combination of CO with TIG was most effective against MDR A. baumannii strains isolated from patients in ICUs. The synergistic or additive effects both for CO-DOR and DOR-TIG combinations were higher in DOR resistant strains. This study suggested that combination therapy with DOR for treating MDR A. baumannii infections should be used especially in DOR resistant strains.","[Sanal, Laser] YuksekIhtisas Training & Res Hosp, Microbiol Lab, TR-06420 Ankara, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Neziha] Bozok Univ, Microbiol Dept, Yozgat, Turkey; [Sen, Suha] Yuksek Ihtisas Training & Res Hosp, Infect Dis Dept, Ankara, Turkey; [Cesur, Salih] Ankara Numune Training & Res Hosp, Infect Dis Dept, Ankara, Turkey","Sanal, L (corresponding author), YuksekIhtisas Training & Res Hosp, Microbiol Lab, TR-06420 Ankara, Turkey.",,"yılmaz, neziha/AAH-3524-2020",,Yuksek Ihtisas Training and Research Hospital [322-1],"This study was presented as a poster presentation in the 7th Eurasia Congress of Infectious Diseases between 30 September and 3 October 2015 in Tbilisi, Georgia and 30th National Congress of Antibiotic and Chemotherapy at 6-10 May 2015 in TRNC (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus) and was supported by a grant from Yuksek Ihtisas Training and Research Hospital, Project no: 322-1.",,25,3,3,1,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,691.0,697,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_103,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700024,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: Twenty-one male Wistar rats were divided in three groups. Group I was chosen as control, Group II subcutaneously injected every other day with CCl4 for 1 month, whereas rats in Group III were received daily.-3 fatty acids via intragastric gavage while exposed to CCl4 for 1 month. Finally, all animals were killed by decapitation and blood samples were taken. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total and conjugated bilirubin levels were measured. Additionally, hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were determined. For histopathological evaluation, the liver samples from experimental and control groups were processed for light microscopy. Results: All serum biochemical parameters and the hepatic MDA content were significantly higher in animals treated with CCl4 than in the controls, while SOD and GSH-Px values were significantly decreased in these animals. Moreover, administration of CCl4 alone caused histopathologically prominent damage in the liver compared to the control group. Daily.-3 fatty acids treatment significantly reduced serum biochemical parameters and hepatic MDA levels. These fatty acids also reduced serum SOD and GSH-Px activities in rats received CCl4 plus.-3 fatty acids. Furthermore, the histopathological changes induced by CCl4 were attenuated with administration of.-3 fatty acids. Conclusion: These findings suggested that.-3 fatty acids are involved in protecting liver against CCl4 toxicity.","[Saygili, Omur Karaca; Gulcen, Burak; Ozcan, Emrah] Balikesir Univ, Fac Med, Dept Anat, Balikesir TR-10145, Turkey; [Paksoy, Serpil] Balikesir Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pathol, Balikesir TR-10145, Turkey; [Hismiogullari, Sahver Ege] Balikesir Univ, Fac Vet Med, Dept Pharm & Toxicol, Balikesir TR-10145, Turkey; [Kus, Murat Abdulkadir] Univ Mehmet Akif Ersoy, Hlth Coll, Burdur TR-15000, Turkey; [Sunay, Fatma Bahar] Univ Balikesir, Fac Med, Dept Histol & Embryol, Balikesir TR-10145, Turkey","Saygili, OK (corresponding author), Balikesir Univ, Fac Med, Dept Anat, Balikesir TR-10145, Turkey.",,"SUNAY, FATMA BAHAR/AAG-5912-2019","SUNAY, FATMA BAHAR/0000-0002-2231-7979",,,,32,4,4,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,1.0,,,,,137.0,143,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1_021,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2PY,WOS:000397226800021,,,,,2022-07-14

Such position is widely discussed and three among the most accepted criteria were submitted to comparison. Materials and methods: 55 subjects devoid of any evident motor dysfunction were receiving the test in the three selected feet positions configurations: Joined Parallel [JP], 30 degrees degrees with 5 cm heels apart [30 degrees], Parallel Apart [PA] at about 15 cm distance from each other. Six sequences have been selected and applied in a random way to the subjects in order to avoid learning effects or fatigue bias in the test results. Results: The data have demonstrated that: 1) The Romberg quotients (the ratio between homologous parameters calculated in the Closed Eyes Test vs. the Open Eyes Test), although affected by the feet position, keep their standard meaning independently by the feet position; 2) A significantly greater variability of Sway Parameters is afforded by the Joined Parallel Feet [JP] while the Parallel Apart Feet position [PA] seems to afford the lowest sensitivity in quantifying balance performances; 3) The [30 degrees] test seems to be the most comfortable one and therefore likely to be the most convenient for unstable or dysfunctional subjects that cannot keep the [JP] position; 4) The [PA] and the [30 degrees] test are showing very similar results. Conclusion: We can therefore conclude that the first choice for feet positioning to perform balance tests on force platform should be towards the Joined Parallel Feet, the others, however, might represent a valid choice for impaired patients.","[Scoppa, Fabio] Sapienza Univ Rome, Fac Med & Dent Surg, Masters Degree Course Posturol, Rome, Italy; [Scoppa, Fabio; Belloni, Gabriele] Chinesis IFOP, Osteopathy Sch, Rome, Italy; [Gallamini, Michele] Univ Palermo, Sport & Exercise Sci Res Unit, Palermo, Italy; [Messina, Giuseppe] Univ Palermo, Sport & Exercise Sci Res Unit, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy","Scoppa, F (corresponding author), Via Giovanni Pascoli 6, I-90144 Palermo, Italy.",,"Messina, Giuseppe/N-7298-2019","Messina, Giuseppe/0000-0003-2774-4950; Gallamini, Michele/0000-0002-4550-526X",,,,29,24,25,0,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,707.0,713,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_105,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700026,,,,,2022-07-14

And also we aimed to compare the outcomes of multidisciplinary, 8 weeks, outpatient PR programme in young elderly and old elderly patients with COPD. Methods: Patients underwent multidisciplinary PR in a hospital outpatient programme twice weekly for 8 weeks. Dyspnea, incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) distance, endurance time (ET) health status with SGRQ, anxiety and depression scores and body compositions were assessed before and after PR. Results: Subjects were divided in two groups: group A (young elderly) (n = 33, mean age 62.39 +/- 5.66 years) and group B (old elderly) (n = 16, mean age 77.34 +/- 2.52 years). ISWT distance increased significantly (P < 0.001) by a median 40 m in group A and 65 m in group B. There were significant improvements in HAD (Hospital Anxiety Depression) scores within the young and old elderly groups. Conclusions: With PR; except for the improvement in exercise capacity, old elderly patients with COPD improved dyspnea, health related quality of life, anxiety and depression as much as the young elderly ones. PR should be integrated to the treatment of symptomatic patients who is 75 years and older with decreased exercise capacity, daily activities and quality of life as an effective approach. Age should not be an exclusion criteria for comprehensive outpatient PR programmes. Out patient PR is an effective treatment strategy for old elderly patients with COPD.","[Selcuk, Nursel Turkoglu] Antalya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Pulm Med, Antalya, Turkey","Selcuk, NT (corresponding author), Antalya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Pulm Med, Antalya, Turkey.",,,,,,,24,3,3,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,2.0,,,,,321.0,327,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_2_048,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2RK,WOS:000397230700023,,,,,2022-07-14

The EUCAST standard has been used in Turkey since 2015. The aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in antibiotic susceptibilities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) isolates using local data during the transition process from the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standards to EUCAST. Materials and methods: In total, 105 non-duplicate clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were analyzed. Conventional methods and the Vitek-2 automated system (bioMerieux, France) were used to identify the isolates. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed with the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. In addition to the routinely used discs, ceftazidime 10 mu g and piperacillin/tazobactam 30/6 g were added to create different contents for both of the standards. The antibiotic susceptibility zone diameters of the isolates were evaluated in accordance with the CLSI 2014 and EUCAST 2014 standards, and a difference in the ratio of resistance levels was found. Results: It was observed that antibiotics with different disc contents had different resistance ratios according to the evaluation made with each of the standards. The resistance ratio of ceftazidime (10 mu g to 30 mu g) and piperacillin/tazobactam (100/10 mu g to 30/6 mu g) in P. aeruginosa increased from 1.9% and 0.95% to 4.8% and 15.2%, respectively, when we compared the CLSI 2014 with the EUCAST 2014 standards. There were no significant differences in the susceptibility results for imipenem, meropenem, amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and cefepime. Conclusion: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is one of the most important tasks in clinical microbiology laboratories. Upon the implementation of the EUCAST guidelines, laboratories should be aware of the implications of modified drug susceptibility testing reports on antibiotic prescription policies. Additionally, the continuity of local surveillance activities should be ensured.","[Sezgin, Fikriye Milletli] Ahi Evran Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Microbiol, TR-40100 Kirsehir, Turkey; [Alagoz, Gorkem Aytac] Ahi Evran Univ, Training & Res Hosp, Microbiol Lab, Kirsehir, Turkey","Sezgin, FM (corresponding author), Ahi Evran Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Microbiol, TR-40100 Kirsehir, Turkey.",,,,,,,21,0,0,1,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,2.0,,,,,285.0,290,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_2_042,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2RK,WOS:000397230700017,,,,,2022-07-14

Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) deficiency is the most common inherited lipid metabolism disorder resulting in recurrent myoglobinuria. CPT II deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive trait and clinical phenotype varies from severe and multisystemic infantile form to mild muscle form characterized by rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria. Exercise, infections, starvation, and cold exposure are the most important factors triggering rhabdomyolysis in cases with CPT II deficiency. The severity of disease episodes is considerably variable and some patients may develop acute renal failure during the episodes. Case presentation: The current manuscript presents a patient with acute uremia, who suffered from nausea, vomiting, and dark-colored urination in the past three days. The patient was initially considered to have acute renal failure (ARF) associated with dehydration. However, high levels of creatine phosphokinase suggested the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. Remarkable medical history for prolonged starvation and cold exposure and past medical history that was remarkable for a single episode of dark-colored urination in adolescence prompted genetic analysis, which revealed carnitine palmitoyltransferase II(CPT II) deficiency. The current report presents a patient with acute renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis that was associated with CPT II deficiency and it highlights the importance of anamnesis in diagnosis and treatment. Conclusion: Inherited disorders are one of the rare but important causes of rhabdomyolysis. These inherited causes are often overlooked. The present manuscript has attempted to highlight these issues.","[Sivtritepe, Ridvan; Basat, Sema Ucak; Tatar, Kevser Kutlu] Univ Hlth Sci, Umraniye Educ & Res Hosp, Internal Med, Elmalikent Quarter, AdemYavuz St 1, Umraniye Istanbul, Turkey; [Tugcu, Murat] Haydarpasa Numune Educ & Res Hosp Nephrol, Tibbiye St 2334668, Istanbul, Turkey","Sivtritepe, R (corresponding author), Univ Hlth Sci, Umraniye Educ & Res Hosp, Elmalikent Quarter, AdemYavuz St 1, Umraniye Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Tugcu, Murat/AAN-3585-2021","Sivritepe, Ridvan/0000-0003-0547-1883",,,,13,1,1,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,5.0,,,,,789.0,793,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_5_116,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FA9PC,WOS:000405777000010,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients that presented to Eskisehir Government Hospital, Eskisehir Yunus Emre Government Hospital, and Sakarya Private Hospital for routine follow-up between June-October-2015. 6-item Morisky scale was applied to each subject. The Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to compare the groups that were not distributed normally, when the number of groups was three or more. The Pearson's Chi-Square, Yate's Chi-Square and Pearson's Exact Chi-Square tests were used for the analyses of cross tables. Results: The main finding of the study is that the values of HbA1c, triglyceride, HDL and LDL were significantly better and the rate of achieving target HbA1c and HDL values was significantly higher in the group of patients with high motivation and knowledge according to the Morisky scale. Backward stepwise analysis indicated that level of education was a factor that affects motivation, and that illiteracy was associated with low motivation (Odd's ratio: 3.02 CI: 1.51-6.04, p=0.002). Exercise habit and level of education were the factors that have an impact on high/low knowledge. The risk of low knowledge was higher in participants with no exercise habits (Odd's ratio: 2.91, CI: 1.34-6.33, p=0.007). The risk of low knowledge was also higher in illiterate participants (Odd's ratio: 3.25, CI: 1.30-8.86, p=0.021). Conclusion: More attention should be paid to illiterate female patients, in order to ensure their adherence to treatment. To this end, there is a need to cooperate with educational institutions, and to offer easily accessible reading and writing instruction and training on diabetes and to encourage such patients to get trained.","[Son, Nazan Erenoglu] Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Fac Med, Afyon, Turkey; [Taskiran, Bengur] Eskisehir Yunus Emre Govt Hosp, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, Eskisehir, Turkey; [Yorulmaz, Goknur] Eskisehir Osmangazi Univ, Fac Med, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, Eskisehir, Turkey; [Son, Osman] Acibadem Private Hosp, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, Eskisehir, Turkey; [Kokoglu, Burcu; Bilge, Ugur] Eskisehir Osmangazi Univ, Fac Med, Dept Family Med, Eskisehir, Turkey; [Bilgin, Muzaffer] Eskisehir Osmangazi Univ, Fac Med, Dept Biostat, Eskisehir, Turkey","Bilge, U (corresponding author), Eskisehir Osmangazi Univ, Fac Med, Dept Family Med, Eskisehir, Turkey.",,"Taşkıran, Bengür/AAA-3574-2020; Bilgin, Muzaffer/AAG-3041-2020","Taşkıran, Bengür/0000-0003-4842-450X; Bilgin, Muzaffer/0000-0002-6072-6466",,,,22,2,2,0,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,921.0,928,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_146,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500005,,,,,2022-07-14

Therefore, the purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of 8-week aerobic exercise program on Cholesterol, Blood Lipids and cigarette withdrawal behavior of Smokers. Methods: A quasi experimental with pre and posttest design were conducted in this study. 24 male smokers with mean age of 22.3 +/- 3.2 participated in this study. Blood-lipids, cholesterol profile and withdrawal behavior of subjects was tested before and after intervention. Results: The results suggested that exercise intervention not only improved the cigarette withdrawal behavior in depressed smokers, but also decreased LDL, TG and cholesterol (p <= 0.05) while HDL was not influenced by exercise intervention (p= 0.05). Conclusion: Conclusively, it was revealed that smokers can benefit from aerobic exercise. The exercise may increase the oxygen supply to the brain, and cause a better mood and mitigate the negative consequences of smoking and probably it can be the main reason for improving withdrawal symptoms of smoking. The positive effects of exercise on cholesterol and other lipids may be justified, by regulating the metabolism of all lipids in the blood. It must be noted that further research needed to understand the mechanisms involved in improved lipid profiles and withdrawal symptoms, such as stress reduction or neurobiological mechanisms.","[Taheri, Morteza; Irandoust, Khadijeh; Bagherpour, Fatemeh] Imam Khomeini Int Univ, Qazvin, Iran; [Noorian, Fahimeh] Shahidd Chamran Univ Ahvaz, Sport Sci, Ahvaz, Iran","Taheri, M (corresponding author), Imam Khomeini Int Univ, Qazvin, Iran.",taheri_morteza@yahoo.com,"Taheri, Morteza/N-5170-2016; irandoust, khadijeh/ABH-3519-2021","Taheri, Morteza/0000-0001-8031-3792; ",,,,15,3,3,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,597.0,600,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_088,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700009,,,,,2022-07-14

According to the results, it can be concluded that the probability for occult knee joint fracture with ACL injury was 92% (1200/1300), the probability for occult knee lateral compartment fracture with ACL injury was 85% (1100/1300). Regarding the fracture type such as lateral femoral condyle fracture, tibia lateral frontal fracture, and lateral tibial plateau posterior fracture, the probabilities for them with ACL injuries were 80% (800/1000), 67% (600/900), and 89% (400/450), respectively. In addition, lateral tibial plateau posterior fracture, lateral femoral condyle fracture, and occult fracture of the anterior intercondylar area were all observed in combination with ACL injury. Analysis of the data showed that knee joint occult fracture was the indirect embodiment of ACL injury, with a strong association between the two. However, lateral tibial plateau posterior fracture, lateral femoral condyle kissing contusion and occult fracture of the anterior intercondylar area were not as associated with ACL injury.","[Tang, Wenjun; Qin, Weibin] Tongling Univ, Dept Phys Educ, Tongling 244061, Peoples R China","Tang, WJ (corresponding author), Tongling Univ, Dept Phys Educ, Wuhu 244061, Peoples R China.",40830024@qq.com,,,Key research project of Humanities and Social Sciences in Anhui Province [SK2016A092],Key research project of Humanities and Social Sciences in Anhui Province in 2016 (No. SK2016A092).,,15,0,0,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,,,,3.0,,1321.0,1324,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_3s_205,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AC,WOS:000424878100007,,,,,2022-07-14

However, combining these lifestyle modifications may be more effective than either intervention alone. Therefore, We examined the effects of 8 weeks High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) with and without garlic supplement on some lipid profiles in obese inactive women. Method: The study used a 3-experimental group, pretest and posttest design with 40 obese women of mean age 35.9 +/- 1.7 years (BMI, more than 30) whom were purposefully selected and randomly divided into three experimental groups and control group. The first experimental group followed a 8-week training program on 3 days/week; the second one underwent on the same training program with garlic supplement intake simultaneously; the third group has just garlic supplement and a control group with no training and supplement. before taking primary and final blood samples, the 24-hour diet recall questionnaire was used to control the subject's diet the day before taking blood samples. Total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides were assessed by the enzymatic colorimetric method on an Architect C8000 system using the respective reagent kits. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald formula. Results: Improved lipid profiles were detected in the HIIT exercise and garlic complement in obese inactive women (p=0.05). The results indicated that garlic supplementation and exercise training improved all lipid profiles including TG, HDL, LDL, Chol/HDL and VLDL, while the combination of HIIT and garlic supplement may have more significant effect on lipid profiles (p=0.05). Conclusion: HIIT exercise and garlic complement improves the lipid profiles such including LDL, HDL, Cholesterol and Triglyceride in obese inactive women.

Red blood cell distribution width, neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio, platelet / lymphocyte ratio values and leukocyte levels of the patients in the study group have been observed significantly higher than the control group (p <0.05). The parameter with the highest sensitivity and specificity was found as NLR. Conclusion: The highest sensitivity and specificity parameter is neutrofil-leukocyte ratio. We suggest that neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio aids in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis since neutrofil-leukocyte ratio is cheap, ease of use and rapid assessment method.","[Temizi, Ayetullah; Ozdemir, Yilmaz; Aslan, Adem; Atasoy, Gussen; Albayrak, Yavuz] Erzurum Area Training & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, TR-25100 Erzurum, Turkey; [Bostanci, Mustafa Taner; Caparlar, Mehmet Ali] Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Area Training & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Ankara, Turkey","Temizi, A (corresponding author), Erzurum Area Training & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, TR-25100 Erzurum, Turkey.",,"bostancı, mustafa taner/AAD-6014-2022; aslan, adem/AAI-4239-2020","aslan, adem/0000-0002-9083-9306",,,,33,5,5,1,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,3.0,,,,,411.0,416,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_3_060,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EV3BF,WOS:000401631200008,,,,,2022-07-14

We aimed to explore the toxicological effects of RMP. Materials and methods: The dose-dependent perturbations in urinary metabolite concentrations caused by RMP toxicity were investigated using 1H NMR spectroscopy coupled with multivariate statistical analysis. Wistar rats were investigated by exposing to RMP at different dosages. Urine samples were collected during toxic insult and regenerative phase and analyzed by NMR, ICP-MS and multivariate data analysis. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of 1H NMR from rat urine revealed a dose-dependent metabolic shift between the vehicle-treated control rats and rats treated with RMP. Results: Compared with control group, the administration of high dosed RMP led to elevation of urinary carnitine, cysteine, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, tyrosine, alpha-hydroxy-n-valerate and 4-aminohippurate accompanied by level decreases in urinary creatinine, glucose, histidine, lactate and urocanate in 1 day post-dose. After 15 days following the administration of high dosed RMP, the higher concentration of creatinine, cysteine, glucose, asparagine, allantoin, isoleucine and glutamate and the lower concentrations of histidine, tyrosine, tryptophan and urocanate were observed. Conclusion: The toxicity involves the perturbation of energy metabolism, amino acids metabolism and purine metabolism in high dosed group, while changes in another two dosed groups were less significant. An immediate As-related toxicity was also observed in high dosed group. Hg and Pb may be responsible for the inhibition of the recovery since they could not excrete easily from urine. This work illustrated the high reliability of NMR-based metabonomic approach on the study of the biochemical effects induced by traditional Tibetan medicine.","[Tian, Guihua; Wang, Zhiyong; He, Xin] Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Tian, Guihua] Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Dongzhimen Hosp, Beijing 100700, Peoples R China; [Rezeng, Caidan] Qinghai Univ, Med Coll, Res Ctr Chinese & Tibetan Med, Xining 810001, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhongfeng] Capital Normal Univ, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China","He, X (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Li, ZF (corresponding author), Capital Normal Univ, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.",1961787430@qq.com; nmrlab@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [81573832, 81403468]; Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation [7122015]; Program for Excellent Talents of Beijing City [2010D005016000002]; Beijing Nova Program [XX2013032, XX2014B049]","We are grateful to all of the subjects who kindly agreed to participate in this study.

In literature, the reports about the patients with multiple primary malignancies are being published with increasing frequency. Case presentation: A 58 year-old female patient was diagnosed as left breast cancer, staged as pT1N0M0, in June 2002. In July 2010 basal cell skin cancer (pT1N0M0) on the skin of epigastric region, in January 2013 right breast cancer (pT1bN0M0), in February 2014 lung squamous cell carcinoma in upper lobe of left lung (pT2N0M0) and bladder invasive urothelial carcinoma (pT2bN0M0) developed in that patient. It was proven pathologically that all of these tumors are primary tumors, not metastasis from another one. Conclusion: There is no consensus in the treatment of patients with multiple primary malignancies. Our patient was treated for each tumor according to its own stage with multimodality approach. She is now 72 year-old, currently in complete clinical and radiological remission and she continues follow-up visits.","[Tokluoglu, Saadet] Ankara Guven Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Ankara, Turkey; [Aydin, Oguz Ugur] Ankara Guven Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Ankara, Turkey; [Ulas, Arife] Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Ankara Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Ankara, Turkey; [Durnali, Ayse GoeK] Ankara Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Ankara, Turkey","Tokluoglu, S (corresponding author), Ankara Guven Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Ankara, Turkey.",saadettoklu@yahoo.com,"Durnalı, Ayşe/ABC-2229-2021; Durnalı, Ayşe/AAZ-8847-2021",,,,,20,2,2,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,1.0,,,,,145.0,149,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1_022,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2PY,WOS:000397226800022,,,,,2022-07-14

We determined the antibiotic susceptibilities and genetic resistance mechanisms of 135 A. baumannii isolates from Giresun State Hospital, Turkey between January 2013 and September 2014. Material and methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standarts Institute guidelines. beta-lactamase coding genes were investigated by simplex/multiplex PCR. Results: High rates of multi drug resistance (51.11%) and extensively drug-resistance (48.14%) were remarkable. Colistin was seemed to be the only active compound against all clinical strains. Isolates were found 100% positive for bla(OXA-51) and 95.55% positive for bla(OXA-23). Of all the isolates, 97.05% were found to be blaTEM (n=131) positive concomitant with whether bla(OXA-51) or bla(OXA23) or both them. All strains were negative for the rest of the beta-lactamase coding genes. ISAb1 element was positive in the 98.51% (n=133) of the isolates and 100% of them were located upstream of bla(OXA-51/23). Conclusion: To our knowledge this study revealed the highest co-existence of bla(OXA-51/23) and also demonstrated the increase of co-existence of both bla(OXA-51/23) and ISAba1/bla(OXA-51/23) over time in Turkey.

These diseases are characterized by significant vascular damage and prolonged wound healing process. HBO has been recently shown to mobilize stem/progenitor cells from the bone marrow. Because of its potential to promote neovascularization it is believed that HBO contributes to vascular damage recovery. In this study we questioned whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy might exert pro-angiogenic effects via the modulation of endothelial progenitor cells. Methods: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 15 healthy human volunteers (5 women and 10 men; mean age: 49.4 +/- 2.56 years; body weight: 70.3 +/- 4.58 kg; height: 1.67 +/- 4.19 m) before and after exposure to hyperbaric oxygen (n= 8) for 20 days (90 min at 2.4 ATA once a day) and exposure to hyperbaric compressed air (n= 7), for 90 minutes at 2.4 ATA twice per day for 20 days. Flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis was performed on these samples to identify and enumerate endothelial progenitor cells. Results: Our results show a significant effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on surface markers of endothelial progenitor cells in healthy volunteers. The number of CD34/CD133-expressing cells increased in volunteers after both the 1st (p < 0.02) and the 10th HBO exposures (p < 0.05). HBO group shows also significant increase of CD34/CD133/VEGFR-2 -expressing cells only at 1st treatment (p < 0.05), compared to basal values, returning to normal values at wash out. Conclusion: HBO might induce modulation of endothelial progenitor cells biology and this mechanism could initiate clinical benefits exerted by neoangiogenesis and neovascularization.","[Vezzani, Giuliano; Rizzato, Alex; Quartesan, Silvia; Bosco, Gerardo] Univ Padua, Dept Biomed Sci, Hyperbar Med & Physiol Lab, Padua, Italy; [Iezzi, Manuela] Univ G DAnnunzio, CESI MeT, Dept Med & Aging Sci, Chieti, Italy; [Mangar, Devanand; Camporesi, Enrico M.] Tampa Gen Hosp, TEAMHlth Res Inst, TGH, Anesthesia, Tampa, FL USA; [Paganini, Matteo] Azienda Osped Univ Padova, Emergency Med Residency Program, Dept Med, Padua, Italy; [Vezzani, Giuliano; Rizzato, Alex; Quartesan, Silvia; Bosco, Gerardo] Univ Padua, Dept Biomed Sci, Physiol Lab, Via Marzolo 3, I-35132 Padua, Italy","Paganini, M (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Biomed Sci, Physiol Lab, Via Marzolo 3, I-35132 Padua, Italy.",,"Iezzi, Manuela/AAB-7939-2019; Paganini, Matteo/K-9258-2019","Iezzi, Manuela/0000-0002-6296-6498; Paganini, Matteo/0000-0002-7556-6928; BOSCO, GERARDO/0000-0001-6595-7944",,,,17,6,6,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,5.0,,,,,801.0,805,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_5_118,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FA9PC,WOS:000405777000012,,,,,2022-07-14

Platelets precursors megakaryocytes are shown to contribute to bone formation with osteoblasts. It was indicated that vitamin D, which also played an important role in bone remodeling, had receptors in many tissues as well as receptors in platelets, and these receptors decreased in osteoporosis. In this study we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the mean platelet volume (MPV), which shows platelets and platelet functions, and bone mineral density (BMD) and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in postmenopausal women. Material and methods: Three hundred sixty two postmenopausal women were included in this study. Their demographics, laboratory values and BMD were recorded. The subjects were divided into three groups as control, osteopenia and osteoporosis according to the results of BMD. MPV and platelet counts were investigated in these groups. Also correlation tests were performed to evaluate the relationship between platelet functions, vitamin D and BMD measurements. Results: There was no difference in MPV and platelet counts between groups. No significant correlation was determined between MPV and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. However, based on the findings of our study, we established that there was a significant correlation between the platelet count and lumbar spine (L1-4) T score. Conclusion: This study showed that there was no relationship between MPV and osteoporosis. MPV might be considered a less important indicator in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and osteoporosis.","[Vural, Meltem; Mert, Meral] Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Training Hosp, Istanbul, Turkey; [Erhan, Belgin; Gunduz, Berrin; Keles, Betul Yavuz; Erdem, Abdullah Eslem; Bozan, Ahmet] Istanbul Phys Med Rehabil Training Hosp, Istanbul, Turkey; [Arslan, Hulya] Yozgat Publ Hosp, Yozgat, Turkey","Vural, M (corresponding author), Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Training Hosp, Istanbul, Turkey.",,,,,,,33,5,5,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,3.0,,,,,443.0,448,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_3_065,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EV3BF,WOS:000401631200013,,,,,2022-07-14

This study aimed to investigate the role of self-management in the blood glucose control of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and explore the relationship of self-management with risk factors of chronic complications of T2DM. Materials and methods: a survey was conducted in 900 DM patients in the Huamu Community Health Center in Shanghai in Deptember 2014, and the individual background, past medical history, self-management of DM were collected. Moreover, these patients received physical examination and laboratory examination. Results: excise and medication in self-management were negatively related to glycated hemoglobin (P<0.05), special diet and excise in self-management were negatively associated with systolic blood pressure (P<0.05), and general diet and excise in selfmanagement were negatively related to urinary microalbumin to creatinine ratio (P<0.05). The self-management has no relationship with total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterin. Logistic regression analysis showed good excise (OR 0.929, 95% CI 0.877-0.983) and medication (OR 0.932, 95% CI 0.886-0.981) in self-management were helpful for the normalization of blood glucose, and good excise was able to reduce the risk for microalbuminuria (OR 0.918, 95% CI 0.861-0.979). Conclusion: the effective self-management of DM desires to be generalized in clinical practice. To improve the self-management in T2DM patients is helpful to control blood glucose and blood pressure and delay the microalbuminuria progression.","[Wang, Yakun] Huamu Community Hlth Ctr Shanghai Pudong New Area, Shanghai 201204, Peoples R China; [Fang, Ningyuan] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Renji Hosp, Dept Geriatr, Shanghai 200127, Peoples R China","Fang, NY (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Renji Hosp, Dept Geriatr, Shanghai 200127, Peoples R China.",,,,Outstanding Young Medical Talent Project of Health System in Shanghai Pudong New Area [PWRq2014-25],This study was supported by Outstanding Young Medical Talent Project of Health System in Shanghai Pudong New Area (PWRq2014-25).,,14,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,5.0,,,,,751.0,756,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_5_110,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FA9PC,WOS:000405777000004,,,,,2022-07-14

The study group was injected with magnetic alprostadil lipid microsphere via the opposite femoral artery, while the control group injected with physiological saline, and the blank group was treated with no vessel blockage or medication after skin flap preparation. At different time points of ischemia and reperfusion of the skin flaps, the blood flow volume and the content of MDA and NO in the flap tissues were determined by a laser Doppler Flowmetry, thiobarbituric acid method, and nitrate reductase method, respectively. At 7h after suture in situ of the skin flaps, the designed area and survived area of the skin flaps were determined by coordinate decal method, based on which, the survival rate of the skin flaps was calculated. Meanwhile, routine histopathologic slides of the flap tissues were taken for immunohistochemical staining to identify the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Results: The study group had significantly higher micro-circulation volume, NO synthesis quantity, VEGF expression density, and 7-d survival rate and significantly lower MDS level of the skin flaps than the control group and blank group. Conclusion: As a high-performance bioactive compound, alprostadil can improve the micro-circulation and lighten the ischemia-reperfusion injury by increasing NO content and protecting the vascular endothelium of skin flaps.","[Wang, Yanjin; Chen, Zhenyu; Ren, Jizhen] Qingdao Univ, Dept Plast Surg, Affiliated Hosp, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Yiqing] Qingdao Univ, Peoples Hosp 1, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Qing Econ & Technol Dev Area, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Lei, Cheng Gang] Qingdao Univ, Dept Hepatobiliary Surg, Qingdao Municipal Hosp, Qingdao, Peoples R China","Chen, ZY (corresponding author), Qingdao Univ, Dept Plast Surg, Affiliated Hosp, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,1123.0,1128,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_176,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500035,,,,,2022-07-14

The purpose of the controlled trial was to compare the clinical outcomes of the two groups. Statistical analysis of the differences in clinical treatment outcome between the two groups was performed with Chi-square and t tests. Results: showed that there were varying degrees of improvement in various clinical indicators after the treatment. Clinical symptom improvement, improvement in nerve conduction velocity, and the overall treatment effectiveness in the experimental group patients treated with L-carnitine combined with hemodialysis were significantly superior to those of the control group patients treated simply with hemodialysis. Differences between the groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05).

We previously indicated that miR-222 promotes non-small cell lung cancer growth. Here, we aimed to investigate whether the miR-222 expression level was associated with clinic pathological factors and prognostic values of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The expression level of miR-222 in the pathological tissues and paired normal tissues of NSCLC was evaluated using a quantitative real-time RT-PCR. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was demonstrated following a log-rank test. Results showed that miR-222 expression level is up-regulated in NSCLC tissues compared with matched normal tissues (mean +/- SD: 3.55 +/- 1.71vs. 2.08 +/- 1.01, P < 0.001). The high expression of miR-222 in NSCLC cancer tissues was also remarkably related with aggressive clinic pathological features. The expression level of miR-222 was associated with tumor grade (P= 0.031) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0028). Moreover, the results of Kaplan-Meier analyses indicated that patients with high expression level of microRNA-222 had shorter overall survival and progression free survival (P < 0.001). The multivariate analysis clearly indicated that the high miR-222 expression in biopsy samples might be a useful independent biomarker for NSCLC prognosis (RR 3.23; 95% CI, 2.12-5.47). Our data demonstrated that the aberrant expression of microRNA-222 is associated with NSCLC progression and it might be a potential biomarker for NSCLC prognosis.","[Xu, Yi-Ming] Nantong Univ, Dept Thorac & Cardiovasc Surg, Affiliated Hosp, Nantong 226001, Peoples R China; [Liu, Wei] Nantong Univ, Dept Thorac Surg, Haian Peoples Hosp, Nantong 226600, Peoples R China","Zhong, CJ (corresponding author), Nantong Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Thorac & Cardiovasc Surg, 6 Haierxiang Bei Rd, Nantong 226001, Peoples R China.",,"ravegnini, gloria/K-1330-2016; Jeong, Yongwook/N-7413-2016","ravegnini, gloria/0000-0002-7774-402X; ",Science and Technology Support Program of Nantong City [MS22015083],"Thanks Doctor Liang Shen (The Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University) for clinical tissue samples and information collection.

Increasing evidence suggests that microRNAs, a novel class of non-coding RNAs that function as endogenous suppressors of gene expression, are deregulated in non-small cell lung cancer. Although microRNA-222 overexpression has been described in NSCLC, the role of miR-222 and its target genes in erlotinib resistant PC-9 (PC-9/ER) cells remain poorly elucidated. Here we established miR-222 overexpression and low expression models by transfection with miR-222 mimic, inhibitor or their negative controls. Cell proliferation was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and EdU incorporation assay. MiR-222 and its putative target gene p27 expression level were determined using qRT-PCR and/or Western blot. MiR-222 overexpression induced an enhancement of PC-9/ER proliferation in vitro. P27 expression was negatively regulated by miR-222 overexpression at post-transcriptional level in PC-9/ER cells. Transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) for p27 increased PC-9/ER cell proliferation rate, validating that p27 is a target gene of miR-222 during PC-9/ER cell proliferation. This study suggests that miR-222 may regulate the acquired resistance of PC-9/ER cells to erlotinib by down-regulating p27. Inhibition of miR-222 might be a novel therapeutic strategy for TKI-resistant NSCLC.","[Xu, Yi-Ming; Ding, Sheng-Guang; Shen, Liang; Huang, Hai-Tao; Zohng, Chong-Jun] Nantong Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Thorac & Cardiovasc Surg, 6 Haierxiang Bei Rd, Nantong 226001, Peoples R China","Zohng, CJ (corresponding author), Nantong Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Thorac & Cardiovasc Surg, 6 Haierxiang Bei Rd, Nantong 226001, Peoples R China.",,,,Science and Technology Support Program of Nantong City [MS22015083]; Youth Fund Project of Nantong Health Bureau [WQ2016044],This work was supported by the grants from Science and Technology Support Program of Nantong City (No: MS22015083 to Y.

Factor XIII plays an important role in the stabilization of the linkage between fibrins. Three different genetic structure of Valine34Leucine polymorphism in FXIIIA have been described. Valine/Valine structure has been identified as the homozygous normal (wild-type), whereas Valine/Leucine and Leucine/Leucine structures have been identified as heterozygous and homozygous mutants respectively. Genetic polymorphisms in FXIII-A subunit vary substantially from society to society. The primary objective of this study was to determine the relationship between factor XIII polymorphisms and arterial/venous thromboembolism in the southeast of Turkey. Methods: A total of 127 patients with arterial and venous thrombosis were included as the study group and 102 healthy subjects with no thromboembolic disorders were included as the control group. Val34Leu polymorphism in FXIII was investigated in both groups using PCR (Polymerase chain reaction). Results: The prevalence of the polymorphism in the study and control groups were compared with chi-square test, no statistically significant differences were found (the prevalence in the study and control group are 68.5% and 66.7% for V/V allele, 29.2% and 29.4% for V/L allele, and 2.4% and 3.9% in L/L allele respectively, with p = 0.787). When deep vein thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed female patients group (n = 8) was compared to the healthy female control group, V/L allele was significantly lower, whereas L/L allele was significantly higher (p = < 0.01). Conclusions: This study indicates that there is no evidence for association between factor XIII-A Val34Leu polymorphism and arterial/venous thromboembolism. The significant result we found for the DVT patients should be strengthened by further studies with greater number of cases. In future, further studies are needed with more specific groups and with greater numbers of patients.","[Yildirim, Mehmet Serdar; Oto, Ferhat; Goruk, Mucahit; Akdogan, Mehmet Recai; Nas, Necib] Dicle Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Diyarbakir, Turkey; [Dal, Mehmet Sinan; Karakus, Abdullah; Ayyildiz, Orhan] Dicle Univ, Fac Med, Dept Hematol, TR-21280 Diyarbakir, Turkey","Dal, MS (corresponding author), Dicle Univ, Fac Med, Dept Hematol, TR-21280 Diyarbakir, Turkey.",,,,,,,25,2,2,1,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,1.0,,,,,83.0,87,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1_013,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2PY,WOS:000397226800013,,,,,2022-07-14

Its incidence, 5 years after treatment, is 0.03-0.2%. This risk is related to radiation dose, concomitant alkylating agents and genetic factors. Case presentation: We report the case of a 33-year-old woman with synchronous gastric (adenocarcinoma, intestinal type, T3N2M0, Stage 3A) and right-sided breast cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), T2N1M0, Cerb2 (+++), Stage 2B) who received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) and radiotherapy (RT) to stomach and breast. At the 22nd month after RT, pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma was diagnosed at the right thoracic wall including axillary region (field of RT) synchronously with the left sided breast cancer. After adjuvant CT, first she received chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) for gastric cancer. After that she received complex RT to breast region (right supraclavicular fossa single front plan, tangential fields bolus), a total of 5000 cGy as 200 cGy/day X 25 fractions to right chest wall and a total dose as 5000 cGy to posterior axillary region. During follow-up, a 3 cm lesion at right axilla and a BIRADS 4A lesion in her left breast were determined. Sarcoma in right axilla and IDC in left breast were reported after biopsy. Patient underwent surgery at the same session. Conclusion: Although post-radiation sarcomas are rare complications with poor prognosis, enhanced awareness and early detection by clinicians are essential to improve outcomes via curative surgical resection. Latent period is expressed with years, but in our case RIS was developed after a short time with 22 months.","[Yildirim, Nilgun] Dr Ersin Arslan Training & Res Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Gaziantep, Turkey; [Simsek, Melih; Turkeli, Mehmet; Bilici, Mehmet] Ataturk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Oncol, Erzurum, Turkey; [Ozmen, Hilal Kiziltunc] Ataturk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Radiat Oncol, Erzurum, Turkey","Yildirim, N (corresponding author), Dr Ersin Arslan Training & Res Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Gaziantep, Turkey.",,"yıldırım, Nilgün/W-1484-2018; Kiziltunc Ozmen, Hilal/AAZ-7566-2021; Kiziltunc Ozmen, Hilal/AAZ-8355-2021","Kiziltunc Ozmen, Hilal/0000-0003-0695-0931; ",,,,18,3,3,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,565.0,568,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_082,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700003,,,,,2022-07-14

The management of cancer-related dyspnea remains a challenge due to lacking systematic guidelines for clinical care. The mainstay of cancer related dyspnea palliation is being considered altering central perception, and morphine is still the first choice of therapy. Conventional management of cancer related dyspnea might not be suitable for emergency department. Palliative treatment of a cancer patient shouldn't always be planned as end of live care in the ED. There has been no study published that describes the efficacy of bronchodilators or respiratory muscle relaxants inpatients experiencing dyspnea with lung cancer. The aim of the study was to determine effect of salbutamol, beta 2 agonist and magnesium sulfate, respiratory muscle relaxants for improvement on respiratory capacity in patients with lung cancer. Methods: This was a randomized, double blind clinical trial. Adult patients with lung cancer, with a Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) of <250 L/min, who did not receive bronchodilators and not requiring assisted ventilation were included. Patients were randomized to receive either serial three doses of 2.5 mg salbutamol plus 1500 mg magnesium sulfate in IV 100 mL 0.9% NaCl or serial three doses of 2.5 mg salbutamol plus 100 mL IV 0.9% NaCl. We defined the primary outcome measures as the changes in PEFR and Fischl index over time (at 0 and 120 min). Results: Salbutamol therapy increased mean PEFR from 127.4 liters/minute to 169.4 liters/minute (p<0.01), while salbutamol plus magnesium therapy increased it from 131.1 to 174.9 liters/minute (p<0.01). Both therapies resulted in improvement in Fischl Scores. After treatment PEFR and Fischl Scores were similar between the two groups (p=0.74, p=0.19). Conclusion: Optimal management of dyspnea in cancer patients requires an understanding of the causes and decision-making process must consider of the patient's general condition, the presence and severity of symptoms. The results of this study revealed, salbutamol, a non-opioid, beta 2-agonist agent, provided significant improvement on respiratory capacity in patients with cancer related dyspnea.

The aim of this study was to determine prevalence of prehypertension and its association with neck and abdominal obesity in disease-free young adults. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in an urban public university of Turkey. The anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were obtained from 704 healthy disease-free young adults. Comparisons among blood pressure groups were done with the Chi-square test. Multivariate regression analysis was carried out to determine risk factors for prehypertension. The Pearson correlation was employed to determine correlation between the prehypertension and anthropometric measurements. P<0.05 values were considered as statistically significant. Results: The overall prevalence of prehypertension was 49.0%, 53.1% in males and 44.9% in females. Prevalence of prehypertension was significantly higher in males comparison to females (p<0.001). The overall prevalence of neck obesity, abdominal obesity and overweight/obesity was 18.2%, 6.1% and 23.0% respectively.

Even though the relationship between different phenotypes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bone mineral density was not fully understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate bone mineral density in different phenotypes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and compare these outcomes with an age-correlated control group. Methods: In this retrospective study 100 patients (emphysematous, chronic bronchitis and healthy control group) were participated. Participants underwent DXA absorptiometry to evaluate bone mineral density. Spirometric pulmonary function tests, 6-minute walk test, bode index, and modified medical research council dyspnea score, body mass index and levels of calcium, vitamin D and parathormone were also evaluated. Comparative assessment of the findings was performed and statistical analysis was applied in present study. Results: Patients with the emphysematous phenotype had significantly lower femur bone mineral density (P = 0.05), body mass index (P < 0.05), than chronic bronchitis phenotype. Inverse correlations were revealed between lumbar bone mineral density and modified medical research council dyspnea score. Statistical analysis was performed by the multivariate logistic regression analysis model test and Tukey tests (p < 0.05). On ANOVA analysis, the emphysematous group have two fold higher risk of osteoporosis and lower bone mineral density detected than other groups(OR 1.947, 95% CI (1.009-3.792), P = 0.081; OR, 1.863,95% CI (1.027-3.274), P = 0.037).

Methods: Rats were randomly divided into six groups: saline control group (control), bleomycin group (BLM), bleomycin added astragaloside at 20 mg/kg.bw (BLM+AS20), bleomycin added astragaloside at 40 mg/kg.bw (BLM+AS40), bleomycin added astragaloside at 60 mg/kg.bw (BLM+AS60), bleomycin added dexamethasone (DE). On Day 3, 7, 14 and 28, eight rats in each group were respectively sacrificed to collect lung samples for further analysis. The activity of PLA2, hydroxyproline content and the content of PGE2, LTC4, TGF-beta 1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured on different days. HE-staining and optical microscopy were performed to examine the pathological changes in lungs. Results: The activity of PLA2, hydroxyproline content and PGE2, LTC4, TGF-beta 1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were obviously increased for BLM group compared to the control group. Compared with the BLM group, AS treatment groups significantly alleviated all the above negative changes exited in the BLM group in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the pathological injury was also gradually improved by AS treatment compared with the BLM rats, which was similar to the dexamethasone group. Conclusion: Our study suggested a therapeutic potential of AS in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.","[Yu, Wei-Na; Sun, Li-Feng; Yang, Hua] Yantai Hosp Tradit Chinese Med, Dept Respirat, 39 Xingfu Rd, Zhifu 264000, Yantai, Peoples R China","Yang, H (corresponding author), Yantai Hosp Tradit Chinese Med, Dept Respirat, 39 Xingfu Rd, Zhifu 264000, Yantai, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,36,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,1151.0,1156,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500039,,,,,2022-07-14

The clinical features, diagnotic dilemmas and management strategies of this rare condition have not been sufficiently elucidated. Materials and methods: A comprehensive literature collection resulted in 58 pertinent articles with 62 patients, which constitute the study material of this research. Results: Fever in this patient setting during hospitalization was 38.8 +/- 0.7 (range, 37.4-40; median, 38.9)degrees C. The duration of fever was 6.4 +/- 14.6 months. The time interval from the onset to the diagnosis of cardiac myxoma was 6.0 +/- 6.1 months, and from physician consultation to the diagnosis was 1.4 +/- 2.6 months. Poor responses to antimicrobial therapies were observed in at least 35% of the patients, and 4.9% were otherwise managed. Surgical resection of cardiac myxoma was performed in 48 (88.9%). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed an overall survival rate of 87.0% with a survival of 95.5% in surgical and 16.7% in nonsurgical groups. Conclusion: Patients with cardiac myxoma presenting with fever of unknown origin pose challenges due to the nonspecific clinical manifestation. Elevated circulating levels of the inflammatory biomarkers including C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 are helpful in differential diagnosis between cardiac myxoma with FUO and infected cardiac myxoma. An early diagnosis of cardiac myxoma with FUO relies on a timely echocardiographic investigation. Due to its poor response to antibiotic therapy and immediate subside of fever following cardiac myxoma resection, a prompt surgical treatment is recommended up diagnosis is made.","[Yuan, Shi-Min] Fujian Med Univ, Teaching Hosp, Hosp Putian 1, Dept Cardiothorac Surg, 389 Longdejing St, Putian 351100, Fujian, Peoples R China","Yuan, SM (corresponding author), Fujian Med Univ, Teaching Hosp, Hosp Putian 1, Dept Cardiothorac Surg, 389 Longdejing St, Putian 351100, Fujian, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,64,1,1,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,5.0,,,,,841.0,847,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_5_125,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FA9PC,WOS:000405777000019,,,,,2022-07-14

The clinical features and the genetic basis of this entity are scantily described. Materials and methods: Comprehensive literature retrieval for collecting articles published in English from 2000 to 2016 was the research material of this article. Results: A total of 34 articles were collected with 333 patients involved: 20 (6.0%) of the SVPS cases were congenital and 313 (94.0%) were acquired. Totally 12 (3.6%) patients were in association with syndromes. Postoperative SVPS occured at a mean of 82.7 months following the surgical operation. Management strategies for postoperative SVPS were medical in 1.6%, interventional in 55.6%, surgical in 41.1% and hybrid in 0.8% of the patients. The reintervention rate was 15.9% in the interventional group. The overall mortality was 0.6%. Conclusion: The incidence of postoperative SVPS depends on the follow-up period after surgical operation and the diagnostic criteria of SVPS. For avoiding postoperative SVPS, careful preoperative assessment of the potential surgical outcomes in relation to clinical, hemodynamic, morphological and genetic investigations is mandatory for the decision-making of choices of optimal operative techniques.","[Yuan, Shi-Min] Fujian Med Univ, Teaching Hosp, Hosp Putian 1, Dept Cardiothorac Surg, 389 Longdejing St, Putian 351100, Fujian, Peoples R China","Yuan, SM (corresponding author), Fujian Med Univ, Teaching Hosp, Hosp Putian 1, Dept Cardiothorac Surg, 389 Longdejing St, Putian 351100, Fujian, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,50,4,4,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,5.0,,,,,849.0,856,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_5_126,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FA9PC,WOS:000405777000020,,,,,2022-07-14

Tokyo guidelines provide criteria for the diagnosis and classification of AC. We aimed this study to identify the role of C-reactive protein (CRP) in determining the severity of AC and determine cut-off levels for each group. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis was made of 236 patients diagnosed with AC between January 2009 and January 2015. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Tokyo classification. CRP values of the patients were analyzed and compared among the groups. Results: Disease severity was determined as mild in 57.6%, moderate in 28.8% and severe in 13.6% of the patients. The mean age was 53.7 +/- 18.3 years and the clinical picture was seen to become more severe with increasing age (p<0.05). CRP values of the patients were determined to rise with increasing grade (p<0.05). There was no relationship between CRP and white blood cell (WBC) (p>0.05). The CRP cut-off values were determined as 0.815 mg/dl (sensitivity 44.9%, specificity 34%) for the Grade 1 patient group, 1.095 mg/dl (sensitivity 57.4%, specificity 57.7%) for the Grade 2 patient group and 2.095 mg/dl (sensitivity 71.9%, specificity 69.6%) for the Grade 3 patient group. Conclusion: CRP values may be useful in assessing the severity of AC, and may be considered to be a parameter that could be added to the Tokyo classification.","[Yuzbasioglu, Yucel; Ucoz, Dilber; Icme, Ferhat] Ankara Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Ankara, Turkey; [Haydar, Gullu Ercan; Pekcici, Recep] Ankara Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Ankara, Turkey; [Uzunosmanoglu, Huseyin] Ankara Kecioren Training & Res Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Ankara, Turkey","Icme, F (corresponding author), Ankara Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Clin Emergency Med, Ataturk Egitim & Arastirma Hastanesi Acil, Serv Bilkent, Eskisehir Yolu 2 Km, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",,"İÇME, Doç.

Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II scores were calculated according to data obtained from medical charts. Results: 81 patients of the former study were screened for eligibility and 58 of them were enrolled. Mean age was 69.0 +/- 15.42 years (95 % CI; 30-90) and 55.2 % were male. There were 26 patients in the survivor group and 32 patients were in the non-survivor group. Regression analysis showed no association between mortality and initial RDW values. However, RDW values of last ICU day showed a positive correlation with mortality. APACHE II, SOFA, and SAPS II scores were higher in non-survivor patients than survivors. Conclusion: Whilst there was some correlation between RDW at the end of stay and mortality, RDW had no benefit over existing scoring systems.RDW value does not seem as a promising independent factor but further studies investigating its contribution to current scoring systemsin specific groups can be reasonable.","[Acar, Yahya Ayhan] Etimesgut Mil Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Ankara, Turkey; [Cevik, Erdem] Van Mil Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Altintepe, Van, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Banu Karakus] Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Res & Training Hosp, Sisli Hamidiye Etfal EAH 19 Mayis Mah Sisli Etfal, Istanbul, Turkey; [Cinar, Orhan] Gulhane Mil Med Acad, Dept Emergency Med, Ankara, Turkey; [Yamanel, Levent] Gulhane Mil Med Acad, Dept Intens Care, Ankara, Turkey","Cevik, E (corresponding author), Van Mil Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Altintepe, Van, Turkey.",,"yilmaz, banu karakus/AAA-3646-2020; ACAR, YAHYA AYHAN/ABA-7359-2021; ACAR, YAHYA A/G-3752-2017; Cinar, Orhan/A-5305-2011","ACAR, YAHYA AYHAN/0000-0002-9572-5738; Cinar, Orhan/0000-0001-5097-1276",,,,22,2,2,0,8,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,75.0,79,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700011,,,,,2022-07-14

Nurses working in the operating room, because of the nature of their work, suffer more stress than the others working in different sectors in the hospital which as a result can lead to a desire to leave the nursing profession. This study has been done to identify the correlation between job stress and turnover intentions among the operating room nurses in selected hospitals of Tehran University of Medical Science. Method: This is a kind of descriptive-solidarity study, which was done on 230 workers of nursing staff working in the operating room in selected hospitals of Tehran University of Medical Science. Demographic and Occupational Questionnaire, Osipow Job Stress Questionnaire and Henshaw Scale Turnover Forecast have been used to gather data. The analysis of the data from this study was done by using the SPSS software, version 21, using Descriptive Statistics, Statistical Test and also Gamma Correlation Coefficient and Correlation Coefficient Significant Test was used to investigate the variables. Findings: In the survey conducted, generally in 94.6% of nurses job stress was assessed average. In 42.9% of nurses turnover intentions were moderate, and also there was a significant relation between job stress and turnover intentions (p= 0.002). Conclusion: In their jobs, nurses encounter stressful factors, which affect their general health that can lead to an increase in turnover intentions. So Health authorities should consider specific measures in order to reduce and defuse the existing tension and also create a better and more appropriate condition for nurses and stop them from turnover intensions.","[Ahanian, Elham; Mirzaei, Abasat; Fard, Asieh Salahshoorian] Islamic Azad Univ, Tehran Med Sci Branch, Tehran, Iran","Mirzaei, A (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Tehran Med Sci Branch, Tehran, Iran.",amacademic@yahoo.com,"Mirzaei, Abasat/AAO-8947-2021","Mirzaei, Abasat/0000-0002-1422-5193",,,,26,4,4,0,14,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,2.0,,1045.0,1050,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SU,WOS:000390175400035,,,,,2022-07-14

Bioimpedance indices and phase angle are used frequently in nutritional studies. Phase angle measured by bioimpedance analysis indicates body cell mass and soft tissue mass and changes in the quality and quantity of the mass; therefore, it is used as a nutritional marker. We aimed to evaluate nutritional status of peritoneal dialysis patients by bioimpedance analysis. Materials and methods: 38 peritoneal dialysis patients and 37 healthy individuals were studied. All individuals' bioimpedance indices, phase angle measurements (800 mu A current, 50 kHz frequency) were carried out by using multifrequency bioimpedance device. Nutritional biochemical markers were measured. Results: Peritoneal and control group phase angle were detected 4.48 +/- 0.86 and 5.97 +/- 0.85, respectively (p<0.001). Albumin, total protein, transferrin, potassium, calcium, hemoglobin, HDL-cholesterol levels were significantly lower in peritoneal group. The mean normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) was found to be 1.41 +/- 0.44 g/kg/day, in peritoneal dialysis patients. There was a significant positive correlation between phase angle and nPCR (p=0.001, r=0.516). Phase angle was positively correlated with total protein, transferrin, potassium, hemoglobin, body cell mass/weight (%), lean tissue mass/weight (%), lean tissue index, body cell mass/weight (%), and negatively correlated with age, creatinine, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, C-reactive protein, fat tissue mass/weight (%), fat tissue index. Independent predictors of phase angle were albumin, age and lean tissue index revealed in regression analysis. Conclusion: Phase angle was significantly lower in peritoneal dialysis patients. Bioimpedance parameters, especially phase angle reflect the nutritional status in peritoneal dialysis patients.","[Akdam, Hakan; Ozisik, Melih; Yenicerioglu, Yavuz] Adnan Menderes Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Nephrol, TR-09100 Aydin, Turkey; [Alp, Alper] Izmir Tepecik Training & Res Hosp, Nephrol Clin, Izmir, Turkey; [Ozbek, Ozgul; Kahraman, Aysegul] Adnan Menderes Univ, Adnan Menderes Univ Practice & Res Hosp, Peritoneal Dialysis Unit, TR-09100 Aydin, Turkey; [Arda, Hayri Ustun] Adnan Menderes Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, TR-09100 Aydin, Turkey","Akdam, H (corresponding author), Adnan Menderes Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Nephrol, TR-09100 Aydin, Turkey.",,"Alp, Alper/AAK-2766-2020","Alp, Alper/0000-0002-2864-361X",,,,24,1,1,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,685.0,690,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_75,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400004,,,,,2022-07-14

Hydatid cyst rupture into the peritoneum can cause severe anaphylactic reactions. The most common cause of intraperitoneal hydatid cyst rupture is cyst rupture occurring after trauma. Case presentation: A 25-year-old male patient was brought to the emergency department with a complaint of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure while he was in the bathroom. For 3 days he had been receiving treatment for an influenza infection. His vital signs were blood pressure 140/70 mmHg, pulse 90/min, temperature 37 degrees C, O2 saturation 95%. The patient's physical examination was normal, and his electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm. His cranial computed tomography was normal. His laboratory findings were normal except for hyponatremia, and fluid-electrolyte treatment was provided. During monitoring, he did not develop any acute problem, his hyponatremia resolved and he was discharged with suggestions. The patient was found dead in his bed 5 hours after discharge. The autopsy showed that his death occurred due to a hydatid cyst rupture in his liver. Conclusion: We concluded that the rupture was caused by a minimal trauma occurring during possible tonic-clonic convulsions. This condition should always be considered in a differential diagnosis in Turkey, where hydatid cyst cases are common.","[Akpinar, G.; Altinbilek, E.; Gunduz, H.; Ozturk, D.; Ikizceli, I.] Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Training & Res Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Istanbul, Turkey; [Gulen, B.] Bezmialem Vakif Univ, Fac Med, Dept Emergency Med, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ipekci, A.] Cerrahpasa Med Fac, Dept Emergency Med, Istanbul, Turkey; [Koyuncu, M.] Karabuk Med Fac, Dept Emergency Med, Karabuk, Turkey","Akpinar, G (corresponding author), Sisli Etfal Educ & Training Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Emergency Med, Istanbul, Turkey.",,"altınbilek, ertuğrul/AAB-1368-2019; Gulen, Bedia/DLU-9431-2022; Ipekci, Afsin/E-3443-2017; ikizceli, ibrahim/D-1981-2019","Ipekci, Afsin/0000-0001-6125-4061; ikizceli, ibrahim/0000-0002-9825-4716; ALTINBILEK, ERTUGRUL/0000-0003-4201-8850; Koyuncu, Murat/0000-0001-7446-1641",,,,7,0,0,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,167.0,169,,,,3,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700026,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: Twenty-eight rats were divided into four groups each containing seven rats: Control groups (Group 1: Olive oil group, Group 2: Olive oil+NAC group) and experimental groups (Group 3: CCl4 group, Group 4: CCl4+NAC group). CCl4 was given in 1 ml/kg doses intraperitoneally (i.p.), NAC was given in 50 mg/kg doses. Oligosaccharide units were detected histochemically using biotin labeled lectins. Results: Histochemically, NAC showed no remarkable effect on the staining intensity of biotin labeled lectins. Liver enzyme activities and plasma protein levels were measured using commercial available kits. Compared to the control group in CCl4 given rats AST, GGT and ALP activities increased significantly (P<0.001), while NAC administration alleviated the toxic effects of CCl4. CCl4 decreased serum albumin concentration significantly (P<0.05), however NAC annihilated negative effect of CCl4 on albumin concentration. The alterations in total protein levels and ALT activities remained insignificant (P>0.05). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that cells may increase their oligosaccharide units to protect themselves from the toxic effects of CCl4 and NAC may support cells to scavenge free radicals induced by CCl4.","[Aksit, Dilek] Balikesir Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol, Fac Vet, TR-10145 Balikesir, Turkey; [Atici, Yasemin] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Dept Med Biochem, Fac Med, Antakya, Turkey; [Aksit, Hasan; Kara, Hatibe] Balikesir Univ, Fac Vet, Dept Biochem, Balikesir, Turkey; [Bildik, Aysegul] Adnan Menderes Univ, Dept Biochem, Fac Vet, Aydin, Turkey; [Seyrek, Kamil] Balikesir Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Biochem, Balikesir, Turkey","Aksit, D (corresponding author), Balikesir Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol, Fac Vet, TR-10145 Balikesir, Turkey.",,"Bildik, Ayşegül/AFS-1867-2022; Atıcı, Yasemin/AAK-4656-2021","Atıcı, Yasemin/0000-0003-1833-7595; Bildik, Aysegul/0000-0003-4570-2156",,,,29,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,337.0,341,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000010,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: The biochemical values of 204 patients under chemotherapy evaluation were obtained retrospectively from archive data. Albumin-globulin ratio values were calculated using albumin/total protein-albumin formula. The values of albumin-globulin ratio and albumin were categorized as 3 groups using receiver operating characteristic analysis and a descending order. Results: The calculated cut-off value for albumin-globulin ratio was 1.14: 34.4-79.7 by receiver operating characteristic. The median survival was 20.7 months (15.9-25.5), 20.1 months (15.1-25.1), 16 months (11.8-20.1), respectively in 1st, 2nd, 3rd groups for albumin-globulin ratio (p=0.46). The median overall survival was 18.3 months (123-24.2), 21.6 months (16.8-26.3), 18.01 months (13.5-22.4) in 1st, 2nd, 3rd groups for albumin, respectively (p=0.52). There were no statistical significant differences by Kaplan-Meier method for albumin-globulin ratio, albumin p>0.05. The effects of clinicopathological and biochemical characteristics on mortality were assessed by Cox-proportional hazard regression analysis. The independent predictors of mortality were observed high grade, the presence of perineural invasion of the tumor, high nodal involvement (p:0.01, p:0.001, p:0.01), respectively. Conclusion: Albumin-globulin ratio and albumin values alone may not be useful parameters to predict mortality and survival in patients with gastric carcinoma.","[Aksoy, Asude] Firat Univ, Fac Med, Med Oncol, Elazig, Turkey; [Durak, Serdar; Koca, Suleyman Serdar] Firat Univ, Med Fac Internal Med, Elazig, Turkey; [Ozturk, Turkan] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Fac Med, Med Oncol, Trabzon, Turkey; [Avci, Nilufer] Bursa Ali Osman Sonmez Oncol Hosp, Med Oncol, Bursa, Turkey; [Cirak, Yalcin] Istanbul Bahcesehir Univ, Fac Med, Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Deger, Ayse Nur] Dumlupinar Univ, Fac Med, Pathol, Kutahya, Turkey; [Bilgic, Yilmaz] Inonu Univ, Fac Med, Gastroenterol, Malatya, Turkey; [Ozcan, Mete] Firat Univ, Fac Med, Biophys, Malatya, Turkey; [Goktas, Sevil] Denizli State Hosp, Med Oncol, Denizli, Turkey; [Bozdag, Ahmet] Elazig Educ & Res Hosp, Gen Surg, Elazig, Turkey","Aksoy, A (corresponding author), Firat Univ, Fac Med, Med Oncol, Elazig, Turkey.",,"Bozdag, Ahmet/C-6418-2018; bilgic, yılmaz/ABI-6432-2020; Ozcan, Mete/V-8758-2018","Bozdag, Ahmet/0000-0003-1973-2511; bilgic, yılmaz/0000-0002-2169-5548; Ozcan, Mete/0000-0002-5551-4880; aksoy, asude/0000-0002-5609-9658; Durak, Serdar/0000-0002-8175-9611",,,,30,3,3,2,14,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,707.0,712,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_78,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400007,,,,,2022-07-14

Bleeding represents the most significant complication of warfarin therapy. The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacies of Human Prothrombin Complex (PCC) and Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) for reversal of warfarin-induced anticoagulant effect in the emergency department. Materials and methods: This observational, retrospective study was retrospectively conducted at Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Training and Research Hospital. The study included 32 patients aged over 18 years who presented to the emergency department with warfarin-induced INR elevation and major bleeding. The patients were divided into PCC (Group 1) and FFP (Group 2) groups. The two groups were compared with each other with respect to age, gender distribution, duration of emergency department stay, warfarin dosing schedule (mg/day), bleeding site, amount of PCC (number*10 ml/IU) or FFP (number*200 ml) used for treatment, pre-treatment INR, aPTT levels, and INR, PT, and aPTT levels 15 minutes after FFP and 240 minutes after PCC administration. Results: The two groups were not significantly different with respect to age and gender distribution (p > 0.05). PCC group had an average duration of emergency department stay of 4.8 hours whereas FFP group had an average duration of emergency department stay of 12.25 hours (p<0.05). The number and cost of PCC was significantly greater than FFP (p<0.05). However, the volume of drug was significantly lower in the PCC group (p<0.05) Conclusion: PCC has a limited role in clinical practice due to its cost and limited availability. However, with the possible exceptions of blood transmissible diseases, volume loading, and loss of time, administration of a combination of FFP and vitamin K is not a medically inappropriate practice.","[Altinbilek, Ertugrul; Ozturk, Derya; Ikizceli, Ibrahim] Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Training & Res Hosp, Emergency Dept, Istanbul, Turkey; [Kavalci, Cemil] Baskent Univ, Fac Med, Emergency Dept, TR-06490 Ankara, Turkey","Kavalci, C (corresponding author), Baskent Univ, Fac Med, Emergency Dept, TR-06490 Ankara, Turkey.",,"ikizceli, ibrahim/D-1981-2019; altınbilek, ertuğrul/AAB-1368-2019","ikizceli, ibrahim/0000-0002-9825-4716; ALTINBILEK, ERTUGRUL/0000-0003-4201-8850",,,,31,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,29.0,34,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700004,,,,,2022-07-14

However these therapies, are not without risks and may lead to the transmission of infectious agents from donor to recipient. Screening of blood donations for infectious agents is necessary to achieve transfusion safety. The aim of the study was to determine the six-years seroprevalence of HBV (hepatitis B virus), HCV (hepatitis C virus), HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), and syphilis in blood donors and to present an overview of transfusion transmitted infections in Turkey. Material and methods: A total of 150,787 volunteer blood donors who admitted to blood centers located in Eastern Marmara Region, Turkey between January 2009 and October 2014 were included in this study. HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), anti-HCV (hepatitis C virus antibody), and HIV-1/2 antibody were detected by using Chemiluminescent Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (CMIA) method.. Syphilis screening was performed by using VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) test in the first three years and by CMIA-based treponemal test in the last three years. Results: Among the blood donors, 140,536 (93.2%) were male and 10,251 (6.8%) female. Out of all donors, 2,019 (1.33%) donors were positive for at least one screening test. The seroprevalence of HBV, HCV, HIV, and syphilis were 0.8 % (n=1340), 0.38% (n=578), 0,0025% (n=38) and 0,004 % (n=63), respectively. A significant decrease was observed in HBV seroprevalence by years (p <0.005) Conclusion: The risk of transfusion-transmitted infections can be decreased by effectively using questionnaires and screening tests in blood donation centers, HBV vaccination programs, and awareness-raising activities. It is necessary to use improved screening methods for detection of transfusion-transmitted infection agents.","[Altindis, Mustafa; Koroglu, Mehmet] Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Sakarya, Turkey; [Mutlu, Birsen] Kocaeli Univ, Sch Med, Deparment Infect Dis, Kocaeli, Turkey; [Demiray, Tayfur] Sakarya Univ, Training & Res Hosp Med Microbiol, Sakarya, Turkey; [Dal, Tuba] Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Ankara, Turkey; [Sahin, Idris] Duzce Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Duzce, Turkey; [Kulah, Canan] Zonguldak Bulent Ecevit Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Zonguldak, Turkey; [Ozcelik, Umit] Sakarya Univ, Training & Res Hosp, Ctr Blood, Sakarya, Turkey","Altindis, M (corresponding author), Sakarya Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Sakarya, Turkey.",,"kulah, canan/M-7058-2019; Altindis, Mustafa/O-8413-2019","Altindis, Mustafa/0000-0003-0411-9669",,,,25,0,0,2,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,343.0,347,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000011,,,,,2022-07-14

Epilepsy can have many negative effects on various aspects of all family members' lives, particularly the parents. No qualitative study before was performed on parents of children with epilepsy. From that nurses should be aware about this client's life word for better caring, this study designed. Objectives: This study aimed at exploring experience of parents of children with epilepsy. Patients and methods: This study guided by Van Manen's method of doing phenomenological study. Purposive sampling with maximum variation sampling strategy was used. 10 people participated. The data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews, which were conducted face-to-face with individuals in a quiet room. The interviews were conducted at participants' place and time of choice, and lasted 35 to 100 min. Results: The main theme emerged in this study was fenced in by the child disease. Parents of children with epilepsy have numerous problems; strongly affect the routine of their lives. Our study shows this parents life are deeply affected by child disease. Limitation in relationships, travel restrictions, drop out from school, leaving the job are four sub themes emerged in this study. Conclusions: There is also a need to pay special attention to these families and provide help to them in the Iranian health system, such as using nurses as the large part of the system to relive their pain. Providing counseling for, and educating these parents and using mass media to increase public awareness about epilepsy is also necessary.","[Amjad, Reza Nabi; Navab, Elham; Nasrabadi, Alireza Nikbakht] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Tohid St, Tehran, Iran","Nasrabadi, AN (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Tohid St, Tehran, Iran.",nikbakht@tums.ac.ir,"Nasrabadi, Alireza Nikbakht/F-3768-2014; Nabi Amjad, Reza/R-8621-2017","Nasrabadi, Alireza Nikbakht/0000-0002-3970-4158; Nabi Amjad, Reza/0000-0001-6335-9545",,,,30,6,6,1,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,4.0,,1303.0,1309,,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YQ,WOS:000392283200017,,,,,2022-07-14

These adrenal masses are usually non-functioning and the patients have no symptoms so the diagnosis is incidental. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review for all articles published until April 2015. The initial search identified 98 publications. We considered some characteristics: the mean age of the patients at diagnosis was 59 years (range 19 - 84); there were approximately 1.7 times more female patients than male patients; mean diameter of the lesions was 10.3 cm (range 2 - 25). Surgical treatment was more often open with midline or subcostal Results: From literature analysis we know that small adrenal hemangiomas are usually asymptomatic. Only four patients in our literature review show endocrinologic disturbances with three cases of subclinical Cushing's syndrome and a case of hyperaldosteronism. The pre-operative radiologic features play a fundamental role for correct surgical approach. On enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) scan adrenal hemangiomas tend to be heterogeneous, hypodense lesions with high-density rim of tissue at the periphery. On Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) common findings associated with adrenal hemangiomas are hypointense inhomogeneous masses with central hyperintensity on T1 images and a high intensity peripheral rim on T2 images due to hemorrhage or necrosis. Conclusion: Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is considered the standard treatment in case of benign lesions. Some authors suggest that the main limitation during laparoscopic dissection for large and potentially malign adrenal tumors is incomplete resection and capsular disruption with increased risk of local recurrence and intra-abdominal neoplastic dissemination. We recommend for these patients an integrated multidisciplinary approach that considers endocrine studies, preoperative radiologic findings and the experience of surgical team.","[Antonino, Agrusa; Giorgio, Romano; Giuseppe, Amato; Giuseppe, Di Buono; Vincenzo, Sorce; Leonardo, Gulotta; Gaspare, Gulotta] Univ Palermo, Dept Gen Surg Urgency & Organ Transplantat, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Juliana, Dominguez Ligia; Laura, Vernuccio; Pasquale, Mansueto] Univ Palermo, Geriatr Unit, Dept Clin Med & Emerging Dis, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Roberto, Citarrella] Univ Palermo, Dept Expt Biomed & Clin Neurosci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Massimo, Galia] Univ Palermo, Sect Radiol DiBiMeF, I-90133 Palermo, Italy","Antonino, A (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Gen Surg Urgency & Organ Transplantat, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",,"Di Buono, Giuseppe/AAJ-6311-2020","Amato, Giuseppe/0000-0002-1352-9291; Sorce, Vincenzo/0000-0002-4948-9383",,,,40,18,18,0,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,385.0,389,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000018,,,,,2022-07-14

The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of 8 weeks of sport rock climbing (SRC) training on anxiety in healthy sedentary adults. A total number of nineteen students participated in this study voluntarily composing of a control group (CG, n=10, age 21.90 +/- 1.66 years, height 168.50 +/- 4.40 cm, weight 61.18 +/- 7.08 kg) and an experimental group (EG, n=9, age 21.11 +/- 2.31 years, height 167.33 +/- 6.44 cm, weight 59.31 +/- 8.39 kg). After the EG had been taught basic climbing and rope techniques, body composition and aerobic power measurements were taken for both groups. The EG engaged in climbing training by using a top-rope method for 60 minutes a day with an intensity level of 70 % of HR reserve, three days a week for eight weeks. The CG did not engage in any systematic physical activity program during the study. The Competitive Sport Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2) was given to participants twice. The EG completed the Inventory 20 minutes before the first and the last climbing trial. The CG completed the Inventories on first and last day of 8 weeks period. The results indicated significant changes in all CSAI-2 results for EG, including cognitive (p_=_0.002) and somatic anxiety (p_=_0.032) reduced, self-confidence (p_=_0.001) increased. This current study is one of the first research efforts examining the psychological effects of eight weeks SRC training. Results demonstrated that eight weeks of SRC training significantly reduces cognitive and somatic anxiety and increases self-confidence. In addition to the psychological effects, eight weeks of SRC training also improved the VO2max of participants. This study suggests that SRC can be useful as a regular physical activity in controlling and improving anxiety in the study sample.","[Aras, Dicle] Ankara Univ, Fac Sport Sci, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Ewert, Alan W.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Bloomington, IN USA","Aras, D (corresponding author), Ankara Univ, Fac Sport Sci, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",,"Aras, Dicle/A-7301-2018","Aras, Dicle/0000-0002-9443-9860",,,,68,13,13,0,24,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,223.0,230,,,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700035,,,,,2022-07-14

Material and methods: A total number of 21 (10 male, 11 female) physically active adult college students participated in this study voluntarily. After the informed consent forms were filled out by all participants, and their body composition was measured in the first visit, subjects visited the laboratory four more times with the 2 days of intervals. In every visit a participant's HRV measurement was collected after the hypoxia mask was placed on his/her face, and participant was taken to Wingate Anaerobic Test with the mask. Immediately after the Wingate Anaerobic Test, the HRV was collected again. This procedure was applied at 162 m, 1015 m, 2146 m, and 3085 m of altitude randomly. Results: Despite the fact that all HRV values were significantly different in the comparisons of pre- and post-test results, no change was found in any of SDNN, SDSD, RMSSD, TP, HF, LF/HF, HF, HFnu, LF, LFnu, and VLF parameters depending on the different altitudes. We also found no change on anaerobic power levels.

Malondialdehyde (MDA) generated through decomposition of peroxided lipids influences the intrinsic mechanical properties of the red blood cell (RBC) membrane, which leads to reduced deformability. In this study we investigated effect of MDA on G6PD activity and membrane protein abnormalities in vitro. Materials and methods: The hematological findings were obtained by a blood cell counter and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) for 47 cases. G6PD enzyme activity was measured with Bender's et al. method and MDA levels in plasma were measured by thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assay. Erythrocyte ghosts were prepared according to Dodge et al. method and membrane proteins were separated using on 8.3 % SDS-PAGE. DNA samples were isolated from white blood cells as described by Poncz et al. method to perform amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assays. Results: Total 47 cases were examined as a G6PD deficient, anemic and normal group in this study and found no correlation between parameters statistically. In addition, we found no differences between groups about G6PD, MDA and some RBCs membrane proteins data. Moreover, we found differences between groups to G6PD deficient and anemic or normal samples for spectrin membrane protein data and between normal and G6PD deficient or anemic groups for band 4.1 data. Conclusion: Although in a previous in vivo study indicated that MDA inactivated the enzyme, and the amount of inactivation increased with MDA concentration, we found statistically no correlation between MDA and any other parameters:. This may be due to the prior removal of oxidatively injured cells from the circulation. Since cross-linking of membrane components may stiffen the RBC membrane, injured MDA-rich cells may be removed by splenic entrapment.","[Ariyurek, Sedefgul Yuzbasioglu; Yildiz, Sule Menziletoglu] Cukurova Univ, Vocatinol Sch Hlth Serv, Dept Med Serv & Tech, Adana, Turkey; [Aksoy, Kiymet] Cukurova Univ, Fac Med, Dept Clin Biochem, Adana, Turkey","Ariyurek, SY (corresponding author), Cukurova Univ, Vocatinol Sch Hlth Serv, TR-01330 Adana, Turkey.",,"Yıldız Menziletoğlu, Şule/E-7570-2018","Yıldız Menziletoğlu, Şule/0000-0002-5144-3843",,,,32,1,1,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,367.0,372,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000015,,,,,2022-07-14

It has been claimed that oxidative stress and factors such as metal accumulation in the brain play important roles in the etiopathogenesis of the disease. Material and methods: The subjects of this study consisted of 24 individuals with Alzheimer's disease and 15 healthy agematched controls. Blood samples were withdrawn from the patients and healthy controls, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes SOD (Superoxide Dismutase), GSH (Glutathion), GSHPx (Glutathion peroxidase), GST (Glutathion S-Transferase) and MDA (Malondialdehyde) levels were determined by Spectrometer. Some metals and heavy metals were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Results: Biochemical analyses showed a significant decrease of the main enzymatic antioxidant defences (SOD, GSH, GST and GSHPx) and increased production of lipid peroxidation marker (MDA) in the serum of AD patients, compared to age-matched control group (p< 0.001). Also the levels of Zn, Mg, and Mn was lower and Fe, Pb, and Cd was higher in the patient group, compared to the control group. Serum Cu and Co levels did not differ significantly between the patient and control groups (p> 0.001). Conclusion: These results supports the theory that in AD there is a defect in the antioxidant defense system, which may lead to oxidative damage. Also alterations in some trace metals and their related enzymes may play a role of etiopathogenesis in AD.","[Arslan, Ayse; Demir, Halit] Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Dept Biochem, Fac Sci, Van, Turkey; [Tuzun, Fatma Aykan] Private Kocaeli Hosp Ctr, Dept Neurol, Kocaeli, Turkey; [Tamer, Sibel] Private Sincan Koru Hosp, Dept Neurol, Ankara, Turkey; [Aycan, Abdurrahman] Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Dursun Odabasi Res Hosp, Deparment Brain Surg, Van, Turkey; [Demir, Canan] Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Vocat Sch Hlth Serv, Van, Turkey; [Tasin, Muhterem] Dicle Univ, Dept Neurol, Diyarbakir, Turkey; [Gonullu, Edip] Training & Res Hosp, Dept Anesthesia, Van, Turkey","Arslan, A (corresponding author), Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Dept Biochem, Fac Sci, Tusba, Van, Turkey.",,"Gönüllü, Edip/AAV-7377-2021","Gönüllü, Edip/0000-0002-7751-3758",,,,53,4,4,0,14,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_144,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000015,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: The study was performed with a methodological design. Context, structural, criterion validity and internal consistency reliability and test-retest validity-reliability analysis were performed. The statistical meaningfulness level in all tests was determined as p<0.05. Results: As a result of context validity, factor analysis and item analysis, a 25 item scale with 3 sub components was obtained. In the scale, the variance amount explained by the three sub components was on a very good level (88.64%). The fact that all of the Cronbach alpha, Spearman-Brown and Guttman internal consistency coefficients of the scale and all of its sub components are above 0.70. When the test retest reliability coefficients of the whole scale and its sub components were examined, the scale was found to present consistent results in different applications and the scale was found to be reliable with regard to the constancy coefficient. The ACIS shows highly meaningful correlation with a scale of proven validity and reliability. Conclusion: The Adaptation to Chronic Illness Scale (ACIS), which was just added to literature, is a valid and reliable tool that can be used to evaluate adaptation to illness in individuals with chronic diseases.","[Atik, Derya; Karatepe, Hilal] Osmaniye Korkut Ata Univ, Sch Hlth, Nursing Div, Osmaniye, Turkey","Atik, D (corresponding author), Osmaniye Korkut Ata Univ, Sch Hlth, Nursing Div, Osmaniye, Turkey.",,,,,,,28,7,7,0,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,135.0,142,,,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700021,,,,,2022-07-14

We aimed to investigate the etiological causes of pancytopenia in one-year period. Materials and methods: In this retrospective study, etiological causes of pancytopenia were investigated in patients who were admitted to the hematology and internal diseases clinics of Ministry of Health Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital in 2012. Results: Of 251 patients with pancytopenia who were evaluated, 131 cases were male. The mean age was 58,73 +/- 17,70 years. Etiological causes of pancytopenia were categorized as four main groups, including hematological diseases in 94 patients (37.5%), hypersplenism in 72 patients (28.7%), vitamin B12 deficiency in 46 patients (18.3%), and other causes (autoimmune diseases, infections, etc.) in 39 patients (15.5%). The most common cause of pancytopenia was hypersplenism (n: 72, 28%), followed by vitamin B12 deficiency (n: 46, 18%), acute myeloid leukemia (n: 32, 12%), respectively. Conclusion: Hypersplenism is the most common cause of pancytopenia, even though cause of hypersplenism cannot be found out in half of all patients. Vitamin B 12 deficiency is a common cause that could be diagnosed with complete blood count and serum B 12 level, and be treated within a short time after a supplement or B12 injections, or a high-dose oral vitamin B12 treatment. HIV should be investigated in young patients.

Age, gender, geographical characteristics and genetic affect the distribution of the disease. Despite the treatment, a part of the disease may progress to end-stage renal disease. We evaluated the PGD patients and retrospectively regarding to their clinical and histopathological characteristics. Materials and methods: In this study PGD patients, who have had renal biopsy between 1st January 2009 and 31st December 2014 were evaluated. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, response of the treatment, biopsy evidences, and the risk factors associated with mortality were analyzed. We also compared the cases of primary glomerulonephritis retrospectively. The mean value of the follow-up periods was 22 months (range: 8 - 76 months). Results: The median age was 42 years (18 - 80) in 264 patients. When five groups were compared, there was statistically important difference between the groups (p < 0.001). The distributions of PGD subgroups were 40.5% for membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN), 20.4% for IgA nephropathy (IgAN), 25.7% for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), 7.9% for minimal change disease (MCD) and 5.3% for membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). The distrubition of gender was not significantly in the five PGD groups (p=0.269). Nephrotic syndrome was the most biopsy indication in MGN patients (76.6%). Nephritic syndrome was more seen in immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) patients (63%). Chronic kidney disease was more detected in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) patients as biopsy indication (p<0.001). Minimal change disease (MCD) and IgAN patients were more received with steroid treatment (85.7% and 55.5% respectively). Cyclophosphamide was more received in MGN patients. Serum IgG levels were more higher in FSGS and IgAN patients (p<0.001). Partial remission was more seen in MCD patients. Complete remission was more detected in MGN and FSGS patients. 29.1% of IgAN patients were not received treatment response. Six year renal survival rates were 84.1% (MGN), 87.1% (IgAN), 95.3% (MCD), 64.3% (MPGN) and 76.5% (FSGS) respectively. Conclusion: Biopsy maintains its diagnostic importance in glomerular diseases. Renal functions at diagnosis are important in response to treatment. Early diagnosis, follow-up and appropriate immunosuppressive medications affect mortality and clinical progress in PGD.","[Ayar, Yavuz; Ersoy, Alparslan; Gullulu, Mustafa; Oruc, Aysegul; Yildiz, Abdulmecit] Uludag Univ, Fac Med, Dept Nephrol, Internal Med, Bursa, Turkey; [Can, Fatma Ezgi] Uludag Univ, Fac Med, Dept Biostat, Bursa, Turkey; [Bayrakci, Ismail; Demirayak, Dilay; Duger, Hakan; Ocak, Tugba; Korkut, Bayram; Sahin, Ahmet Bilgehan; Camci, Nihal Yucel] Uludag Univ, Fac Med, Internal Med, Bursa, Turkey; [Vuruskan, Berna Aytac] Uludag Univ, Dept Pathol, Bursa, Turkey","Ayar, Y (corresponding author), Uludag Univ, Fac Med, Dept Nephrol, TR-16059 Gorukle, Turkey.",,"Oruc, Aysegul/AAH-4002-2021; Vuruskan, Berna Aytac/AAH-9746-2021; Ersoy, Alparslan/AAH-5054-2021; Şahin, Ahmet Bilgehan/AAM-4927-2020; Ayar, Yavuz/O-9948-2015","Ersoy, Alparslan/0000-0002-0710-0923; Şahin, Ahmet Bilgehan/0000-0002-7846-0870; ",,,,13,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000027,,,,,2022-07-14

Staphylococcus aureus can asymptomatically colonize the human and is known as responsible for a wide spectrum of illnesses. Many typing methods have been developed to perform subspecies differentiation needed in epidemiological studies. In this context, the aim of the present study was to compare sequence-based typing methods, such as Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and spa typing, in order to assess their discriminatory power and concordance. Materials and methods: 5290 S. aureus genomes were downloaded and used to determine MLST and spa types in silico. To estimate discriminatory power of typing methods and concordance between them the Simpson, adjusted Rand and adjusted Wallace indices have been calculated. GoeBURST and BURP algorithms were used for grouping MLST and spa types. Results: In 76.6% S. aureus genomes the spa and MLST types have been determined. Discriminatory power of spa typing was higher (89.4%) than MLST typing (80.5%). The overall agreement betwee spa typing and MLST at a type level was 39.2%. This have been proved with directional index of partition relation (adjusted Wallace) indicating no more 60% congruence. Conclusion: Concordance between spa and MLST typing data were no so high at a type level because of difference in their discriminatory power. At the same time, level of agreement between MLST and spa clonal complexes have reached 89.4%. Snp correction of MLST clonal complexes excluding MLST types with 3 and more bases distance from clonal complexes have led to 97.2% concordance.

However, there is no ideal one because of its disadvantages and thus there is no commonly accepted guidelines for the selection of the optimal typing method for epidemiological investigations. The aim of the study was an in silico comparison of widely used typing methods, including Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), Staphylococcus aureus Protein A (spa) typing, Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), Multiple Locus Variable-number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) and whole genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST), in terms of discriminatory power and coefficients congruence. Quantitative assessment of discriminatory power and correlation of five typing methods: wgMLST, PFGE, MLST, MLVA and spa typing was performed, by targeting the different sites of the Staphylococcus aureus genome (which had evolved at different rates). Materials and methods: 99 S. aureus whole genomes have been analyzed in silico to determine different (PFGE, spa, MLST, MLVA, wgMLST) subspecies types. Evaluation of the discriminatory power, strength and direction of the congruence of the typing methods was estimated by calculation of the Simpson's index, the adjusted Rand and the adjusted Wallace coefficients. Results: wgMLST was a method with the most discriminatory ability (Simpson's index was 0.992). PFGE and MLVA had the similar resolution power (0.989 and 0.983, respectively), followed by Spa (0.952) and MLST typing (0.919). At the type level, the best congruence of results were found for wgMLST and PFGE (78, 9%). Between spa and MLST types, the concordance was lower (51.2%). Otherwise, adjusted Rand index was below 0.5. On Clonal Complex (CC), Cluster or Group level, there was concordance 49.7% between wgMLST and PFGE. The moderate congruence were for MLVA CC6/8 and MLST CC (adj.

We aimed to investigate the success of LAM treatment in one year period. Materials and methods: We retrospectively recruited 125 naive CHB patients on LAM therapy. We recorded biopsy results, demographic, biochemical, serological and virological values at baseline and 3th, 6th and 12th months of treatment. Virological response was defined as undetectable hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA (<20 IU/mL). Results: Of patients, 81 were male (65%), and the mean age was 42 +/- 13. Mean histological activity index (HAI) was 4.55 +/- 2.16, and fibrosis was 2.65 +/- 0.90 in 114 patients who had biopsy results. The initial mean HBV DNA level was 5.52 x 106 IU/mL. Seroconversion was observed in only 3 (18.75%) of 16 HBeAg (+) patients. While baseline median ALT value was 36 U/L, following values were 28 U/L, 25 U/L and 24 U/L, respectively. HBV DNA significantly and gradually decreased with LAM treatment and it was finally determined to be negative in 80% of the patients in the 12th month. Conclusion: LAM treatment for naive CHB patients continues to be effective for the first 6th months, and if continued to be treated until 12th month, this efficiency can increase. However, it should be kept in mind that any patient with positive HBV DNA are under risk of HBV related complications.","[Balkan, Ayhan; Barutcu, Sezgin; Erdem, Ramazan; Konduk, Bugra Tolga; Yildirim, Abdullah Emre; Gulsen, Murat Taner] Gaziantep Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Univ Bulvari Sehitkamil, TR-27310 Gaziantep, Turkey","Balkan, A (corresponding author), Gaziantep Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Univ Bulvari Sehitkamil, TR-27310 Gaziantep, Turkey.",,"Barutçu, Sezgin/AAD-4552-2019; YILDIRIM, Abdullah Emre/AAG-6561-2020; Gülşen, Murat Taner/AAH-1097-2020","YILDIRIM, Abdullah Emre/0000-0002-4386-9297; Gülşen, Murat Taner/0000-0002-8531-9402",,,,20,0,0,1,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,663.0,667,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_72,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400001,,,,,2022-07-14

Our aim is to reveal the etiological distribution and clinical features of cirrhotic patients. Materials and methods: We retrospectively recruited 1144 patients. Of patients, 480 were cirrhotic, 664 were non-cirrhotic. Patients were diagnosed by means of clinical features, laboratory values, radiologic imaging and biopsy when required. Results: Of the 480 cirrhotic patients, 250 were male (52%), and the mean age was 57.6 years. In cirrhotics, 289 (60.2%) patients were decompensated. However, hepatitis B virus (HBV) - hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection and Budd-Chiari syndrome were found to have highest tendency of decompensation (85.7%, 84.6% respectively). Child-Pugh classification was evaluated: 243 (50.6%) class A, 164 (34.2%) class B and73 (15.2%) class C patients were analyzed. Ascites in 206 (42.9%), hepatic encephalopathy in 55 (11.4%), hepatocellular carcinoma in 23 (4.7%), and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in 17 (3.5%) of the patients were determined. In the group of patients with viral etiology, while 160 (53.9%) of 297 cirrhotic patients were HCV, 137 (46.1%) were HBV, 503 (75.8%) out of 664 non-cirrhotics were HBV and 161 (24.2%) were HCV infected. Conclusion: Although HBV was more common in chronic hepatitides, cirrhosis was mostly caused by HCV infection. The reason of this may be due to anti-viral use for HBV. We found that decompensation rate was higher for Budd-Chiari syndrome and HBV-HCV coinfected patients. Cryptogenic cirrhosis still continues to have high prevalence. The reason for this may be undiagnosed autoimmune liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, occult HBV or gluten enteropathy.","[Balkan, Ayhan; Barutcu, Sezgin; Konduk, Bugra Tolga; Yildirim, Abdullah Emre; Er, Ramazan Erdem; Gulsen, Murat Taner] Gaziantep Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Univ Bulvari Sehitkamil, TR-27310 Gaziantep, Turkey; [Alkan, Samet] Gaziantep Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, TR-27310 Gaziantep, Turkey","Balkan, A (corresponding author), Gaziantep Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Univ Bulvari Sehitkamil, TR-27310 Gaziantep, Turkey.",,"Gülşen, Murat Taner/AAH-1097-2020; alkan, samet/AAA-1025-2020; Barutçu, Sezgin/AAD-4552-2019; YILDIRIM, Abdullah Emre/AAG-6561-2020; er, ramazan erdem/AAA-6063-2021","Gülşen, Murat Taner/0000-0002-8531-9402; YILDIRIM, Abdullah Emre/0000-0002-4386-9297; er, ramazan erdem/0000-0002-9708-1163",,,,19,1,2,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,669.0,674,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_73,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400002,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: The study included 77 voluntary patients admitted to the rheumatology clinic. The control group consisted of 80 healthy individuals. All participants were requested to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepines Scale (ESS), International Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) study group (IRLSSG) rating scale, and SF-36 quality of life questionnaire. The age of pSS onset, age at diagnosis, and age at the beginning of therapy were recorded. Patients with urinary incontinence were evaluated with the incontinence severity index(ISI). Results: The mean scores of the mental health, general health, vitality, physical function, physical role function and emotional role function parameters of the patients were statistically significantly lower than those of healthy volunteers. In the ESS scale, the average score was found to be 7.9 +/- 2.8 in the patient group and 4.5 +/- 2.1 in the control group. The average IRLSSG rating scale score was 13.4 +/- 7.6 in the patient group and 5.4 +/- 5.2 in the control group. The total PSQI score was 7.8 +/- 3.5 in the patient group and 4.11 +/- 1.64 in the control group. There was a statistically significant difference in terms of ESS, IRLSSG rating scale and sleep quality scores. Patients with urinary incontinence (n=26) had significantly higher PSQI and SF-36 scores than patients without urinary incontinence (n=51). Conclusion: Patients diagnosed with pSS have a significantly decreased sleep quality and HRQOL compared with the normal population. Urinary incontinence had a negative impact on sleep and HRQOL. RLS, sleepiness and urinary incontinence are common in patients with pSS.","[Balkarli, Ayse] Antalya Training & Res Hosp, Div Rheumatol, Dept Internal Med, Antalya, Turkey; [Semiz, Murat] Gulhane Mil Med Fac, Dept Psychiat, Ankara, Turkey; [Uslu, Ali Ugur] Eskisehir Mil Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Eskisehir, Turkey; [Yalcinkaya, Soner] Antalya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Urol, Antalya, Turkey; [Can, Beray] Pamukkale Univ, Dept Internal Med, Denizli, Turkey; [Sahin, Muhammed] Necmettin Erbakan Univ, Div Phys Med & Rehabil, Konya, Turkey; [Kucuk, Adem; Tunc, Recep] Necmettin Erbakan Univ, Div Rheumatol, Dept Internal Med, Konya, Turkey; [Solak, Yalcin] Necmettin Erbakan Univ, Div Nephrol, Dept Internal Med, Konya, Turkey","Balkarli, A (corresponding author), Antalya Training & Res Hosp, Div Rheumatol, Dept Internal Med, Antalya, Turkey.",,"Solak, Yalcin/AAD-1393-2020",,,,,43,2,2,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,4.0,,,,,917.0,923,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_110,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DY1XF,WOS:000384887000010,,,,,2022-07-14

Any failure, neglect or committing any action that endangers the child's physical and mental health is considered to be child abuse. The overall objective of this study is comparison of mental health in people with and without experience of child abuse. This was a causal-comparative study. The study population included all 13-15 year old students of second and third levels of middle school in districts 6, 8 and 9 of Tehran in 2014-2015 academic year. Members of the sample group were 215 students who were selected through convenience sampling using sample volume determination method to estimate the relationship and the formula for finite population correction. Child Abuse Self-Report Scale (CASRS) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) were used to collect information. The data were analyzed by SPSS software. Descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation and inferential statistics multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were used to analyze the data. Findings showed that mental health is lower in physically abused people compared to those who have not been physically abused. Also the mental health of people who were sexually abused was lower compared to those without this experience. Mental health of people who experienced emotional child abuse was lower compared to those without this experience. Somatic symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbances, and symptoms of depression are higher in people with experience of negligence child abuse compared to those without this experience. According to the findings and the high prevalence of child abuse and its effects on children's mental health, continuation of these harassments will lead to long-term psychological consequences for children and adolescents.","[Baniasad, Mohammad Hassan] Islamic Azad Univ, Fac Member, Tehran, Iran; [Noghani, Fateme] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Psychol Nursing Fac, Tehran, Iran; [Gerami, Marzieh] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Counseling Psychol, Tehran, Iran","Noghani, F (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Psychol Nursing Fac, Tehran, Iran.",noghanif@sina.tums.ac.ir,,,,,,18,0,0,2,9,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,5.0,,2115.0,2120,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YW,WOS:000392283800037,,,,,2022-07-14

But it is not known which of them is the most suitable regimen. We aimed to compare eradication rates of different eradication protocols. Materials and methods: 273 patients with dyspeptic complaints and naive Helicobacter pylori infection were randomized into three groups: 71 patients received quadruple therapy (QT) (proton pump inhibitor bid, bismuth salts 2x2, metronidazole 500 mg tid and tetracycline 500 mg qid, applied simultaneously for 14 days), 127 patients received concomitant therapy (CT) (proton pump inhibitor bid, amoxicillin 1000 mg bid, clarithromycin 500 mg bid and metronidazole 500 mg tid applied for 10 day) or 75 patients received levofloxacin containing sequential therapy (LST) (amoxicillin 1000 mg bid and proton pump inhibitor bid for first 5 days, following this proton pump inhibitor bid, levofloxacin 500 mg/day, metronidazole tid for remaining 5 days). Results: There were no significant differences in eradication rates between three treatment groups in the intention to treat analysis [QT: 64,8% (53,6-76,0%); CT: 77,2% (70,0-84,4%); LST: 70,7% (65,4-81,1%), P >0.05] and per protocol analysis [QT: 66,7% (55,7%-77,9%) CT: 77,8% (70,5-85,1%), LST: 72,6%,(62,4-82,8%), P >0.05]. Conclusion: None of these three regimens were suitable for the consistent achievement of grade A results.

The purpose of this study was to increase OVD in sports subjects so as to specifically investigate the influence on cervical spine mobility. In particular, we measured cervical range of motion (ROM) before and after increasing OVD in individuals, either with or without malocclusion, analyzing both sports and sedentary subjects. Materials and methods: Participants were divided into two groups: a sports group (SG) and a control group (CG), each including 18 subjects. The SG was composed of sports subjects (age: 20.11 +/- 3.45 yrs; BMI: 25.39 +/- 2.32 kg/m(2)), whereas the CG consisted of age-matched sedentary subjects (age: 25.78 +/- 2.26 yrs; BMI: 24.88 +/- 2.87 kg/m(2)). Cervical range of motion (ROM) was evaluated, by way of an accelerometer (Moover r, Sensor Medica r), before (pre-test) and after (post-test) increasing OVD. Results: The main finding of this study was that sports subjects showed no significant difference, compared to control subjects, in cervical ROM in response to increased OVD. Moreover, we found that sports and sedentary subjects alike showed no significant change in cervical spine mobility as a result of increased OVD, regardless of whether they were affected by malocclusion (class II) or represented subjects with normocclusion (class I). Conclusion: In accord with several studies reported in the literature, the findings of our study indicate that occlusal splints failed to significantly improve the physical-performance endpoint measured, i. e. cervical ROM, in sports subjects as compared to sedentary individuals. Due to the paucity of studies, characterized by conflicting results, there is as yet no compelling scientific evidence as to whether OVD positively impacts sports performance or not. Accordingly, we suggest that further scientific investigation, regarding the relationship between sports performance and OVD, be conducted in the field of sport and exercise sciences.","[Battaglia, Giuseppe; Iovane, Angelo; Bellafiore, Marianna; Patti, Antonino; Traina, Marcello; Palma, Antonio] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Battaglia, Giuseppe; Iovane, Angelo; Bellafiore, Marianna; Patti, Antonino; Traina, Marcello; Messina, Giuseppe; Palma, Antonio] Univ Palermo, Sport & Exercise Sci Res Unit, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Martines, Francesco] Univ Palermo, ENT Sect, BioNeC Dept, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Giustino, Valerio; Messina, Giuseppe] Posturalab Italy, Pavia, PV, Italy","Battaglia, G (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",,"Bellafiore, Marianna/AAN-5526-2021; Giustino, Valerio/AAR-6788-2021; Battaglia, Giuseppe/AAV-3916-2020; Messina, Giuseppe/N-7298-2019","Bellafiore, Marianna/0000-0002-3092-1666; Giustino, Valerio/0000-0002-4575-8021; Battaglia, Giuseppe/0000-0002-7758-7175; Messina, Giuseppe/0000-0003-2774-4950; Traina, Marcello/0000-0003-2373-3621; MARTINES, Francesco/0000-0002-8616-4481; Patti, Antonino/0000-0003-3753-5191",,,,36,12,12,0,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,1589.0,1595,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_135,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000006,,,,,2022-07-14

Improving this, will depend on earlier diagnosis and treatment. Recently it has been reported that inflammatory markers, particularly the neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet 1 lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and to a lesser extent the mean platelet volume (MPV), may be useful in the early diagnosis and prognostication of various malignancies. Objective: To investigate whether the NLR, PLR and MPV may be useful markers for the early diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma. Materials and methods: We retrospectively studied a group of 36 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, comparing them to healthy age and sex matched controls. Full blood counts were used to obtain various hematological indices, including the MPVs and to calculate the NLRs and the PLRs. Unpaired t-tests were used to determine if these differed between patients and controls. Results: Hemoglobin concentrations and lymphocyte counts were both significantly lower in patients compared to controls (P < 0.001). Neutrophil counts, NLRs, and PLRs were significantly higher in patients than in controls (P = 0.012, <0.001, and <0.001, respectively). MPVs did not differ significantly between patients and controls (P = 0.320) Conclusions: Both NLRs and PLRs may be usefid markers for the early diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma. They are almost universally available and easily obtained.","[Bayhan, Zulfu; Zeren, Sezgin; Duzgun, Sukru Aydin] Dumlupinar Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, Evliya Celebi Campus, TR-43100 Kutahya, Turkey; [Kocak, Fatma Emel] Dumlupinar Univ, Fac Med, Dept Biochem, Kutahya, Turkey; [Ekici, Mehmet Fatih] Evliya Celebi Training & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Kutahya, Turkey; [Kahraman, Cuneyt] Dumlupinar Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Kutahya, Turkey; [Kocak, Cengiz] Dumlupinar Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pathol, Kutahya, Turkey","Bayhan, Z (corresponding author), Dumlupinar Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, Evliya Celebi Campus, TR-43100 Kutahya, Turkey.",,"duzgun, sukru/A-9700-2013; Bayhan, Zulfu/AAB-8502-2020; Kocak, Emel Fatma/F-6055-2011","duzgun, sukru/0000-0003-2095-2167; Bayhan, Zulfu/0000-0002-7587-7267; Kocak, Emel Fatma/0000-0001-5549-3883",,,,33,1,1,0,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,111.0,115,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700017,,,,,2022-07-14

We report and discuss the experience of our Centre, an Internal Medicine Unit in North-Western Italy, focusing on the high clinical challenge dealing with this infections in year 2012 with data expanded over three years of surveillance Materials and methods: we retrospectively analyzed data of patients with isolation of CRKP during years 2011-2013. Results: In 2011 2 patients had positive cultures for CRKP; in 2012 CRKP was isolated in 21 patients. The mean age of the cohort was 77,6 (range 52-89). Cultures were positive in different specimens: urines 71,4%, blood 9.52%, upper respiratory tract 9.52%, wounds 9,52%. Most relevant infection-associated risk factors were identified in presence of devices such as urinary catheter (UC) (76% of patients) or central venous catheter (CVC) (47% of patients). In 2013 we observed 6 cases. Cultures were positive on urines, blood and abdominal drainage, blood, sputum and bronchial-alveolar lavage. In conclusion, in three years of surveillance we observed 29 patients with CRKP isolation: 17 urinary tract infections (response 6/13), 4 blood stream infections (response 1/3), 4 respiratory tract infections (response 1/3), 4 skin and soft tissue infections/colonization (not treated); crude mortality was 51% and global response to therapy was 42,1% on 19 treated patients. Conclusions: the 2012 outbreak was contained and the major awareness of the problem produced systematic new measures for infection control: screening with rectal swab for CRKP for patients admitted from other Hospitals or wards, sudden isolation of colonizedlinfected patients, more accurate attention to environmental and personal hygiene. CRPK is an important cause of morbidity and mortality; efficiency of single agent antibiotic therapy against CRPK seems to be not satisfying. Dedicated guidelines of new combination therapy are required.","[Bellodi, Andrea; Del Corso, Lisette; Favorini, Serena; Molinari, Elisa; Ghio, Riccardo; Arboscello, Eleonora] IRCCS AOU San Martino IST, Clin Internal Med 3, Largo Rosanna Benzi 10, I-16132 Genoa, Italy; [Coppo, Erika] IRCCS AOU San Martino IST, Microbiol, I-16132 Genoa, Italy; [Orengo, Giovanni] IRCCS AOU San Martino IST, Clin Risk & Qual Management, I-16132 Genoa, Italy; [Del Bono, Valerio] IRCCS AOU San Martino IST, Clin Infect Dis, I-16132 Genoa, Italy","Bellodi, A (corresponding author), IRCCS AOU San Martino IST, Clin Internal Med 3, Largo Rosanna Benzi 10, I-16132 Genoa, Italy.",,"Bellodi, Andrea/AAB-9016-2020","Bellodi, Andrea/0000-0002-7519-4458",,,,14,1,1,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,823.0,827,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_97,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400026,,,,,2022-07-14

Based on the effects of vitamin D on immune system and endocrine system, the relationship between hypothyroidism and vitamin D gained importance. The relationship between vitamin D deficiency and thyroid was suggested for the first time by Kivity and his colleagues. In their study, they found a significant relationship between thyroid autoantibodies and vitamin D levels. In this study we want to show the relationship between autoimmunity and vitamin D deficiency in female patients with hypothyroidism. Materials and methods: This study was performed at the GOP Taksim Education and Research Hospital outpatient department of internal medicine between January and June in 2015. It included 80 females patients, and 18 control females subjects Results: A total of 98 participants were included in this study. The mean durations of hypothyroidism are 5,86 +/- 5,91 vs. 5,43 +/- 5,62 years. Anti-thyroid autoantibodies (Anti TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (anti TG) levels were significantly higher in the group 1 patients compared to the group 2 patients and control subjects (p<0,01). There were no significant differences at other variables between the patients and control subjects.

Firstly Osteopathy in Italy is not recognized today, despite it being recognized as a profession, it is not considered a medical practice and thus cannot be taught in university faculties of medicine and surgery and the professional figure of an osteopath cannot take part of the hospital staff. This study aims to examine the state of knowledge of the osteopathic profession in the population of pregnant women in relation to the level of study. Materials and methods: The study was performed at the 2nd Family Counseling - Modica Alta USL No. 7 - Ragusa, the counseling Family (ex CT3) - Via G.

The complexity of stroke injury requires a multi factorial approach for improved neurological recovery and increased autonomy. Material and methods: We conducted a longitudinal study on 115 inpatients with a first unilateral stroke and no severe cognitive impairment. Through group randomization, patients were exposed to one of the three following treatment modalities: neuroprotective multimodal pharmacological therapy (NT), physical therapy (PT) and a combination of the above (NT+KT). Reisberg Global Deterioration Scale(RGDS), Tinetti Balance Assessment Tool(TBAT)(Romanian version), and Barthel Index of Daily Activities of Living (BIDAL) were used to assess dimensions of post-stroke functionality. Scores were recorded at baseline (T0) and at one month (T1). Results: RGDS scores showed a marginally significant improvement as a function of time by treatment (p< 0.057, partial eta 2= 0.05). TBAT scores differed significantly based on time by treatment [F(2,112)= 4,82, p< 0.05, partial eta 2= 0.08]. No significant time by treatment differences were found on BIDAL scores. Treatment modality did significantly impact score changes among patients over 70 years (p< 0.01, partial eta 2= 0.11) on RGDS and TBAT, with the most favorable score changes for the NT + KT treatment group.

Our aim was to determine independent predictors of HRR collected during standard cardio-pulmonary stress test (CPT) in a group of overweight/obese subjects without (N = 14) and with type 2 diabetes (N = 19), as compared to a sample (N = 15) of healthy sedentary subjects. Methods: A graded exercise test on treadmill was performed. Oxygen uptake at rest and at peak exercise (VO(2)max), as well as respiratory exchange ratio at peak exercise was collected. Linear and logistic regression was used to assess association between variables collected at CPT and HRR-I and HRR-II. Results: Age, gender, as well as VO2 and HR at rest were all comparable among groups. VO(2)max and HRmax were both lower in diabetic patients as compared to healthy and overweight/obese groups (20 +/- 4.3 vs. 28 +/- 7 vs. 25.1 +/- 5 ml/Kg/min respectively, p < 0.01). VO(2)max had the highest association to HRR-I (R2=0.47) and HRR-II (R2=0.44); VO(2)max < 28 and VO(2)max < 29 were the most accurate cut-off values to identify subjects with abnormally low HRR-I and HRR-II. Conclusions: VO(2)max is an independent predictor of HRR-I or HRR-II, and it is able to discriminate between patients with normal or abnormally low HRR values. Further studies are warranted to test usefulness of a customized exercise program to ameliorate autonomic nervous system balance, therefore reducing global cardiovascular risk.","[Cataldo, Angelo; Zangla, Daniele; Cerasola, Dario; Traina, Marcello] Univ Palermo, Sport & Exercise Sci DISMOT Res Unit, Via Pascoli 6, I-90144 Palermo, Italy; [Bellavia, Diego] Mediterranean Inst Transplantat & Adv Specialized, Div Cardiovasc Dis, Palermo, Italy","Cataldo, A (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Sport & Exercise Sci DISMOT Res Unit, Via Pascoli 6, I-90144 Palermo, Italy.",,"Zangla, Daniele/AAG-8419-2021; Cataldo, Angelo/AAS-4410-2020; Bellavia, Diego/K-3072-2018","Zangla, Daniele/0000-0003-1643-6960; Cataldo, Angelo/0000-0003-3038-4917; Bellavia, Diego/0000-0003-3808-2868; Traina, Marcello/0000-0003-2373-3621",,,,19,0,0,1,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,4.0,,,,,889.0,896,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_106,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DY1XF,WOS:000384887000006,,,,,2022-07-14

Tinnitus might be caused by a homeostatic response of central dorsal cochlear nucleus auditory neurons that makes them hyperactive in compensation to auditory input loss. One hypothesis suggests that tinnitus is a sensory form of epilepsy that involves the cochlear nucleus and the inferior colliculus, which display impairment in the electrical activity in the auditory system. This alteration determines a synaptic plasticity in the dorsal cochlear nucleus that becomes a target for pharmacological compounds able to treat tinnitus. There is no effective drug treatment for tinnitus, but different studies propose the use of cannabinoid receptors agonist for their anti-epileptic activity, although their practical effects are still unclear. In this review, we want to analyze the emerging pharmacological approaches of cannabinoid receptor agonists to the therapy of tinnitus.","[Cavallaro, Angela; Cannizzaro, Carla; Lavanco, Gianluca; Brancato, Anna; Carollo, Gaetano; Cannizzaro, Emanuele; Plescia, Fulvio] Univ Palermo, Dept Sci Hlth Promot & Mother & Child Care Giusep, Via Vespro 129, I-90127 Palermo, Italy; [Martines, Francesco; Salvago, Pietro; Mucia, Marianna; Rizzo, Serena] Univ Palermo, BioNeC Dept, ENT Sect, Palermo, Italy; [Plescia, Fabiana] Univ Palermo, DIBIMED Dept Biotecnol & Biopathol Med, Palermo, Italy; [Martini, Alessandro] Univ Padua, Dept Neurosci, ENT Surg, Padua, Italy","Plescia, F (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Sci Hlth Promot & Mother & Child Care Giusep, Via Vespro 129, I-90127 Palermo, Italy.",,"Plescia, Fulvio/AAZ-2591-2020; Brancato, Anna/P-7418-2017; Martini, Alessandro/K-2513-2018","Brancato, Anna/0000-0002-8635-4146; Martini, Alessandro/0000-0002-2003-6348; CANNIZZARO, Emanuele/0000-0001-7070-209X; PLESCIA, Fulvio/0000-0002-4786-8435; Lavanco, Gianluca/0000-0002-4962-379X; MARTINES, Francesco/0000-0002-8616-4481",,,,77,4,5,1,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,4.0,,,,,903.0,909,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_108,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DY1XF,WOS:000384887000008,,,,,2022-07-14

Since Mg is considered to be natural physiologic 'calcium (Ca) antagonist', the balance between Ca and Mg seems to be more important to reflect its homoeostasis rather than the measurement of serum Mg level. Material and methods: A total of 92 patients (67 male, mean age 61.19 +/- 13.64 years) with the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome were enrolled into this study. Patients were divided into 2 groups by non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. Clinical and demographic characteristics, and the results of blood samples within 24 hour of admission were evaluated. Results: The mean Ca/Mg ratio for the entire subject cohort on admission was 4.28 +/- 0.53. Although serum Ca level was not statistically significantly different between two groups, the patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were found to have significantly low levels of serum Mg as compared to the non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction group (p = 0.004). Consistently, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was associated with higher Ca/Mg ratio as compared those with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. In multivariate linear regression analysis, acute coronary syndrome presentation (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) (Unstandardized Coefficients B = 0.262; 95%CI=0.048 - 0.476; p=0.017) and serum triglyceride (Unstandardized Coefficients B = -0.002; 95%CI=-0.001 -0.000; p=0.027) were found as independent predictors of serum Ca/Mg ratio. Conclusion: The serum Ca/Mg ratio is higher in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients compared those with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. This could be because of a greater decrease in the levels of Mg than in those of Ca.","[Celik, Murat; Koklu, Mustafa; Gusoy, Erol; Yasar, Salim; Gormel, Suat; Yildirim, Erkan; Gokoglan, Yalcin; Yuksel, Uygar Cagdas; Kabul, Hasan Kutsi; Barcin, Cem] Gulhane Mil Med Acad, Dept Cardiol, Ankara, Turkey; [Gungor, Mutlu] Mem Sisli Hosp, Serv Cardiol, Istanbul, Turkey","Celik, M (corresponding author), Gulhane Mil Med Acad, Dept Cardiol, Cardiol, TR-06018 Etlik, Turkey.",,"yuksel, uygar cagdas/AAA-5958-2021",,,,,30,4,4,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,691.0,697,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_76,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400005,,,,,2022-07-14

Their incidence is less than 1% in general population. They are generally located in the submucosa and their distribution tends to favor the right colon. Most cases are asymptomatic and do not require any special treatment. Lipomas larger than 2 cm tend to be symptomatic and are mistaken for cancer. Clinical series: Sixteen patients of colonic submucosal lipomas operated between 2000 and 2013 were analyzed as regards of age, gender, clinical symptoms, tumor localization, diagnostic tools, size of tumor, complications and treatment modalities. Six patients were women. The mean age was 51 years (range 35-86). The size of the tumors were measured between 0.8-6 cm. Four patients required urgent abdominal exploration and twelve patients underwent elective surgery with the diagnosis of colonic tumoral lesion. The reason for urgent exploration was colonic obstruction as a result of intussusception caused by colonic lipomas. In two patients, colonic lipomas were diagnosed coincidentally with a colonic carcinoma and a colonic diverticulosis. Surgical pathologic examination confirmed colonic lipomas in all cases. There was no mortality. During postoperative follow-up period, the patients were free of symptoms and there was no recurrence. Conclusion: Colonic lipoma although rare, should be kept in mind while evaluating the adult patient with colonic submucosal tumor or with colonic intussusceptions to avoid unnecessary wide resections.","[Cin, Necat; Tavusbay, Cengiz; Kar, Haldun; Durak, Evren; Peker, Yasin; Tatar, Fatma; Bag, Halis; Er, Ahmet; Tarcan, Ercument; Haciyanli, Mehmet] Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Ataturk Teaching & Training Hosp, Dept Surg, Izmir, Turkey","Cin, N (corresponding author), Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Ataturk Teaching & Training Hosp, Dept Surg, Izmir, Turkey.",,"kar, haldun/R-6845-2019; Haciyanli, Mehmet/V-8008-2017; HACIYANLI, MEHMET/P-6709-2019","HACIYANLI, MEHMET/0000-0002-0512-1405",,,,22,0,0,1,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,399.0,404,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000020,,,,,2022-07-14

Diastolic HF is also known as HF with preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF). We here in evaluated the effect of volume status on development of arterial stiffness and diastolic HF in patients with normal or near-normal LV systolic function. Materials and methods: A total of 75 chronic patients with PD and 52 age- and gender-matched control subjects were included in this study. Fluid overload (FO) was determined using multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (mBIA). LVEF, peak velocity of atrial filling (E/A ratio), left atrium diameter (LAD), LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), and LV end-systolic diameter (LVESD) were obtained using echocardiography (ECHO). Brachial-ankle artery pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and augmentation index (AIx) were measured to determine AS. Results: Of a total 75 patients, 56 (59.6%) were undergoing continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD). The mean values for systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure (PP) were 130 +/- 24, 80 +/- 17, 103 +/- 19, and 50 +/- 16 mmHg, respectively. The mean SBP, LAD, and LV mass index (LVMI)(all p < 0.005) were higher and the E/A ratio (p = 0,000) was lower in patients with PD than in healthy controls. Comparison of hypervolemic and normovolemic patients showed that the mean SBP, LAD, LVEDD, LVESD, and LVMI (all p < 0.005) were significantly higher and the mean LVEF (p = 0.003) was significantly lower in the hypervolemic group, whereas the mean DBP, MAP, baPWV, PP, and AIx were not significantly different between the two groups (all p > 0.005). Multivariate regression analysis adjusted for ECHO parameters revealed that age (beta = 0.733, p = 0.001), diabetes status (beta = 0.184, p = 0.027), and SBP (beta = 0519, p = 0.001) were independently associated with increased baPWV. Conclusions: Overhydration (OH) was higher in patients with PD than in healthy controls and was associated with development of diastolic HF in patients with PD. Additionally, age, SBP, and diabetes status and not FO were independent predictors of baPWV in patients with PD.","[Coban, Melahat; Inci, Ayca; Sarikaya, Metin; Dolu, Suleyman] Antalya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Kazim Karabekir St, TR-07100 Antalya, Turkey; [Erkal, Zehra] Antalya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Cardiol, TR-07100 Antalya, Turkey; [Sari, Funda; Cetinkaya, Ramazan] Akdeniz Univ, Fac Med, Dept Nephrol, Antalya, Turkey","Inci, A (corresponding author), Antalya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Kazim Karabekir St, TR-07100 Antalya, Turkey.",,"Cetinkaya, Ramazan/C-7018-2016","Cetinkaya, Ramazan/0000-0001-8137-0385",,,,47,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,757.0,765,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_86,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400015,,,,,2022-07-14

In this study, we investigated the causes of hyperammonemia in noncirrhotic patients with encephalopathy. The aims of this study were identifying risk groups of patients who can present with hyperammonemic metabolic encephalophaty. Materials and methods: This retrospective, observational, descriptive, sectional clinic study was conducted in a tertiary level training and research hospital between July 2013 and October 2015. Blood ammonia levels were analyzed in metabolic encephalopathy patients who have presented to the emergency department (ED). Results: Among 135 patients (54 patients had cirrhosis and 81 patients did not have cirrhosis) enrolled in this study Mean age was 57 years (range 18-88 years). 67 % of the patients were male (n= 90) and 33% of the patients were female (n= 45). In cirrhotic group although mean values of ammonia got higher as Child-Pugh class raised from A to C (164.2, 202 and 248 mu g/dl respectively) the difference was not statistically significant. In noncirrhotic group we found remarkable increased ammonia level in the patients with epilepsy or patients who have seizure (n: 37, ammonia level: 110,49 (18-687)), patients with urinary problems (n: 27, ammonia level: 135,88 (18-687)), patients with sepsis (n: 28, ammonia level: 133,09 (29-687)), and patients who have starvation or oral intake difficulty (n: 24, 133,7 (20,90-687)) Conclusion: Blood ammonia levels are useful in differential diagnosis of adult patients who present to ED with new or acute mental status changes of unknown cause. Ammonia levels may be elevated in noncirrhotic patients. Urinary problems, epilepsy or seizure, starvation or oral intake difficulty can be the cause of hyperammonemia. In clinical practice when evalutating patients with hyperammonemia emergency physicians should be familiar with causes other than cirrhosis.","[Coskun, Selcuk; Gunaydin, Gul Pamukcu; Celik, Gulhan Kurtoglu; Ersen, Teoman; Sener, Alp; Gokhan, Servan] Ankara Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Bilkent Yolu 3 Km, Ankara, Turkey; [Coskun, Ekrem Kadir] TOBB ETU Hosp, Dept Qual & Stat, Ankara, Turkey","Coskun, S (corresponding author), Ankara Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Bilkent Yolu 3 Km, Ankara, Turkey.",,"gunaydin, gul pamukcu/AAD-2173-2020","gunaydin, gul pamukcu/0000-0001-8531-4591; SENER, ALP/0000-0002-0583-2936",,,,16,0,0,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,4.0,,,,,1021.0,1028,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_126,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DY1XF,WOS:000384887000026,,,,,2022-07-14

However, infective complications as mediastinitis still represent a major problem in terms of morbidity and mortality in cardiac surgery, with severe suffering of the patient. Furthermore, the incidence of this complication has remained stable over the last three decades and this condition also determines a significant prolongation of hospitalization with an increase in costs. The procedures used for the treatment of mediastinitis have undergone deep modifications over the years but, in despite of these improvements, mortality has remained high. Over the last years, the negative pressure therapy (ie the Vacuum Assisted Closure-Therapy) is taking over all the other treatments. Materials and method: From January 2010 to December 2015, at University of Bari Cardiac Surgery Center have been performed 3123 median sternotomy for cardiac surgery. Deep sternal wound infection occurred in 35 patients (1.1207%). In all of these patients was performed vacuum therapy. Results: The duration of vacuum treatment was 14.4 +/- 6.7 days. Inflammatory indexes showed a marked decline. At the end of vacuum therapy, in some cases, the reconstruction of the wound was carried out with plastic reconstruction by means of a pectoral flap. No deaths for mediastinitis were recorded, neither any relapse or treatment-related complication. Hospital stay was 30.4 +/- 13.5 days from the beginning of treatment. Conclusion: The results obtained in our center with vacuum therapy are much more better than those obtained with classic procedures used in the past. Based on our experience and from analysis of literature, vacuum therapy should be the procedure of choice for the treatment of post-sternotomy mediastinitis. Furthermore, this approach has shown satisfactory results in terms of hospital stay time and costs.","[D'Agostino, Donato] Aldo Moro Univ Bari, Dept Emergency & Organ Transplantat, Sect Cardiac Surg, Bari, Italy; [Man, Adrian] Univ Med & Pharm Tirgu Mures, Microbiol, Targu Mures, Romania; [Santacroce, Luigi] Aldo Moro Univ Bari, Sch Hlth Profess, Bari, Italy; [Santacroce, Luigi] Aldo Moro Univ Bari, Lab Microbiol & Virol, Ionian Dept, DISGEM, Bari, Italy","D'Agostino, D (corresponding author), Corso Vittorio Emanuele 143, I-70122 Bari, Italy.",d.dagostino@live.it,"Man, Adrian/M-3475-2016; Santacroce, Luigi/B-5466-2016","Man, Adrian/0000-0001-5281-0601; Santacroce, Luigi/0000-0001-5671-8124; D'AGOSTINO, DONATO/0000-0001-5887-7655",,,,40,4,4,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1905.0,1910,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_181,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300025,,,,,2022-07-14

Despite developments in diagnosis and treatment techniques, the disease may progress after operation despite adjuvant treatment combinations((2)). Thus, early diagnosis is important. In this study, the role of the systemic immune response (SIR) was assessed by the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the thrombocyte/lymphocyte ratio (TLR) in relation to the diagnosis of gastric malignant-benign pathologies performed using upper gastrointestinal system endoscopy. Material and methods: In total, 1916 patients were included in this study, of whom 964 (50.3%) were male and 952 (49.7%) were female. All subject had undergone upper gastrointestinal system endoscopy in the Batman Regional State Hospital Endoscopy Unit between 2010 and 2012. Results: When SIR was evaluated with the NLR, it was positive in 1415 (73.9%) patients. When the patients were grouped based on their pathological diagnosis, there was no relationship between the pathological diagnosis and the SIR determined by the NLR (p=0.629). When SIR was evaluated with the TLR, it was positive in 1450 (75.7%) patients. When the patients were grouped based on their pathological diagnosis, there was no relationship between the pathological diagnosis and the SIR determined by the TLR (p=0.944). Endoscopy is a standard method for the differential diagnosis of gastric pathologies. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that NLR and TLR, which are indicators of the systemic inflammatory response, do not play a role in increasing the diagnostic strength of endoscopy. Additionally, we believe that easily accessible, cheap, and easy-to-use laboratory methods can be developed with further studies on this topic.","[Degirmen, Elif; Akin, Selcuk] Batman Reg Goverment Hosp, Minist Hlth, Dept Biochem, Batman, Turkey; [Yildirim, Mustafa] Medicalpk Gaziantep Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Mucahitler Mh 52063 Sk 2 Sehitkamil, TR-27090 Gaziantep, Turkey; [Dayanan, Ramazan] Batman Reg Govt Hosp, Minist Hlth, Dept Internal Med, Batman, Turkey; [Efe, Savas Cumali] Batman Reg Goverment Hosp, Minist Hlth, Dept Gastroenterol, Batman, Turkey","Yildirim, M (corresponding author), Medicalpk Gaziantep Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Mucahitler Mh 52063 Sk 2 Sehitkamil, TR-27090 Gaziantep, Turkey.",,,,,,,22,0,0,2,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,373.0,376,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000016,,,,,2022-07-14

On the other hand, investigating this concept is essential to the development of nursing as a profession. Therefore, it is necessary to understand and clarify professional identity and describe its attributes. Material and methods: The framework of this study is Roger's evolutionary method. After a systematic electronic search in MEDLINE, OVID, PROQUEST, and SCIENCE DIRECT databases, 57 articles on nursing and health sciences and 8 nursing theses were analyzed. Results: Five attributes were identified and professional identity was defined as an evolving process resulting from the integrity of education and experience, knowledge and caring, personal and professional identity, and values that is related to group interactions at workplace. Conclusion: Professional identity is a complex and multidimensional concept with gender, social, historical, cultural, political, and organizational considerations. The findings of this concept analysis could guide further researches on nursing professional identity.","[Dehghanzadeh, Shadi; Khajeh, Mahboobeh] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Tehran, Iran; [Nayeri, Nahid Dehghan] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Nursing & Midwifery Care Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran","Dehghanzadeh, S (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Tehran, Iran.",,"nayeri, nahid dehghan/W-6041-2019; khajeh, Mahboobeh/ABA-6129-2021; Klein, Richard G/B-5910-2009; dehghanzadeh, shadi/R-5058-2017","nayeri, nahid dehghan/0000-0003-1594-6790; khajeh, Mahboobeh/0000-0002-0684-9481; ",,,,16,0,0,0,9,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,2.0,,1111.0,1114,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SU,WOS:000390175400047,,,,,2022-07-14

Material and methods: We enrolled 288 subjects (169 women, 119 men) who were admitted to Clinic of Internal Medicine, Ankara Education and Research Hospital. They underwent physical examinations and anthropometric evaluation. They also underwent ultrasonography and blood samples were collected for further investigation. After cut-off values for visceral fat were determined, female and male subjects were classified as they were viscerally obese or not obese and all their parameters were compared. Results: Female viscerally obese subjects had statistically higher values of blood glucose, blood pressure, insulin, cholesterol, triglyceride and homeostasis model assessment - insulin resistance index than female Who were not obese. Men with visceral obesity had higher values of blood pressure, insulin, triglyceride and homeostasis model assessment - insulin resistance index than men who were not obese. Conclusions: Visceral obesity was linked to high blood pressure, triglyceride, insulin resistance in all subjects, but high blood glucose, total cholesterol levels were elevated only in females. We think that visceral fat thickness measured by ultrasonography can estimate not only visceral obesity but also risks of cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome both in females and males.","[Demirbas, Berrin] TOBB ETU Univ, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, Ankara, Turkey; [Gursoy, Gul] Kafkas Univ, Dept Internal Med, Kars, Turkey; [Simsek, Meltem; Bahsi, Remzi] Minist Hlth, Dept Internal Med, Ankara, Turkey; [Simsek, Meltem; Bahsi, Remzi] Educ & Res Hosp, Ankara, Turkey; [Kosar, Pinar; Usta, Behice Merve] Minist Hlth, Ankara Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Radiol, Ankara, Turkey","Demirbas, B (corresponding author), Tobb Etu Hosp, Dept Endocrinol, Yasam 5, TR-06510 Ankara, Turkey.",,"Bahşi, Remzi/AAO-9073-2021","bahsi, remzi/0000-0003-1715-6856",,,,40,1,1,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,45.0,50,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700006,,,,,2022-07-14

Mean platelet volume (MPV) provides a measurement of activated platelets; increasing platelet activation is one of the mechanisms that may link depression and ischemic cardiac disease. Material and method: 100 newly diagnosed patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 100 healthy controls admitted to our outpatient clinics. We started selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment in the MDD patients and followed them for 3 months. Patients' laboratory tests and physical, neurological, and psychiatric examinations were performed both at diagnosis and after 3 months of treatment. Results: The MDD group consisted of 90 people and the control group consisted of 88 people met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. There was no significant difference between the ages of the groups (p = 0.28). There were more males within the MDD group (55.6%). MPV was significantly greater in MDD group (p<0.001); MPV levels showed significantly decline after treatment with SSRIs (p<0.001). The platelet counts were also significantly low in MDD patients when compared with the control group, with the difference being statistically significant (p<0.001). No significant difference was observed in platelet counts after treatment. Severity of depression also declined after treatment. The average Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score decreased 9.23 points; the difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). Conclusion: We conclude that MPV can be an indicator of platelet activity in patients with MDD and SSRIs can be used along with MPV to help identifying and treating coronary artery disease in MDD patients. According to our findings, SSRIs may have an antiplatelet action in addition to their antidepressant effects, which may be beneficial for MDD patients with coronary artery disease.","[Demircan, Fatih] Private Cagri Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Elazig, Turkey; [Gozel, Nevzat] Firat Med Fac, Dept Internal Med, Elazig, Turkey; [Kilinc, Faruk] Dicle Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Diyarbakir, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Musa] Firat Med Fac, Dept Biochem, Elazig, Turkey; [Donder, Emir; Atmaca, Murad] Firat Med Dept Psychiat, Ankara, Turkey","Demircan, F (corresponding author), Private Cagri Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Elazig, Turkey.",,"Atmaca, Murad/V-9377-2018; Donder, Emir/V-8352-2018; faruk, kilinc/W-7108-2018","Gozel, Nevzat/0000-0001-7326-6860; kilinc, faruk/0000-0002-0198-2558; donder, emir/0000-0003-2537-6023",,,,27,1,1,1,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,93.0,96,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700014,,,,,2022-07-14

Through questionnaire analyses and image analysis, 1200 martial arts sportsmen were brought into such clinical investigation, and the specific causes for their knee joint injuries were comprehensively analyzed. In addition, during the athletic rehabilitation period, the sports intensity and content were comprehensively adjusted. Results show that, high challenge training and common martial arts routine are of basic causes for knee joint injury of martial arts sportsman. Of all 1200 sportsmen, the injured ones account for 61% (73211200), moreover these injuries were significantly related to factors such as individual quality, age; years doing martial arts. In addition, by adjusting lite training content, the curative efficiency,was significantly improved and the curative effect was very significant. From such investigation we can conclude that knee joint inlay is the most common type of sport injury for martial arts sportsman, and the cause is relatively complex and can be subjective or objective. Therefore, to decrease the occurrence rate of knee joint injury, knowledge must be promoted to decrease the occurrence rate of injury from :subjective and objective aspects, so as to provide a better guarantee for the physical health of martial arts sportsmen.","[Ding, Yu] Northwest Univ Polit & Law, Dept Phys Educ, Xian 710063, Peoples R China","Ding, Y (corresponding author), Northwest Univ Polit & Law, Dept Phys Educ, Xian 710063, Peoples R China.",,,,Project of the major theoretical and practical issues in the social sciences of Shaanxi Province: Study on the socialization of school sports resources in Shaanxi Province [2011C066]; Xi'an Social Science Fund Project self project: Feasibility study of Qinling Mountains development of car camping tourism industry [11Y021],1.

Tins study was planned to define the contribution of clinical and radiological features in the course of action for AUS/FLUS and FN/SFN thyroid nodules. Materials and methods: The age, gender, nodule size and definitive pathological results of 124 patients treated with total thyroidectomy after preoperative diagnosis of AUS/FLUS and FN/SFN lesions were recorded. Radiological features were grouped as increased vascularity, irregular borders, microcalcification, cystic component, presence of hypoechoic halo, hypoechogenicity and extraglandular involvement. Results: The malignancy rates in AUS/FLUS and FN/SFN lesions were 8% and 163%, respectively. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was repeated only in 8 patients among 75 patients diagnosed as AUS/FLUS, but the diagnosis was not changed in direction to follow-up. The presence of irregular borders at ultrasonography, increased vascularity, microcalcification, presence of hypoechoic halo and hypoechoic nodules were found to be related to the malignancy in AUS/FLUS group. On the other hand, age less than 50, presence of irregular borders, increased vascularity and presence of microcalcifications were found to be related to the malignancy in FN/SFN group. Conclusions: The success of BSRTC in prevention of unnecessary thyroidectomies shows differences between clinics. Radiological criteria apart from patient's related factors play an important role in clinical judgement. Microcalcifications seem to be the most sensitive criteria both in AUS/FLUS and FN/SFN lesions.

The aim of this study is to determine the effect of one night of bi-level positive airway pressure (BPAP) treatment on the basal metabolic rate (BMR) of OHS patients. Materials and methods: The BMR of OHS patients who were newly diagnosed and hospitalized for BPAP treatment was measured with indirect calorimetry before and after one night (at least 8 hours) BPAP treatment. Additionally association between BMR and parameters such as gender, smoking, body-mass index (BMI), oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) were assessed. Results: Twenty newly diagnosed OHS patients were included in the study. A statistically significant difference in BMR and VO2 levels were observed after one night of BPAP treatment (p=0.01 and p=0.02, respectively). There was no statistically significant relationship between the reduction in BMR and gender, smoking and BMI. Lower VCO2 levels were measured after the BPAP treatment but there was no statistical significance. Conclusion: Even short term use of BPAP treatment in patients with OHS may reduce the BMR by improving pulmonary mechanics and respiratory muscle capacity and reducing breathing effort. Longer studies with more patients are needed to evaluate both short and long term effect of BPAP treatment on BMR.","[Dogru, Gonca] Isparta State Hosp, Dept Pulm Med, TR-32100 Isparta, Turkey; [Boyaci, Hasim; Baris, Serap Argun; Basyigit, Ilknur; Yildiz, Fusun] Kocaeli Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pulm Med, TR-41000 Kocaeli, Turkey; [Onyilmaz, Tugba] Konak Special Hlth Ctr, Dept Pulm Med, TR-41000 Kocaeli, Turkey; [Dogru, Atalay] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, TR-32000 Isparta, Turkey","Dogru, G (corresponding author), Isparta State Hosp, Dept Pulm Med, TR-32100 Isparta, Turkey.",,"BASYIGIT, ILKNUR/G-3607-2018",,Kocaeli University Coordination Unit of Scientific Research Project,This study was supported by the Kocaeli University Coordination Unit of Scientific Research Project.,,27,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_154,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000025,,,,,2022-07-14

Conclusion: the average scores of interns with regards to knowledge and attitude were in order 62.8 and 53.03 percent, the knowledge and attitude level of interns was medium. In fact, this level needs further development. Therefore, according to past studies suggesting the significance of education on physicians' knowledge and attitude, it seems vital to formulate more precise and consistent educational programs which can lead to knowledge and attitude development of interns in this field.","[Drkarami, Afsaneh; Parvin, Shirighidari; Drvakili, Mohammadmasoud; Draminian, Iman; Shahram, Drsamadi] Zanjan Univ Med Sci, Zanjan, Iran","Parvin, S (corresponding author), Zanjan Univ Med Sci, Zanjan, Iran.",p.shiri47@gmail.com,,,,,,18,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,2.0,,1003.0,1006,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SU,WOS:000390175400026,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: 24 healthy SD rats (male) were randomly divided into the control group (A), exhaustion group (B), and exhaustion and medicine group (C). All groups are provided with free access to water and essential fodder. Subjects in Group C were administered Sedi Herba 3 hours before exercise, 400 mg/kg, through gavage. During the experiment, the control group was feed without any exercise while Group B and C went through a one-week adaptive training on the treadmill, which is further followed with a seven-week-long endurance exercise with increasing load. At the last day of the experiment, subjects from Group B and C were forced to exercise to exhaustion and decapitated immediately, while those from the control group were killed without exercise. Liver tissues from all subjects were collected and made into tissue homogenate as required in this experiment. Indicators of body defense system against free radicals were measured, including content of malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation, activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), activity of catalase (CAT), activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC). Results: The increase in Group C in SOD activity, CAT activity, GSH-Px activity and the T-AOC was statistically significant, as compared to the other groups, among which that of SOD and GSH-Px far exceeded the data collected in Group B (P<0.01). Moreover, content of MDA in Group C decreased significantly (P<0.01) when compared with group B. Further, Sedi Herba extended the exercise before exhaustion for 21.30%. Conclusion: Sedi Herba can significantly improve the activity of free radical-clearing enzymes in liver tissue of rats and the exercise capacity.","[Du, Yangjun] Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, Dept Phys Educ, Yangling City 712100, Shaanxi Provinc, Peoples R China; [Wang, Liping] Northwest A&F Univ, High Sch, Yangling City 712100, Shaanxi Provinc, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Zhengying] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Inst Sports Biol, Xian 710119, Shaanxi Provinc, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shaojie] Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Dongfang Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Beijing 100078, Peoples R China","Wang, SJ (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Dongfang Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Beijing 100078, Peoples R China.",markwang64@163.com,,,,,,10,1,1,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1881.0,1884,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_177,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300021,,,,,2022-07-14

The purpose of this study was to examine the success rate and the effects of an outpatient weight loss program on obese OSA patients. Materials and methods: This prospective study included 34 apneic obese patients (body mass index 33.7 +/- 5.8 kg/m(2), age 47.1 +/- 8.7 years). Intervention program consisted of 12-week program of moderate intensity exercise (40-60% of HRR) and individualized diet. A weight loss of >= 3% from baseline was considered as clinically significant weight loss according with the guidelines of American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). Polysomnographic, anthropometric and metabolic measurements were taken before and after the significant weight loss. Data were analyzed using the Chi square test, Wilcoxon signed ranks test and Mann Whitney U test. Results: Clinically significant weight loss was achieved by 18 patients (53%), and 16 patients (47%) were unsuccessful. It was significant that mild /moderate OSA patients were mostly successful (68%), while the majority of severe patients (75%) were unsuccessful (P = 0.016). There were significant improvements in anthropometric, metabolic and sleep parameters (apnea-hypopnea index, O-2 desaturation index, Epworth sleepiness score) of successful patients after 12 weeks program. Conclusion: Outpatient weight loss programs are more convenient for patients with mild /moderate OSA. However, obese patients with severe OSA have more barriers to perform exercise. Inpatient weight loss program seems like a better option for obtaining effective weight loss in severe apneic patients.","[Eraslan, Ali] Antalya Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Sports Med, TR-07100 Antalya, Turkey; [Selcuk, Omer Tarik; Eyigor, Hulya; Osma, Ustun] Antalya Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Antalya, Turkey; [Erkal, Zehra] Antalya Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Antalya, Turkey","Eraslan, A (corresponding author), Antalya Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Sports Med, TR-07100 Antalya, Turkey.",,"Selcuk, Omer/AAJ-3450-2021","Selcuk, Omer/0000-0002-7364-7599; Eraslan, Ali/0000-0001-6909-8198",,,,38,2,2,1,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_153,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000024,,,,,2022-07-14

Certain anticonvulsing, immunosuppressive and antihypertensive drugs are the underlying cause in most cases. Among them, cases due to amlodipine are very rare. Here we discuss the topic along with a case of gingival overgrowth induced by amlodipine. Case presentation: A sixty-three-year-old male presented with gingival overgrowth and hemorrhage. He was on warfarin and amlodipin because of prosthetic aortic valve and primary hypertension. He had gingival hyperplasia increasingly growing in the last couple of months. His antihypertensive regimen was readjusted with cessation of amlodipine. Discussion: The pathogenesis of drug induced gingival hyperplasia is not totally understood yet, it is obviously related to gingival infalmmation. Treatment strategy is cessation of the inducing agent, providing oral hygiene and gingivectomy if necessary. Concomitant use of warfarin in our patient was another contributing factor for his tendency to gingival hemorrhage. Replacing amlodipine with different antihypertensives and appropriate dental care ensured the recovery of gingival lesions in the follow up period. The patient continued warfarin treatment without hemorrhagic complications. Conclusion: Calcium channel blockers (CCB) are antihypertensives that we commonly prescribe. We may be able to avoid serious complications if we bear in mind that these drugs may cause gingival overgrowth especially when dental care is poor.","[Erken, Ertugrul] Gaziosmanpasa Univ, Fac Med, Dept Nephrol, Tokat, Turkey","Erken, E (corresponding author), Gaziosmanpasa Univ, Fac Med, Dept Nephrol, Ali Sevki Erek Yerleskesi Tip Fak, Merkez, Tokat, Turkey.",,"Erken, Ertugrul/P-4517-2015","Erken, Ertugrul/0000-0002-7054-1203",,,,16,2,2,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_138,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000009,,,,,2022-07-14

Findings: Factors affecting Iranian family donors' motivation for kidney donation fell into three main categories including feelings of love and responsibility, spiritual motives, and greater success rate of family donor transplant. The first category consisted of the two sub-categories of close and constant companionship and inability to tolerate recipient's discomfort. Conclusion: The findings of the present study indicate that both personal factors (such as feeling of responsibility and spiritual motives) and organizational factors (such as informing family members about the importance and the benefits of family donation) are among the main motives for kidney donation by family members. Employing strategies for promoting these factors could facilitate the process of kidney donation by family members.","[Farahani, Ziba Borzabadi] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Nursing Educ, Tehran, Iran; [Farahani, Ziba Borzabadi] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Sch Nursing, Tehran, Iran; [Esmaeili, Maryam; Salsali, Mahvash; Nayeri, Nahid Dehghan] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Nosrat St,Tohid Sq, Tehran, Iran","Esmaeili, M (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Nosrat St,Tohid Sq, Tehran, Iran.",,"nayeri, nahid dehghan/W-6041-2019","nayeri, nahid dehghan/0000-0003-1594-6790",Tehran university,"We received funding from the Tehran university of medical sciences, deputy of researches and technology.",,31,3,3,1,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,2.0,,1067.0,+,,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SU,WOS:000390175400040,,,,,2022-07-14

According to the forecasts by the World Health Organization, the diseases will be the main cause of death in the world by 2020. The most common surgery operation in coronary artery disease is coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and medical follow-up (MFU). Survival of 3VD and severe ventricular heart failure patients in two groups of CABG and MFU was compared. Methodology: A retrospective cohort study on 269 patients between 2009 and 2011 was carried out in Imam Ali Medical Educational Center. The 3VD patients underwent coronary artery angiography and had EF <30% so that CABG was prescribed form them. Male and female constituted 78% and 22% of the study group and average age of the participants was 61.40 +/- 9.07. The patients were categorized in two groups of CABG and MFU. Follow up was carried out until November 2014 to record any case of death. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression were used for data analysis. All the analyses were performed in STATA (12) with sig.= 0.05. Findings: The results showed that despite their clear effects on development of coronary artery problems, the demographic information had no significant effect on clinical outcome of the patients. One month, six months, one year, and three years survival of CABG patients was 96.7%, 95.3%, 94.7%, and 89.8% respectively and these figures for the pharmaceutical medication patients were 97%, 92.5%, 86.3%, and 83.4% respectively. In addition, survival term in MFU and CABG patients was 52.80 +/- 1.64 and 57.15 +/- 1.23 months respectively. The most important factor effective on survival of patients according to Cox regression model was left ventricular EF. Conclusion: The findings indicated that survival rate was significantly related to the type of medical intervention. That is, survival rate of CABG group was higher than that of MFU group. Risk rate of CABG and MFU patients increased considerably after 30 and 20 months respectively.","[Farhadi, Khosro; Shetabi, Hamidreza; Saman, Javad Amini; Karimpour, Hassanali] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Fac Med, Dept Anesthesia, Anesthesia, Kermanshah, Iran; [Eskandari, Soudabeh] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Fac Med, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Biostat, Kermanshah, Iran; [Cheghazardi, Shahrokh] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Fac Med, Cardiovasc Dept, Cardiovasc Dis, Kermanshah, Iran","Eskandari, S (corresponding author), Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Fac Med, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Biostat, Kermanshah, Iran.",s.eskandari@kums.ac.ir,"shetabi, Hamidreza/V-9101-2018; Farhadi, Khosro/B-9729-2018; Karimpour, Hassan Ali/M-9867-2017","shetabi, Hamidreza/0000-0002-5165-8385; ",Research Department of Kermanshah Medical Science University [94250],This study is a part of research plan No. 94250; the author express their gratitude for financial supports by Research Department of Kermanshah Medical Science University.,,11,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,5.0,,2038.0,2042,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YW,WOS:000392283800023,,,,,2022-07-14

Since platelets play a fundamental role in the onset of atherosclerosis and coronary clots, assessment of platelet volume indices (PVI) can be important in the prediction and detection of coronary facts. This research was conducted to compare the Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) between patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and healthy individuals. Materials and methods: The study population in this cross-sectional survey included 36 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 36 healthy individuals whose PVIs were compared with each other. After questioning and recording the demographic data of both groups, their blood samples were taken for testing the platelet indices and the results for the MPV were registered in a questionnaire and analyzed using the SPSS software. Findings: the mean and standard deviation for the platelet volume (PV) in patients with AMI and healthy individuals (control group) were +/- 0.95, 10.01 and +/- 0.29, 9.07, respectively. The mean difference in the PV between the two groups was statistically significant (P.value = 0.000). No significant difference was observed between the MPV and the variables of age and gender. Also, no significant differences were observed between the MPV and risk factors for high blood pressure, diabetes, cigarette smoking and body mass index (BMI). Conclusion: This study showed that the MPV is clinically important and a high level of this index can independently be considered as a prognostic factor for cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.","[Fariba, Farnaz] Univ Hamedan, Farshchian Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Hamadan, Iran; [Fariba, Farnaz; Mahboobian, Farzaneh] Univ Hamedan, Farshchian Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Hamadan, Iran","Fariba, F (corresponding author), Univ Hamedan, Farshchian Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Hamadan, Iran.",farnaz.Fariba@gmail.com,"fariba, farnaz/P-5771-2017","fariba, farnaz/0000-0001-7641-2691",,,,21,1,1,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,2.0,,863.0,866,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SU,WOS:000390175400001,,,,,2022-07-14

This study was performed for evaluating the effect of the chemical compound and antimicrobial activity of Cuminum cyminum seed extract on the inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria in silver carp mince. The extract was extracted from the plant via steam distillation using a Clevenger apparatus. Next, its chemical compound was analyzed using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) instrument. The major compound constituting the Cuminum cyminum extract, was cumin aldehyde (20.27%). The effect of different concentrations of Cuminum cyminum (0%, 0.015%, 0.03%, 09.06%, 0.0% and 0.1%) on the growth behavior of the said bacterium was investigated at 4 degrees C for 21 days. The results showed that the bacteria growth stopped up to 6 days in different concentrations of Cuminum cyminum extract. Also, the effect of Cuminum cyminum extract in controlling the bacterium possessed significant differences (p<0.05). Different concentrations of Cuminum cyminum extract for controlling the growth of the bacterium at the above temperature possessed significant statistical differences compared to the control samples (p<0.05). But low concentrations of the Cuminum cyminum extract (0.015% and 0.03%) did not possess significant differences in inhibiting the growth of the bacterium (p>0.05). Whereas high concentrations of the extract used for inhibiting the growth of the bacteria showed significant statistical differences (p<0.05). Suitable inhibitory effects on the growth of the Staphylococcus aureus in silver carp mince were observed at concentrations of 0.09% and 0.1% of Cuminum cyminum extract. Based on the findings of this research it can be said that the extract of the Cuminum cyminum has strong bactericidal properties and is introduced as a natural food preservative instead of its chemical and industrial variations.","[Faridi, Mehrdad] Univ Zabol, Dept Fisheries, Zabol, Iran; [Rahnama, Mohammad; Eskandani, Majid Alipour] Univ Zabol, Fac Vet Med, Dept Food Hyg, Zabol, Iran","Rahnama, M (corresponding author), Univ Zabol, Fac Vet Med, Dept Food Hyg, Zabol, Iran.",dr_m_rahnama@yahoo.com,,"Saadati, Dariush/0000-0001-9002-1507",,,,21,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,5.0,,1991.0,1994,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YW,WOS:000392283800014,,,,,2022-07-14

The association between PAP and tuberculosis (TB) has been rarely reported. Case presentation: We present the case of a 33 year-old man diagnosed with PAP and complicated with pulmonary TB. The suspicion of PAP was based on chest computed tomography with  crazy-paving pattern, and the diagnosis was sustained by eosinophilic PAS (Periodic acid-Schiff) positive lipoproteinaceous material in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Two procedures of wholelung therapeutic lavage were performed with good clinical results. Three years after PAP diagnosis, the patient was diagnosed with TB (bronchial aspirate smears and culture were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Conclusion: Pulmonary TB may occur as a complication in an idiopathic PAP due to reduced phagocytic and chemotaxis capacity of alveolar macrophages or as a possible nosocomial Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission by periodic bronchoscopy exams and washings.","[Fildan, Ariadna Petronela; Tofolean, Doina] Ovidius Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Constanta, Romania; [Toma, Claudia Lucia] Carol Davila Univ Med & Pharm, Sos Viilor 90,Sect 5, Bucharest 050159, Romania; [Toma, Claudia Lucia; Dantes, Elena] Marius Nasta Inst Pneumol, Sos Viilor 90,Sect 5, Bucharest 050159, Romania; [Balteanu, Mara] Ovidius Univ, Dept Pneumophtysiol, Fac Med, Constanta, Romania","Toma, CL (corresponding author), Carol Davila Univ Med & Pharm, Sos Viilor 90,Sect 5, Bucharest 050159, Romania.;Toma, CL (corresponding author), Marius Nasta Inst Pneumol, Sos Viilor 90,Sect 5, Bucharest 050159, Romania.",,"Toma, Claudia/AAS-3064-2021; tofolean, doina/AAA-4400-2019; Dantes, Elena/AAC-9802-2020; fildan, ariadna petronela/H-8677-2017","tofolean, doina/0000-0003-4057-348X; fildan, ariadna petronela/0000-0002-5899-4904",,,,24,2,2,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_136,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000007,,,,,2022-07-14

In addition; due to the anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties of the propolis; its positive properties can be combined with the chewing gum's characteristics when using propolis as a component of chewing gum in order to improve the oral hygiene indices. This study evaluated the effects of biologic chewing gum enriched by propolis on the clinical periodontal indices. Materials an methods: In this double-blind clinical trial; 20 eligible volunteers were selected and used Propolis-contained or propolis-free chewing gums (5 sticks daily for 20 minutes after main meals) for 3 days with two weeks wash-out time. In the third period; the participants did not used any chewing gum. They were asked not to use other chewing gums or other oral hygiene habits in the study periods. The routine oral hygiene habits were followed in the wash-out period. Plaque (4) and gingival (7) indices were measured before and after using chewing gums and the data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance in the 3 groups. The paired comparisons were done by Schaeffer test. Results: Following the consumption of propolis gum, the mean total gingival indices (13/0); gingival index of lingual surface of the teeth (07/0); buccal surfaces of the teeth (19/0); maxilla (11/0); mandible (16/0), was reduced (0001 / 0p <) compared to values seen before taking the gum, while the values of the two groups; one consuming no gum and the other using propolis-free gum, increased. On the other hand, the increase in plaque index in the period without gum was significantly more than the periods of chewing gum containing proposes and proposes-free gum but the difference between the two types of chewing gum were not significant. Conclusion: Together with the positive effects of the proposes-contained chewing gum in the improvement of gingival index and its ability to prevent an increase in plaques; the gum can be used as an adjunctive method to improve oral hygiene level in the eligible individuals.","[Ghaibie, Namatollah] Qazvin Univ Med Sci, Dept Biotechnol, Biotechnol, Qazvin, Iran; [Hamissi, Jalaleddin H.] Qazvin Univ Med Sci, Coll Dent, Periodont & Dent Caries Prevent Res Ctr, Qazvin, Iran; [Rahmani, Yaser] Qazvin Univ Med Sci, Periodont & Dent Caries Prevent Res Ctr, Shaheid Bahonar Blvd, Qazvin, Iran","Hamissi, JH (corresponding author), Qazvin Univ Med Sci, Periodont & Dent Caries Prevent Res Ctr, Shaheid Bahonar Blvd, Qazvin, Iran.",jhamis-si@qums.ac.ir,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,4.0,,1477.0,1481,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YQ,WOS:000392283200028,,,,,2022-07-14

Art and literature can be used as therapies and medications, as an excellent way of expressing existential distress that, in most cases, requires a symbolic and evocative language. The pain cannot be contained in a definition but rather in a story. So the truth of medical science needs another truth, one that includes the whole person, her psyche and her physicality. The theme of death and suicide concerns the essential questions of human life, issues which statistics, clinical and experimental researches do not address. The art and literature lay bare what a person feels, allowing immediate access to his experience. They can be a response to the suffering and be salvation and medicine, place of disclosure of the human labour on the disease, be it physical, psychological or existential. The modern age is dominated by a medical approach that explains the suicide as a result of a pathological derangement. For Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), suicide was the product of a mental illness. The author's aim is to underline how the artistic-literary language is a privileged instrument to study mankind's mood and existential status.","[Giardina, Simona] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore A Gemelli, Fac Med & Chirurg, Ist Bioet & Med Humanities, Rome, Italy; [Montinari, Maria Rosa] Univ Salento, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Biol & Ambientali, Lecce, Italy","Giardina, S (corresponding author), Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore A Gemelli, Fac Med & Chirurg, Ist Bioet & Med Humanities, Rome, Italy.",,,,,,,46,2,2,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1739.0,1748,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_157,,10,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300001,,,,,2022-07-14

However, the relationship between atherosclerosis and VAT has not yet been adequately studied in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to assess the relationship among VAT, adipokines, and atherosclerosis in patients with CKD. Materials and methods: 45 healthy control, 53 predialysis patients, and 52 hemodialysis patients have been enrolled in the study. Intima media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery, and VAT measurements were evaluated via ultrasonography. Results: IMT (p:0.002), VAT (p:0.021), adiponectin (p<0.001) and pentraxin-3 (p:0.003) were higher in predialysis patients than healthy controls. The values of IMT (p<0.001), VAT (p:0.0014), adiponectin (p:0.005), pentraxin-3 (p: <0.001), C reactive protein (CRP) (p:0.009), triglyceride (p: <0.001) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) (p<0.001), were higher in hemodialysis patients than healthy controls. VAT was positively correlated with CRP(r: 0, 23 p: 0.005), IMT (r: 0.347 p<0.001), body mass index (BMI) (r: 0.33 p<0.001), and negatively correlated with creatinine clearance (R: -0.245 p: 0.003). VAT is independently related with adiponectin (beta:-0.213 p: 0.008), BMI (beta:0.369, P<0.001), and CRP (beta:0.164, P:0.032) in multiple regression analysis. IMT was positively correlated with VAT (r: 0.347 p<0.001), CRP (r: 0.186 p:0.022), age (r: 0.333 p<0.001), BMI (r: 0.444 p<0.001) in all participants. Conclusion: These findings show that VAT is a strong risk factor for atherosclerosis in patients with CKD. However IMT was not correlated with adiponectin, pentraxin-3, and leptin in patients with CKD. Also sonographic measurement of VAT could be useful to stratify the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD.","[Guclu, Aydin] Ahi EvranUniv, Dept Nephrol, Sch Med, Kirsehir, Turkey; [Dursun, Belda] PamukkaleUniv, Dept Nephrol, Sch Med, Denizli, Turkey; [Rota, Simin; Yaman, Fatih] PamukkaleUniv, Dept Biochem, Sch Med, Denizli, Turkey; [Rota, Simin; Yaman, Fatih] PamukkaleUniv, Dept Radiol, Sch Med, Denizli, Turkey","Guclu, A (corresponding author), Ahi EvranUniv, Dept Nephrol, Sch Med, Kirsehir, Turkey.",,"Rota, Simin/AAK-4032-2021; Güçlü, Aydın/AAK-4817-2020","Rota, Simin/0000-0003-3406-3483; ",Pamukkale University Scientific Research Projects Unit [2011TPF019],This study was supported by the Pamukkale University Scientific Research Projects Unit (Project Number 2011TPF019).,,44,1,1,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1843.0,1849,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_172,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300016,,,,,2022-07-14

We aimed to assess relationship between paraspinal muscle thickness and bone mineral den shy in postmenopausal women. Materials and methods: Overall, 95 postmenopausal women were included into the study. Back pain was assessed by using Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the lumbar spine and femoral neck. Postmenopausal women were classified into 3 groups as osteopenia, osteoporosis and normal BMD according to WHO. Quality of life was assessed by using Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO-41). Paraspinal muscle thickness was measured from 4 cm lateral to midline by sonography at the level of the 10th thoracic spine. Results: No significant difference was detected between groups regarding duration of weekly exercises, back pain (NRS) and QUALEFFO values (p>0.05). In the osteoporosis group, mean muscle thickness was found to be lower in both right and left side when compared to those in osteopenia and normal BMD group (p<0.01).

The association between vitamin D insufficiency and coronary artery disease, heart failure and hypertension were well demonstrated. Nevertheless the impact of vitamin D insufficiency on arrhythmia remains unclear. Materials and methods: Low vitamin D and control groups consisted of 74 and 80 patients respectively. Parameters of arrhythmia including QT and P wave dispersion, SDNN, SDNN-index, pNN50, RMSSD, HF and LF as well as the number of atrial pre-systole, atrial pair; supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular pre-systole, ventricular pair, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, sustained ventricular tachycardia were compared between the patients with vitamin D insufficiency and controls. Results: Maximum QTc, minimumQTc, QTc dispersion, maximum p wave, minimum p wave, p wave dispersion, SDNN, SDNN index, RMSSD, pNN50, HF and LF values were found to be similar between low vitamin D and control groups (p>0,05). Furthermore there was not a significant difference in the number of atrial pre-systole, atrial pair, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular pre-systole, ventricular pail; non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and sustained ventricular tachycardia (p>0,05). Additionally, serum vitamin D levels were not found to be correlated with QTc dispersion and SDNN (r=-0,010, p=0,933 and r=-0,034, p=0,777 respectively). Conclusion: Serum vitamin D levels do not have any impact on the current arrhythmic status and the risk of developing arrhythmia. Beside the questioned value of vitamin D in general cardiovascular outcomes, arrhythmia is unlikely to be a component of the possible effects of vitamin D insufficiency on cardiovascular system.","[Gunaydin, Zeki Yuksel; Bektas, Osman] Ordu Univ, Dept Cardiol, Ordu, Turkey; [Vural, Asli; Karagov, Ahmet] Giresun Univ, Dept Cardiol, Giresun, Turkey; [Celik, Abdullah] Giresun Univ, Dept Cardiovasc Surg, Giresun, Turkey; [Semerci, Tuna] Giresun Univ, Dept Biochem, Giresun, Turkey; [Kara, Hakan] Private Ada Hosp, Dept Cardiovasc Surg, Giresun, Turkey; [Avci, Esin] Giresun Univ, Dept Stat, Giresun, Turkey","Karagov, A (corresponding author), Giresun Univ, Mumcular St, TR-28200 Giresun, Turkey.",,"AVCI, Esin/AAO-2917-2021; Semerci, Tuna/AAO-3679-2020; AVCI, Esin/AAR-7294-2021","AVCI, Esin/0000-0002-9173-0142",,,,30,1,1,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,143.0,149,,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700022,,,,,2022-07-14

Platelet activation might be related with the pathophysiology of Behcet's disease (BD) since this disease is also prone to inflammation and thrombosis. We aimed to determine whether MPV can be used as a marker for BD in disease activation and severity. Materials and methods: The data of 33 BD patients during the active and the inactive periods of the disease were collected retrospectively, and the results were then compared with 35 recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) patients and 60 healthy controls who were age- and gender-matched. If at least two clinical findings were present, BD was considered to be active. Results: In the active period of BD, the MPV levels (8,6 fL) were slightly higher than those in RAS (8,4 fL) and control groups (8,4 fL) (p=0,148), however, the MPV levels of active period (8.66 fL) were significantly higher than the inactive period (83 fL), (p=0.007). Moreover, 8 BD patients with vascular event history had significantly higher levels of MPV during active (9,3 fL) than inactive period (7,3 fL) of the disease (p=0,012). Conclusion: In conclusion, elevation of MPV levels should be considered for each patient individually, and during follow-ups MPV measurements can be valuable to determine disease activity. Additionally, an elevation in MPV could alarm clinician as BD is getting activated and that there might be an increased risk of vascular involvement with BD.","[Gunduz, Ozge; Gurler, Aysel; Erdogan, Fatma G.] Ufuk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Dermatol, Dermatol, TR-06520 Ankara, Turkey; [Ayanoglu, Burcu T.] Aksaray State Hosp, Dept Dermatol, Aksaray, Turkey; [Alhan, Aslihan] Ufuk Univ, Fac Arts & Sci, Dept Stat, Stat, TR-06520 Ankara, Turkey","Gunduz, O (corresponding author), Ufuk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Dermatol, TR-06520 Ankara, Turkey.",,,"Gunduz, Ozge/0000-0001-8541-9246",,,,21,2,2,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,805.0,809,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_94,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400023,,,,,2022-07-14

Material and method: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of a total 120 patients underwent overnight polysomnography test. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to apnea hypopnea index (AHI) values (< 5/h, 5-15/h, 15-30/h, and > 30/h). The frontal planar QRS/T angle was defined as absolute difference between the frontal QRS wave axis and T-wave axis on resting 12-lead surface electrocardiography (ECG). Results: The average frontal planar QRS-T angle of all participants was 42.79 +/- 38.75 degrees. The frontal planar QRS-T angle is increased with the severity of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and significantly highest in severe OSAS group (AHI >30/h) (p<0.001). In post hoc analysis, we found statistically significant differences as regard mean frontal planar QRS-T angle between normal (AHI 0-5/h) and severe OSAS (AHI > 30/h) (p = 0.002), and between mild OSAS (AHI 5-15/h) and severe OSAS (AHI > 30/h) (p = 0.002). Age, male sex, left ventricular ejection fraction and obstructive apnea index showed sigriOcant association with frontal planar QRS/T angle in multivariate linear regression analysis (for all, p < 0.005). Conclusion: The frontal planar QRS/T angle is significantly widened in patients with newly diagnosed OSAS compared with controls and increased by the severity of the disease determined by AHI. This finding might help the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmic susceptibility in OSAS patients.","[Gungor, Mutlu; Polat, Alper Tolga; Dincer, Hazim] Bayindir Hosp, Cardiol Clin, Ankara, Turkey; [Celik, Murat; Gokoglan, Yalcin; Yildirim, Erkan; Yuksel, Uygar Cagdas; Yasar, Salim; Gursoy, Erol; Koklu, Mustafa] Gulhane Mil Med Acad, Dept Cardiol, Ankara, Turkey; [Ozeke, Ozcan] Yuksek Ihtisas Heart Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Ankara, Turkey; Aksaz Mil Hosp, Serv Cardiol, Mugla, Turkey; [Dogan, Deniz] Gulhane Mil Med Acad, Dept Pulm Med, Ankara, Turkey","Celik, M (corresponding author), Gulhane Mil Med Acad, Dept Cardiol, Cardiol, TR-06018 Etlik, Turkey.",,"Özeke, Özcan/N-1871-2015; Özeke, Özcan/AAS-8730-2020; yuksel, uygar cagdas/AAA-5958-2021","Özeke, Özcan/0000-0002-4770-8159; Özeke, Özcan/0000-0002-4770-8159; ",,,,43,1,1,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,699.0,705,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_77,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400006,,,,,2022-07-14

The aim of this study was to determine whether PACTOIR predict the thrombolytic therapy in the treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE). Materials and methods: This retrospective study was conducted by reviewing charts of 52 patients (aged >= 18 years) who were admitted to our emergency department (ED) with initial diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and confirmed diagnosis of PE by Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CPTA). The patients were divided into two groups as follows: Group 1 (n=14) consisted of the patients who received thrombolytic therapy and Group 2 (n=38) consisted of the patients who did not receive thrombolytic therapy. PACTOIR was calculated in both groups to estimate thrombus load. We evaluated the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy by comparing the levels of D-dieter and Troponin I. Results: Mean value for PACTOIR, D-dimer and Troponin I levels were 56.4 (%), 6.21 (mg/L) and 0.35 (mu g-IL) in Group 1 whereas they were 20.46 (%), 220 (mg/L) and 0.11 (mu g/L) in Group 2, respectively. Significant difference was detected between Group 1 and Group 2 (p<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity values were calculated as 92.9% and 89.5% for PACTOIR, whereas they were 85.7% and 78.9% for D-dimer, respectively. These values were found to be 78.6% and 65.8% for Troponin I, respectively. Conclusion: Based on our results, sensitivity to show PE severity and to determine thrombolytic therapy was significant when compared to D-dimer and Troponin I. In addition, we concluded that PACTOIR is the parameter with greatest sensitivity in determining the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy.","[Guzel, Murat; Atay, Erdi] Samsun Training & Res Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Samsun, Turkey; [Soylu, Aysegul Idil] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Radiol, Samsun, Turkey; [Salt, Omer] Trakya Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Edirne, Turkey; [Erenler, Ali Kemal] Hitit Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Corum, Turkey; [Tomak, Leman] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Med Biostat, Samsun, Turkey; [Aksu, Esra Arslan] Samsun Training & Res Hosp, Dept Chest Dis, Samsun, Turkey; [Baydin, Ahmet] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Samsun, Turkey","Guzel, M (corresponding author), Samsun Training & Res Hosp, Baris Bulvari Kadikoy Mahallesi 199, Ilkadim Samsun, Turkey.",,"güzel, murat/Q-3326-2016; Erenler, Ali Kemal/AAA-2995-2020; BAYDIN, AHMET/AAG-4188-2019","BAYDIN, AHMET/0000-0003-4987-0878",,,,21,0,0,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,811.0,815,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_95,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400024,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: This was a cohort study on 72 pre-menopausal patients with breast cancer selected by convenient sampling from public and private hematology and medical oncology clinics in Zahedan during 2012-2015. The bone density was measured before chemotherapy and 6 months after receiving chemotherapy by DXA in femur and vertebrae L1-L4. The results of pre-chemotherapy bone density were compared to post-chemotherapy results (after 6 months) using t-paired test. Results: Findings showed that the lumbar BMD was 0.97 +/- 0.11 before receiving chemotherapy and 0.92 +/- 0.11 after 6 months of chemotherapy, which indicates a significant difference (P = < 0.001). moreover, femoral BMD was 0.88 +/- 0.31 before receiving chemotherapy and 0.82 +/- 0.12 after 6 months of chemotherapy, which indicates a significant difference (P= < 0.001). Discussion and Conclusion: In this study, bone density generally decreased in the femoral neck and lumbar spine in patients with breast cancer treated with chemotherapy. Furthermore, a relationship was found between the received chemotherapy regimen and the reduced chance of developing bone density.","[Hashemi, Seyed Mehdi] Zahedan Univ Med Sci, Part Ali Ebne Abitaleb Hosp, Internal Ward Hematol & Med Oncol, Hematol & Med Oncol, Zahedan, Iran; [Zakeri, Zahra] Shahid Behshti Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Rheumatol, Tehran, Iran; [Sameni, Farzaneh Khadem] Islamic Azad Univ, Zahedan Branch, Fac Med, Tehran, Iran; [Allahyari, Abolghasem] Univ Mashhad, Sch Med, Dept Med, Hematol & Med Oncol, Mashhad, Iran; [Ansari-Moghaddam, Alireza] Zahedan Univ Med Sci, Hlth Promot Res Ctr, Zahedan, Iran","Sameni, FK (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Zahedan Branch, Fac Med, Tehran, Iran.",,"Ansari-Moghaddam, Alireza/J-2406-2017; hashemi, seyed mehdi/Q-8354-2017; alahyari, abolghasem/AFU-6270-2022","Ansari-Moghaddam, Alireza/0000-0002-3267-7193; hashemi, seyed mehdi/0000-0003-4948-9639; ",,,,24,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,2.0,,1093.0,1098,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SU,WOS:000390175400044,,,,,2022-07-14

Two nosocomial transmissions were reported from two hospitals of Mashhad in the last 4 years. The aim of this study was to assess the role of preventive measures on disease prevention among Health Care Workers (HCWs) who are in contact with confirmed CCHF cases. Methodology: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in the infectious ward of a referral hospital in North-East of Iran. During 2009 to 2012 about 45 confirmed cases of CCHF were admitted to this hospital. 44 HCWs who had contact with these cases were included in this study. Participants were questioned regarding taking preventive measures including the use of gloves, gown, shield, mask, and shoe cover. Sera samples were also collected 2 months after the last CCHF case admission and were checked for anti-CCHF IgM and IgG. Results: All study participants had a history of close contact with confirmed CCHF patients. The contacts were due to daily visits and examination, suction of secretions, intubation, taking blood samples, administering drugs, contact with the patients' clothes, and performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The adherence rate to universal precautions was fairly good and anti-CCHF IgM and IgG results were negative in all subjects. Conclusion: The findings of our study further prove that protective measures are highly effective in preventing CCHF transmission in HCWs.","[Hassaniazad, Mehdi] Hormozgan Univ Med Sci, Infect Dis Res Ctr Infect & Trop, Bandar Abbas, Iran; [Bojdi, Amin; Abedi, Farshid] Mashhad Univ Med Sci, Infect Dis, Mashhad, Iran; [Chinikar, Sadegh] Inst Iran, VHFs Lab, Natl Ref Lab, Mashhad, Iran; [Bazaz, Seyed Mojtaba Mousavi] Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Dept Med Educ, Mashhad, Iran","Abedi, F (corresponding author), Mashhad Univ Med Sci, Infect Dis, Mashhad, Iran.",AbediF@mums.ac.ir,"CHINIKAR, Sadegh/AAH-8155-2019; abedi, farshid/O-3402-2017; Hassaniazad, Mehdi/H-3409-2017","Hassaniazad, Mehdi/0000-0003-3924-2069",,,,16,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,5.0,,2017.0,2020,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YW,WOS:000392283800019,,,,,2022-07-14

Method: this was a cross-sectional study and carried out in the form of descriptive-analytical design on a study population consisting of 100 women who were volunteered for cosmetic surgery and 100 women who were not, in 2016. Random sampling was used in order to select subjects. Due to the nature of the research, the data collection was done through a survey, and to do so, NEO five-factor personality inventory, multidimensional perceived social support, and perceived stress questionnaire was employed. Also, descriptive analysis and t-test were used for one and two independent groups in order to analyze the data. Findings: the analyses indicated that there was no significant statistical relationship between different aspects of personality including neuroticism, extroversion, and introversion, desired for new experiences, and loyalty between volunteers and non-volunteers. Moreover, volunteers and non-volunteers did not experience the same perceived social support from their family and there was not any significant relationship between them. However, the social support received from friends and others was more in the case of volunteers for cosmetic surgery and it was statistically significant. According to the results, perceived stress was the same between volunteers and non-volunteers, i. e. there was no significant statistical difference between them. Conclusion: The results showed that the average score of non-volunteers was higher than volunteers in different personality aspects, while among different aspects of personality, the average score of agreeableness was different between volunteers and nonvolunteers. The perceived social support from friends and others was more significant among volunteers but perceived stress was the same in both groups and it was not statistically significant.","[Heidarian, Masoumeh] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Psychol, Ilam Branch, Clin Psychol, Ilam, Iran; [Mohammadian, Fatholah] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Psychol, Ilam Branch, Hlth Psychol, Ilam, Iran","Heidarian, M (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Psychol, Ilam Branch, Clin Psychol, Ilam, Iran.",heidarian.masumeh@yahoo.com,,,,,,7,0,0,0,9,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,5.0,,2043.0,2046,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YW,WOS:000392283800024,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: In this study, 12 nude mice models bearing human lung cancer xenografts were built by injecting A549 lung cancer cell. The targeting NET-I, VEGF siRNA and DGT siRNA embedded by cationic liposome were injected to the xenograft tumor when its volume reached to 100mm3. The expressions of NET-1 and VEGF gene in xenograft tumor were detected by immunohistochemistry. Additionally, proliferation and microvessel density of xenograft tumors were evaluated by detecting the expression of Ki-67 and CD34 respectively. Results: Nude mice models bearing xenograft tumor were successfully built. In dual siRNA group, compared with single NET-1 or VEGF siRNAs group, the volume of xenograft tumor was smaller; the expressions of NET-1 and VEGF was lower; the expression of Ki-67 and CD34 was lower as well (P<0.05).

Sensitivity and specificity of parameters such as CRP (C-reactive protein), erythrocyte sedimentation rate and WBC (white blood cell), which are among the classical markers of systemic inflammation, were reported to have limited benefit in patients with these types of bacterial infections. PCT (procalcitonin) has been a focus of interest as a specific and early marker in systemic inflammation, sepsis and infections especially in recent years. In this study, we aimed to evaluate potential usability of PCT in distinction of systemic and localized bacterial infections in patients who are followed up in ICU and to compare CRP, WBC and MPV (mean platelet volume) values in patients with systemic and localized bacterial infections. Materials and methods: Totally 52 patients who were followed in Adult ICU of our hospital were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of patients with growth in blood culture and systemic bacterial infection clinic. Group 2 consisted of patients with growth in phlegm, tracheal aspirate, wound and urine culture without growth in blood culture. Age, gender growth region and growing microorganisms, simultaneously checked CRP, PCT, WBC, MPV values were recorded in follow-up form. Results: The study showed that PCT value was significantly high in systemic infections, while other parameters did not show a significant difference between the two groups. Furthermore, Acinetobacter baumannii was found to be the most common agent. Conclusion: Our study suggests that PCT value has a more valuable potential than other standard infection parameters in distinction of systemic infection and localized bacterial infection in patients who are followed in ICU. However, we believe that more comprehensive studies with a larger sampling can guide the clinicians for early diagnosis and treatment.","[Inci, A.] Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Training & Res Hosp, Dept Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Demiraran, Y.] Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Training & Res Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol & Intens Care, Istanbul, Turkey; [Erus, S.; Yaprak, U.] Koc Univ, Fac Med, Dept Thorac Surg, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ocak, T.; Akman, C.; Basturk, M.; Kalafat, U.

Here we describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics and response to treatment of patients with oropharyngeal tularemia caused by F. tularensis. subsp.holarctica. Materials and methods: Datawere collected retrospectively from patients' files. Serum, throat swabs and lymph node aspirates were obtained from suspected patients. The diagnosis was confirmed by a single titer of IgG >= 1 : 160 or a seroconversion or detection of F.tularensis nucleic acid or isolation of it in a clinical specimen. Results: All the patients had cervical or submandibular lymphadenopathy and malaise at admission. Lymphadenopathy was the single finding in 86.36% of patients. Microagglutination test was positive for F.tularensis subsp. holarcticain 95.45% of patients, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of drained material was positive in 22.72% of patients but cultures were negative. Treatment delay and therapeutic failure was seen in 90.90% and 45.45% of the patients respectively. We found statistically significant relationship between treatment delay and therapeutic failure (P= 0.0005). Discussion: Tularemia should be suspected whenever severe pharyngitis or tonsillitis and lymphadenophaties is unresponsive to beta-lactam or macrolides in an endemic area. As treatment delay is an important risk factor for therapeutic failure, treatment should be started as soon as tularemia is suspected.","[Iskender, Gulsen; Ceken, Sabahat; Ogan, Mustafa Cihat; Ertek, Mustafa] Ankara Oncol Educ & Res Hosp, Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol Clin, Ankara, Turkey; [Gedik, Habip] Dr Sadi Konuk Educ & Res Hosp, Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol Clin, Istanbul, Turkey; [Kilic, Selcuk] Publ Hlth Inst Turkey, Natl Tularemia Reference Lab, Ankara, Turkey","Iskender, G (corresponding author), Ankara Oncol Educ & Res Hosp, Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol Clin, Vatan St 56, Yenimahalle Ankara, Turkey.",,"ceken, sabahat/ABA-5328-2020; Gedik, Habip/ABI-3946-2020","Gedik, Habip/0000-0002-8406-2254",,,,34,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,391.0,397,,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000019,,,,,2022-07-14

Lack of ripening of the cervix is considered to be one of the problems of delivery. Thus, the present research was designed to determine the effect of oral evening primrose capsules on the ripening of cervix in nulliparous women. Materials and methods: This research has been conducted with the triple-blind randomized trial method on 80 nulliparous women in the 40th week of pregnancy (6th day + 40 weeks) visiting the prenatal clinic Prenatal clinic Shahid Akbarabadi educational and medical center of Iran University of Medical Sciences in 2015. Samples were divided into two equal groups of medicine and placebo with the randomized allocation method. Each of the participants took a bottle containing 14 1000mg oral evening primrose capsules (2 capsules per day, each 12 twelve hours for a week) or the placebo containing 14 1000mg oral capsules of paraffin in similar bottles. Data collecting tools include: demographic specifications questionnaire and the form of the records of the examinations. Data was analyzed through statistical tests and SPSS software version 16 using descriptive inferential statistic. Findings: Similarity of the two groups in terms of individual specifications and Bishop Score before the intervention were reviewed in the two groups and no significant statistical difference was seen between the two groups. The mean of the Bishop score for those who had taken 10 or more capsules after the intervention did not show a statistically significant difference (p=0.110). Conclusion: Consumption of evening primrose did not show a considerable improvement in the score. It is recommended to do more comparative studies in this field in later weeks of pregnancy due to the conflicts of the studies.","[Kalati, Mahnaz] Iran Univ Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery Fac, Int Campus, Tehran, Iran; [Kashanian, Maryam] Iran Univ Med Sci, Dept Obstet & Midwifery, Tehran, Iran; [Naseri, Mohsen] Shahed Univ, Tradit Med, Tehran, Iran; [Naseri, Mohsen] Shahed Univ, Res Ctr Randomized Trial Tradit Med, Tehran, Iran; [Haghani, Hamid] Univ Med Sci, Fac Management, Biostat, Tehran, Iran","Kalati, M (corresponding author), Iran Univ Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery Fac, Int Campus, Tehran, Iran.",mahnazkalati77@yahoo.com,"jahdi, fereshteh/I-3132-2017","jahdi, fereshteh/0000-0002-7018-4744",Iran University of Medical Sciences of International Pardis,"Authors sincerely thank the respected deputy of research unit of Iran University of Medical Sciences of International Pardis for their financial support.

Therefore, creating the opportunities of independence through interacting with environment and other people and gaining sustainable mental energy can empower this defect and turn pregnancy into something pleasant. As a result, present study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of empowerment-based education on empowerment and anxiety in nulliparous women. Methods: This clinical trial survey was performed on 70 nulliparous women of 20-24 weeks. Subjects were divided into two control and experimental groups of 35 members through random sampling. Both groups completed the demographic questionnaire, Pregnant Women Empowerment questionnaire, and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) before intervention. Pregnant Women Empowerment questionnaire and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was completed again immediately and eight weeks after intervention by both groups. Data were analyzed by t test and Fisher's exact test through SPSS version 16. Significance level of 0.05 was considered. Results: There were no significant differences between control and experimental groups, with whole demographic variables. The results showed that the mean and standard deviation of anxiety in two groups of experimental and control before intervention were 16.78 +/- 90.91 and 16.29 +/- 89.14 which implies no significant difference (P>0.05); however, post-intervention data analysis immediately and eight weeks after intervention showed a significant difference between two groups (P<0001). Mean and standard deviation of empowerment before the intervention in control and experimental groups, respectively, were 6.83 +/- 74.77 and 7.76 +/- 76.80 in which no statistically significant difference between two groups was observed (P>0.05); however, post-intervention data analysis immediately and eight weeks after intervention showed a significant difference between two groups. (P<0001) Conclusion: Empowerment-based education reduces the level of anxiety and increases empowerment of women during pregnancy; since this method is cheap, simple, and risk-free, it is highly recommended for nulliparous women.","[Jahdi, Fereshteh] Iran Univ Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Dept Midwifery, Tehran, Iran; [Koohsarian, Zahara] Iran Univ Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, ValiAsr Sq,Vanak Sq,St Sha, Tehran, Iran; [Rasoulian, Maryam] Iran Univ Med Sci, Tehran Psychiat Inst, Mental Hlth Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Montazeri, Ali] ACECR, Inst Hlth Sci Res, Dept Mental Hlth, Tehran, Iran","Koohsarian, Z (corresponding author), Iran Univ Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, ValiAsr Sq,Vanak Sq,St Sha, Tehran, Iran.",zahrakooh1369@gmail.com,"Montazeri, Ali/C-9276-2009; jahdi, fereshteh/I-3132-2017; Koohsarian, Zahra/AAT-3100-2021","Montazeri, Ali/0000-0002-5198-9539; jahdi, fereshteh/0000-0002-7018-4744; Koohsarian, Zahra/0000-0001-8871-3985",,,,42,0,0,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,4.0,,1281.0,1287,,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YQ,WOS:000392283200014,,,,,2022-07-14

In recent years, trans-atrial, trans-pulmonary, and primary repair have gained acceptance in younger patients. Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the outcomes of surgeries performed for patients with TOF in Kermanshah, Iran in mid-and long-term follow-ups. Methods: A total of 92 patients with TOF who underwent surgery between 1995 and 2010 were included. The required data were extracted from their medical records. Mean age of the subjects at the time of surgery was 7.3 years. Thirty-four patients (36.95%) were younger than five years, 41 subjects (45.05%) aged between five and ten years old and 17 patients (18.47%) were older than 10 years. Results: Thirty-seven patients required shunt placement before the corrective surgery, mainly due to complex anatomy of the defect. Complete repair surgery was achieved via trans-atrial approach in 25 patients and via transatrial-transpulmonary approach in 30 patients. In very young patients, due to stenosis of pulmonary valve, trans-annular patch was required. All patients after receiving treatments had sinus rhythm. Right bundle branch block (RBBB) was seen in 91 patients after surgery. Mean hospitalization duration was 12 days. Twenty-six patients (29.3%) required re-operation which included pulmonary insufficiency (14 cases), tricuspid regurgitation (6 cases), pulmonary stenosis (3 cases), and ventricular septal defect in 2 subjects. There were early death in 13 subjects and late death in seven patients. Conclusion: Surgical correction of TOF at younger age did not raise mortality rate.

Therefore, screening for cervical cancer is considered an effective method in early diagnosis and treatment of this condition. Here, we studied screening tests results to determine the frequency of abnormal cervical cytologic findings. Methods: This study had two phases. The first phase was conducted from March 2007 to March 2008 (400 subjects). The second phase lasted from March 2011 to March 2012 (208 subjects). All infertile women (either primary causes or secondary ones) who presented to our university infertility clinic to receive treatments were included. Results: Cervical cytology reports were unsatisfactory in 10 subjects (1.7%) and abnormal in three patients (0.5%). Most cases whose reports were unsatisfactory were documented in the first phase of the study (i.e., 9 patients, 90%). Conclusion: Cervical screening with Pap smear enables early diagnosis and management of cervical abnormalities and consequently a decrease in the rate of invasive cervical cancers.

The objective of this study was to investigate sperm preparation with three methods of sperm gradient procedure (P50), bilayer gradient (P 40-80), and swim-up method for IUI in couples with male factor sub fertility(mild form, 5-15 million sperm per mL) or unexplained infertility. Methods: A total number of 153 infertile couples underwent 223 therapeutic cycles. There were 103 couples (68%) with unexplained infertility and 50 couples (32%) with mild male factor sub fertility. Sperm parameters including concentration, morphology, motility, and pregnancy rate were determined in each group before and after sperm preparation. Results: In unexplained infertility group, differences in sperm motility and morphology before and after P 40-80 preparation method were 67.1 (3.8) and 18 (1.1), respectively. This difference was significantly higher compared to the other two methods. The rate of pregnancy was also significantly higher (18%) in P 40-80 group compared to the other groups.

To analyze the factors affecting the time span between the first drug-abuse experiences to the first quitting attempt, stepwise regression was run using the SPSS software, version 16. Results: Altogether, the data pertaining to 2652 people referring to 80 treatment centers were analyzed. The age mean was 37.98(+/- 11.18), with men accounting for 97 percent of the population. Findings indicated that the following factors affected the time span between the first drug-abuse experience to the first quitting attempt significantly (p<0.05): age, gender, age in the time of the first abuse, homelessness, hashish consumption, heroin consumption, family history of addiction, and family history of mental disorders. Conclusion: It can be concluded that a large number of personal and social factors affect quitting attempts by drug addicts. To reduce the burden of addiction on the society through treating the addicts, thorough support from the family as well as from the government and the organizations in charge is required.","[Juibari, Toraj Ahmadi; Aghaei, Abbas; MasoudMoradi; Najafi, Farid; Farnia, Vahid] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Subst Abuse Prevent Res Ctr, Kermanshah, Iran; [Lotfi, Bahare; Ghobadi, Khadijeh Najafi] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Imam Khomainiand Mohammad Kermanshahi Hosp, Clin Res Dev Ctr, Epidemiol, Kermanshah, Iran","Aghaei, A (corresponding author), Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Subst Abuse Prevent Res Ctr, Kermanshah, Iran.",aqaei.a@gmail.com,"Moradi, Masoud/AAF-2174-2020; Aghaei, Abbas/N-5121-2019","Moradi, Masoud/0000-0003-2036-5333; Aghaei, Abbas/0000-0001-9612-1250","Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran [91090]","This article is the result of the findings of the research project 91090; that approved and financed by the Vice Chancellor for Research and Technology, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.",,13,1,1,1,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,2.0,,885.0,890,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SU,WOS:000390175400005,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: This study was a longitudinal study to evaluate changes in performance indices of hospitals in Kermanshah province during 2012 to 2015. The data were collected from the emergency ward as the designed list and they have been applied into SPSS software v.16. Method of repeated measures has been utilized to evaluate normal indices and the Friedman nonparametric test has been applied for abnormal indices Results: The results showed that the difference of the index of percentage settled patients within 6 hours and the variations for the index of failed CPR percentage between public and private hospitals were significant. Also there were no significant mean variations of any indices between academic hospitals and non-academic hospitals over time. The average deviation for time of triage level 1 had a significant difference in civilian and military hospitals and lower mean time of triage level 5 was statistically significant in the hospitals of Kermanshah city in comparison with other province's cities. Conclusion: The deviations for the index of settled patient's percentage within 6 hours were significant, and the higher value of this index for winter and spring implies the effect of season on these deviations at present study. The main powers and facilities of emergency ward should be properly managed for winter and spring, because the personnel's working shifts are reduced by the holidays of New Persian Year.","[Juibari, Toraj Ahmadi; Ghobadi, Khadijeh Najafi; Lotfi, Bahare; Shaahmadi, Zahra; Aghaei, Abbas] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Imam Khomaini & Mohammad Kermanshahi Hosp, Kermanshah, Iran; [Kazemi, Mahmoud] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Imam Ali Hosp, Kermanshah, Iran","Aghaei, A (corresponding author), Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Imam Khomaini & Mohammad Kermanshahi Hosp, Kermanshah, Iran.",aqaei.a@gmail.com,"Aghaei, Abbas/N-5121-2019","Aghaei, Abbas/0000-0001-9612-1250",,,,15,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,5.0,,2005.0,2011,,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YW,WOS:000392283800017,,,,,2022-07-14

They may rarely become to giant dimensions and they are called as giant lipomas. Giant lipomas are rare and they may also resemble to malignant soft tissue tumors. In this case they should be differentiated especially from liposarcomas. In this study we evaluated the treatment results of lipomatous tumors (giant lipomas and liposar comas) of the thigh with their clinical, radiological, and histopathological features. Materials and methods: Twelve patients with giant lipomatous tumor on thigh who underwent surgical excision were included to the study. Patients were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) preoperatively. To rule out distant metastasis, thoracic and abdominal computed tomography (CT) were performed. Initially, incisional biopsy was performed, and according to the histopathological results, these giant lipomatous tumors were surgically excised. Results: There were 6 males and 6 females with an average age of 55,6 years. Histopathological examinations revealed the lesions to be giant lipomas in nine patients, and liposarcomas in the remaining three patients. Because of the dimensions or weight of the lipomas, they were accepted as giant lipomas. The heaviest lipoma was 1976 g. After surgical excision patients were followed up with an average of 24,3 months. During the follow up of the patients, local recurrences and distant metastasis were not observed. Conclusion: Giant lipomas are rarely seen tumors. Differential diagnosis of giant lipoma and liposarcoma may cause difficulties. In the presence of suspicion, biopsy should be performed. Surgical treatment modality also should be planned according to the histopathological results. Marginal surgical excision is adequate for giant lipomas, but as wide as possible surgical excision with negative surgical margins should be performed for liposarcomas to reduce the rate of local recurrences.","[Kafadar, Ibrahim H.; Argun, Mahmut; Halici, Mehmet; Karaman, Ibrahim; Oner, Mithat] Erciyes Univ, Fac Med, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, TR-38039 Kayseri, Turkey; [Okten, Turhan] Erciyes Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pathol, Kayseri, Turkey; [Dogan, Serap; Ozturk, Mustafa] Erciyes Univ, Fac Med, Dept Radiol, Kayseri, Turkey","Kafadar, IH (corresponding author), Erciyes Univ, Fac Med, Dept Orthoped & Traumatol, TR-38039 Kayseri, Turkey.",,"Argün, Mahmut/AAP-5003-2021; Karaman, Ibrahim/AAP-4055-2021",,,,,30,0,0,0,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,237.0,242,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700037,,,,,2022-07-14

Recent studies have reported that the monocyte/ high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (MHR) serves as an inflammatory marker. The purpose of this study is to analyze the prognostic value of the MHR in DN patients. Material and methods: The medical records of type 2 DM patients who received follow-up care at the internal medicine clinic were examined, and the data of all patients who had undergone estimation of 24-hour UAE were recorded. These patients were separated into 3 groups on the basis of the UAE levels and the biochemical data and the MHR were compared between the groups. Results: The serum creatinine (p = 0.008), 24-hour UAE (p < 0.001), and MHR (p = 0.005) were all significantly different between the groups. The MHR was positively correlated to the 24-hour UAE (p = 0.007) and negatively correlated to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (p = 0.023).

Deregulation of HGF/cMET system by different biological mechanisms may contribute to the minor development in many types of cancers. Therefore, the present study was performed to investigate clinical significance of serum patterns of both HGF and cMET in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Materials and methods: One hundred and three CRC patients were enrolled in this study. Serum HGF and cMET levels were measured by the solid-phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Age- and sex-matched 30 healthy control patients were included in the analysis. Results: The median age of the patients was 60 years old, range 24 to 84 years. Most of the tumor localization areas were colon (n = 57, 55%). Median follow-up time was 14 months. While thirty-one patients (30 %) experienced disease progression, twenty-three of the remaining patients (22 %) died because of the disease. The estimated 2-year overall (OS) and 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates for the whole patient groups were 70.1 % (95% confidence interval (CI) = 57.2-83.0) and 233 % (95% CI = 82-38.4), respectively. The baseline median serum HGF and cMET levels were significantly higher in metastatic CRC patients than in the healthy control group (p<0.001). Furthermore, worse performance status and metastatic disease were associated with higher serum HGF concentrations all patients with CRC (p=0.03 and p=0.03, respectively). Clinical variables including metastatic disease, greater pathologic tumor status, and colonic site were found to be correlated with higher serum cMET concentrations all patients with CRC (p=0.01, p=0.05, and p=0.04, respectively). A correlation was determined between HGF and cMET levels in metastatic CRC patients (rs=0.286, n=47, and p=0.05), (Spearman's correlation). Our study results did not show a statistically significant serum HGF and cMET concentrations regarding PFS and OS. Conclusion: Serum levels of HGF and cMET may be diagnostic markers in CRC patients. However; their predictive and prognostic values were not determined.","[Karabulut, Mehmet; Alis, Halil; Kones, Osman; Seyit, Hakan] Istanbul Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Gen Surg, Istanbul, Turkey; [Gunaldi, Meral] Istanbul Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Afsar, Cigdem Usul] Istanbul Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Karabulut, Senem; Aykan, Nuri Faruk] Istanbul Univ, Fac Med, Inst Oncol, Dept Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Serilmez, Murat] Istanbul Univ, Fac Med, Inst Oncol, Dept Basic Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey","Karabulut, M (corresponding author), Istanbul Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Gen Surg, Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Afsar, Cigdem Usul/C-3436-2015; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/AAA-6103-2021; Serilmez, Murat/V-6153-2018; karabulut, senem/AAT-3594-2020; Alis, Halil/AAJ-6721-2020; Gunaldi, Meral/Z-1463-2018; Aykan, Nuri Faruk/I-6425-2019; Seyit, Hakan/AAJ-7050-2020","Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639; Serilmez, Murat/0000-0001-8502-2505; Aykan, Nuri Faruk/0000-0002-5472-3218; ",,,,26,1,1,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,179.0,187,,,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700028,,,,,2022-07-14

Macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha [MIP-1 alpha/CC-chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3)] is a small chemotactic protein detected in several kinds of tumor tissue samples and functions as a key regulator of cancer progression. This study aimed to investigate the serum MIP-1 alpha/CCL3 levels in pacreatic adenocarcinoma (PA). Materials and methods: Thirty-three patients with PA were investigated. Serum MIP1-alpha/CCL3 levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Age and sex matched 30 healthy controls were included in the analysis. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 59 years, range 32-84 years; 20 (61%) patients were men. The tumor was located in the head of the pancreas in 21 (63%) patients. The most common metastatic site was the liver in the 23 patients with metastasis (n= 19, 83%). The median follow-up time was 26.0 weeks (range: 1.0-184.0 weeks). At the end of the observation period, thirty-two patients (97%) were dead. Thirty-nine percent of 23 metastatic patients who received palliative chemotherapy (CTx) were CTx-responsive. The median overall survival of all the patients was 41.3 +/- 8.3 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI]= 5-58 weeks). The baseline serum MIP1-alpha/CCL3 levels were significantly higher in patients with PA than in the control group (p< 0.001). Serum MIP1-alpha/CCL3 levels were significantly higher in the older patients(p= 0.03). Conversely, serum MIP1-alpha/CCL3 concentration had no prognostic role on survival (p= 0.68). Conclusion: Serum levels of MIP1-alpha/CCL3 may have a good diagnostic role in PA.

Although alexithymia is more commonly seen in painful rheumatic conditions such as RA, there is limited clinical data about the relations with other psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety and their impact on quality of life. We aimed to assess the level of alexithymia, depression and anxiety and their effects on quality of life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Materials and methods: A hundred forty-eight patients with RA and 100 healthy subjects were included in the study. After physical examination of the patients, Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were performed to determine levels of alexithymia depression and anxiety, respectively. The World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale Abbreviated Version (WHOQoL-BREF) was used to assess the quality of life. Disease Activity Score Calculator for Rheumatoid Arthritis-28 (DAS-28) was performed to evaluate disease activity. Results: The prevalence of alexithymia was 31.1% in patients with RA. Alexithymia was statistically significantly higher in the RA than the control group (p< 0.05). 41.9% (n= 62) of the patients with RA were diagnosed with depression. 20.9% (n= 31) of the patients had severe anxiety symptoms. Although there was no statistically significant difference between alexithymia and depression scores, disease activity scores (p> 0.05) in patient with RA. The anxiety scores were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in patients with RA. RA patients manifested poorer scores in all domains of WHOQoL-BREF than the control subjects (p< 0.05). Conclusion: In this clinical trial it has been demonstrated that regardless of disease activity, alexithymia, symptoms of depression and anxiety are more commonly seen in RA patients that can negatively affect the quality of life. Further studies are needed to confirm this association.","[Karahan, Ali Yavuz] Konya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Konya, Turkey; [Kucuk, Adem] Necmettin Erbakan Univ, Dept Rheumatol, Konya, Turkey; [Balkarli, Ayse] Pamukkale Univ, Dept Rheumatol, Denizli, Turkey; [Kayhan, Fatih] Mevlana Univ, Dept Psychiat, Konya, Turkey; [Ozhan, Nail] Pamukkale Univ, Dept Internal Med, Fac Med, Denizli, Turkey; [Nas, Omer; Gungor, Tayfun; Kucuksen, Sami] Necmettin Erbakan Univ, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Konya, Turkey","Karahan, AY (corresponding author), Konya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Konya, Turkey.",,"karahan, ali yavuz/E-4481-2017","karahan, ali yavuz/0000-0001-8142-913X",,,,47,1,1,0,9,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_149,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000020,,,,,2022-07-14

The objective of this study was to investigate whether the aggregate weighted track and trigger system Early warning score (EWS) can be used as a simple observational tool to identify patients at risk and predict treatment success in a population of patients with dyspnea. Materials and methods: Adult patients who applied to the emergency service with dyspnea complaints and who were taken in for monitoring were included in this prospective and empirical study. Pulse, systolic blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and neurologi-cal status at the time of arrival, 15minutes later and 30 minutes later were used for EWS cal-culation. Patients were divided into four score categories based on their EWS. The patients were compared with regard to hospitalization, discharge and response to the treatment. Results: T91 patients were included in the study. The EWS values of dyspnea patients calculated for the 15th and 30th minutes were observed to be statistically significant as a result of an evaluation with regard to hospitalization and discharge (p= 0.015, p= 0.001). It was determined that the oxygen saturation values measured on the 15th and 30th minutes were important for giving the hospitalization decision (p= 0.048, p= 0.009). Improvement in the physiological parameters measured at the time of arrival, 15minutes later and 30 minutes later were determined to be significant for the evaluation of the response to the treatment. Conclusions: In this study, it was put forth that the difference between the EWS value at the time of arrival, 15minutes later and 30 minutes later is an early indicator for the result and success of the treatment. This can ease making clinical decisions and shorten the time that patients stay at the emergency service by prioritizing risky patients.","[Karakaya, Zeynep; Topal, Fatih Esad; Unluer, Erden Erol; Payza, Umut] KatipCelebi Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Ataturk Training & Res Hosp Izmir, Izmir, Turkey; [Ozdinc, Serife] Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Afyonkarahisa, Turkey; [Korol, Guler] Bahcesehir State Hosp Istanbul, Dept Emergency Med, Istanbul, Turkey","Karakaya, Z (corresponding author), KatipCelebi Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Ataturk Training & Res Hosp Izmir, Izmir, Turkey.",,"Payza, Umut/R-5397-2019","Payza, Umut/0000-0002-5297-1066",,,,23,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_141,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000012,,,,,2022-07-14

Results: VRE were detected in 75 (6.63%) of the 1130 patients screened using the two methods. Resistance gene was determined in 69 (6.1%) patients using RT-PCR and 32 (2.8%) with CCSM. RT-PCR results were negative in 6 patients with VRE growth determined using CCSM. VRE was detected with CCSM in all 26 patients in whom vanA genotype VRE were determined using RT-PCR, but no growth was determined with CCSM in any of the 43 patients in whom vanB genotype VRE were detected. Results obtained in 3 days using CCSM and within 4 hours using RT-PCR. Costs were 58 $ with CCSM and 46 $ with RT-PCR. Conclusion: VRE colonization being detected faster with RT-PCR than CCSM. When the costs in isolation of patients until VRE screening test results emerged were compared, VRE screening with RT-PCR was cost-effective. RT-PCR was markedly superior to CCSM in determining VanB type resistance. Due to the late results from CCSM and its failure to detect VanB type resistance, we think that RT-PCR can be an alternative to CCSM or that the two techniques can usefully be combined depending on the hospital conditions.","[Karakecili, Faruk; Akin, Hicran] Erzincan Univ, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol, Erzincan, Turkey; [Cilo, Burcu Dalyan; Agca, Harun; Sinirtas, Melda; Ozakin, Cuneyt] Uludag Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Bursa, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Emel; Akalin, Halis] Uludag Univ, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol, Bursa, Turkey","Karakecili, F (corresponding author), Erzincan Univ, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol, Erzincan, Turkey.",,"AGCA, HARUN/AAH-4027-2021; Özakın, Cüneyt/AAG-8392-2021; Akalin, Halis/AAU-8952-2020","Özakın, Cüneyt/0000-0001-5428-3630; Yilmaz, Emel/0000-0002-3894-1231; AGCA, HARUN/0000-0002-2651-2034",,,,21,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,87.0,91,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700013,,,,,2022-07-14

The aim of this research is to compare AP-PCR with PFGE, which is known as the gold standard method, and to determine if AP-PCR is suitable for use in outbreaks. Materials and methods: Between 2001 and 2009, 664 isolated vancomycin resistant enterococcus (VRE) strains were determined at the Bacteriology Laboratory, Department of Medical Microbiology. During nine years study 5 peak periods were identified. In each peak period of 3 months, 83 VRE strains were selected from the 664 for this research. For all isolates a comparison of AP-PCR and PFGE using 83 VRE strains was performed. Results: Enterococcus faecium was found to be the dominant species in all VRE isolated from hospitalized patients. 83 strains of E. faecium were included in the study, which were isolated from 5 different possible epidemic periods over 9 years. 15 different clonal strains were collected using the AP-PCR method and 11 using PFGE. Conclusion: AP-PCR was found to be repeatable and had a better separation power than PFGE. FPGE though is a simpler, cheaper and faster method and can be used for VRE epidemics as an alternative method. In future epidemiological outbreaks the comparative molecular methods are more reliable than a single method.","[Karakecili, Faruk; Akalin, Halis] Erzincan Univ, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol, Erzincan, Turkey; [Cilo, Burcu Dalyan; Ozakin, Cuneyt] Uludag Univ, Dept Med Microbiol, Fac Med, Bursa, Turkey; [Karagoz, Alper; Jefferies, Meryem] Turkey Natl Publ Hlth Agcy, Dept Microbiol Reference Labs, Ankara, Turkey; [Cikman, Aytekin] Erzincan Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Erzincan, Turkey","Karakecili, F (corresponding author), Erzincan Univ, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol, Erzincan, Turkey.",,"Akalin, Halis/AAU-8952-2020; Özakın, Cüneyt/AAG-8392-2021","Özakın, Cüneyt/0000-0001-5428-3630",Ministry of Health Turkish Public Health Agency,This work was supported by Ministry of Health Turkish Public Health Agency.,,25,0,0,3,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1797.0,1803,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_166,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300010,,,,,2022-07-14

Among these intoxications, cases with cardiac involvement should be closely monitored. Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) is considered as a sensitive marker of cardiac dysfunction at recent years measurement of BNP levels provides considerable information about cardiac functions in a short time. In the present study, it is aimed to evaluate the relationship between blood Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) level and severity of intoxication in order to identify cardiac dysfunction caused by intoxication with cardiotoxic agents. Material and methods: Patients who arrived to adult emergency departments of two public hospitals due to poisoning caused by tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), beta blockers and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were recruited to the study. Taken drugs time, vital signs, and electrocardiograms were recorded. Blood BNP was analyzed within 2 hours after arrival to emergency department in order to determine BNP level. Results: 44 patients included in the study. When patients with BNP levels above or below the cut-off value were compared, it was found that hypotension rate was significantly higher and need for intensive care unit admission was significantly greater in patients with high BNP levels. When patients were considered regarding their ECG, no statistically significant relationship was found between BNP level and PR or QTc interval. However, a significant prolongation was detected in QRS interval in patients with high BNP levels, which is an indicator of ventricle contraction. Discussion and conclusion: Cardiotoxic drugs intoxication, hypotension and widening in QRS on ECG were found in patients with high blood BNP levels. In addition, intensive care unit admission ratio was found higher in patients with BNP level was above cut-off value. Regarding all these data, measurement of blood BNP level could be used for evaluation of cardiovascular toxicity risk.","[Karakilic, Evvah] Ankara Numune Training & Res Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Ankara, Turkey; [Solakoglu, Gorkem Alper] Dr Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Oncol Training & Res Hos, Dept Emergency, Ankara, Turkey; [Karakilic, Ilknur Demir] Sakarya Univ, Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Sakarya, Turkey","Karakilic, E (corresponding author), Ankara Numune Training & Res Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Ankara, Turkey.",,,"Solakoglu, Gorkem Alper/0000-0002-6936-4924",,,,19,1,1,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1791.0,1796,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_165,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300009,,,,,2022-07-14

Method: Pubmed, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were interrogated. Results: A total of 23 cases with coexistence of Behcet's disease and ankylosing spondylitis were found and afterwards reviewed. The majority of them involved male subjects (82.6%). All patients had mucocutaneous lesions and sacroiliitis, 54.5% of all patients had eye involvement, 68.4% had positive pathergy test, 75% had peripheral arthritis and 55.6% of patients developed ankylosing spondylitis after Behcet's disease. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors were used in six cases. HLA-B51 was positive in 57.1% and HLA-B27 in 59.1% of all cases. Conclusion: Even though Behcet's disease has some clinical and genetic features in common with spondyloarthritis, there remains no sufficient evidence that phenotypes of these shared features are identical or these features are traced to a similar pathogenesis. By taking into account all previously reported cases and our presented case, we suggest that ankylosing spondylitis should be considered in differential diagnosis as a coexisting condition when a Behcet's disease patient with low back pain is being examined.","[Kardes, Sinan; Karagulle, Mine; Karagulle, Mufit Zeki; Erdogan, Nergis] Istanbul Univ, Dept Med Ecol & Hydroclimatol, Istanbul Fac Med, Istanbul, Turkey","Kardes, S (corresponding author), Istanbul Tip Fak Fatih Cap, Tibbi Ekol & Hidroklimatol ABD, TR-34093 Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Karagülle, Müfit Zeki/AAD-6090-2020; Erdogan, Nergis/A-9030-2016; Kardes, Sinan/L-6731-2015; Karagülle, Mine/J-4418-2016","Erdogan, Nergis/0000-0001-9674-8547; Kardes, Sinan/0000-0002-6311-8634; Karagülle, Mine/0000-0002-8060-970X",,,,38,2,3,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,4.0,,,,,947.0,951,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_114,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DY1XF,WOS:000384887000014,,,,,2022-07-14

Smoking has long been defined as a changeable risk factor in life style for both bone loss and fractures. This study is aimed to compare of the bone turnover markers between smoker and non-smoker male. Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional and descriptive study, 85 smoker males were allocated to the case group, while 85 non-smoker males were allocated to the control group. Osteocalcin (OC) and osteoprotogerin (OPG) analyzed among bone formation parameters, while RANKL (Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand) and CTX (C-terminal telopeptide) were studied among the bone destruction parameters alongside with TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone), Ca (Calcium), P (Phosphorus), PTH (Parathyroid Hormone), ALP(Alkaline Phosphatase), TT (Total Testosterone), and vitamin D parameters that affect bone mineral density. Results: It was found that the smoker group's CTX level (50.30+/-26.97 ng/ml) was statistically significant lower than that of the non-smoker group (65.10+/-42.41 ng/ml. (p=0.007) The average serum PTH level of the smoker and non-smoker groups were 23.75+/-9.88 pg/ml and 31.35+/-13.15 pg/ml respectively and the related average of the non-smoker group was statistically higher than that of the smoker group (p=0.000). It was found that the smoker group's vitamin D (16.75+/-8.73 ng/ml) was statistically significant lower than that of the non-smoker group (19.50+/-8.97 ng/ml (p=0.044). Conclusions: The study supports the fact that one of the risk factors for osteoporosis is smoking and it negatively affects bone formation as well. It should be noted that osteoporosis is a significant health issue not only for older men but also for middle-aged male smokers and the necessary support for smoking cessation should be offered.","[Kargin, Nisa Cetin; Marakoglu, Kamile] Selcuk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Family Med, Konya, Turkey; [Unlu, Ali; Korucu, Emine Nedime] Selcuk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Biochem, Konya, Turkey; [Kebapcilar, Levent] Selcuk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Endocrinol, Konya, Turkey","Kargin, NC (corresponding author), Selcuk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Family Med, Konya, Turkey.",,"Marakoğlu, Kamile/GLT-1034-2022; Ünlü, Ali/F-5899-2013; KORUCU, EMİNE NEDİME/AAZ-7283-2021","Marakoğlu, Kamile/0000-0002-6585-7019; Ünlü, Ali/0000-0002-9991-3939; KORUCU, EMİNE NEDİME/0000-0001-7034-4130; CETIN KARGIN, Nisa/0000-0002-3819-2402",Selcuk University Scientific Research and Projects Comittee [13102005],Selcuk University Scientific Research and Projects Comittee funded this study (Project Number: 13102005).,,34,5,5,0,9,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,317.0,323,,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000007,,,,,2022-07-14

Ghrelin and leptin peptides play a crucial role in the homeostasis of the human body. Previously, some studies showed that H. pylori colonization had been associated with circulating leptin and ghrelin levels, but the certain relationship is still uncertain. The goal of this study is to determine the effects of H. pylori infection on serum ghrelin and leptin levels and how these relates to body weight changes before and after H. pylori eradication. Materials and methods: This study prospectively enrolled 129 dyspeptic patients who had received an endoscopy. A fasting blood sample was obtained from each patient for total ghrelin and leptin analysis. The body mass index (BMI) of each patient was also calculated. Results: Ninety-four patients tested positive and 35 patients tested negative for H. Pylori. There was no significant difference in the serum leptin and ghrelin levels and BMI between those with or without H. pylori infection. While serum ghrelin concentration was significantly decreased after eradication (8.97 +/- 0.61ng/ml, 6.96 +/- 0.41ng/ml, p = 0.005, respectively), serum leptin concentration and BMI did not change (6.13 +/- 0.86, 5.70 +/- 1.1, p = 0.79, 23.43 +/- 0.26, 23.16 +/- 0.24, p = 0.07, respectively). Conclusion: However, no difference was detected in serum ghrelin and leptin levels between H. pylori infected patients and controls, ghrelin levels were decreased with H. pylori eradication, and these differences were correlated with differences in BMI. In conclusion, H. pylori might be play a role on body weight change.","[Kefeli, Ayse] Karatay Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Konya, Turkey; [Yeniova, Abdullah Ozgur; Uzman, Metin] Kecioren Trainning & Res Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Ankara, Turkey; [Basyigit, Sebahat] Artvin State Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Artvin, Turkey; [Asilturk, Zeliha; Nazligul, Yasar] Kecioren Training Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Ankara, Turkey; [Tanrikulu, Yusuf] Karatay Univ, Fac Med, Gen Surg, Konya, Turkey","Kefeli, A (corresponding author), Karatay Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Konya, Turkey.",,"Kefeli, Ayse/AAD-3846-2019","Kefeli, Ayse/0000-0002-1876-2586",,,,49,1,1,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_139,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000010,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: This observational prospective study was performed to investigate the place of C. difficile in hospital acquired diarrhea between September 29, 2012, and September 4, 2013. Eighty-two patients between 2012 and 2013 were included in the study. The wards at which patients were admitted, causes of hospitalization, patients' demographics and underlying diseases were recorded. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and toxin A/B were investigated using enzyme immunoassay (EIA). In addition, toxin B, binary toxin genes, and tcdC gene deletion were analyzed with a real time-PCR. Results: A total of 82 patients were included in the study. C. difficile antigen was positive in 5 patients using enzyme immunoassay. Toxin A/B positivity was not found in any patients with enzyme immunoassay. Toxin-B gene positivity was found in 3 out of 5 patients with C. difficile antigen positivity with the real-time polymerase chain reaction method. Binary toxin gene positivity and single base deletion in nucleotide 117 of the tcdC gene were found in no patients. The incidence of hospital-originated C. difficile infection was calculated as 0.10 per 10,000 patient days and 0.06 per 10,000 patient admissions. Conclusion: CDI is seen in varying rates in different hospitals and countries. In addition, the test methods and kits used, transport, storage, and sample examination conditions, and the patients' epidemiological characteristics might influence the CDI rates.

Although the reliable and valid Dissociative Experience Scale (DES) as the gold-standard instrument to quantify the frequency of self-reported dissociative experiences, and as much the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI; as a self-report measure-validated in several languages) are useful for identifying adults at risk of developing acute and chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), they have not been validated in Iran and their predictive values remain unknown in this population. Objective: To assess the reliability and validity of the Persian version of Dissociative Experience Scale (DES) and the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI). Method: We included 43 male survivors of fatal motor vehicle accidents. The participants were assessed by PDI and DES, and were retested by DES, and assessed by Mississippi Scale for PTSD in three intervals of immediately after, one month and three months after the event. Results: The DES was significantly correlated with PTSD. Reliability analysis revealed a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.87. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient for test-retest analysis was 0.87. The PDI was not significantly correlated with PTSD and was borderline and not significantly correlated with DES. Reliability analysis revealed a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.73. Conclusion: Our results suggest that Persian versions of PDI and DES showed a desirable psychometric applicability, except for predictive criterion validity for PDI. In regard to predictive validity, DES but not PDI, might be good instruments to use as a reliable screening tool for future PTSD at least in the initial week after MVA.","[Kianpoor, Mohsen] Zahedan Univ Med Sci, Zahedan Med Sch, Psychiat, Zahedan, Iran; [Amouchie, Ramin; Mazidi, Mahdi; Abasian, Mahboobe; Saffarian, Zahra] Univ Social Welf & Rehabil Sci, Sch Behav Sci, Dept Clin Psychol, Clin Psychol, Tehran, Iran; [Raghibi, Mahvash] Univ Sistan & Baluchestan, Fac Educ Psychol, Psychol, Univ St, Zahedan, Iran; [Hesam, Saeed] ACECR, Royan Inst Reprod Biomed, Dept Epidemiol, Biostatist, Tehran, Iran; [Hesam, Saeed] ACECR, Royan Inst Reprod Biomed, Reprod Epidemiol Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Masoumi, Sarah] Shiraz Univ, Dept Educ Psychol, Shiraz, Iran; [Sadeghkhani, Ali] Univ Allameh Tabatabaei, Fac Psychol, Gen Psychol, Tehran, Iran","Amouchie, R (corresponding author), Univ Social Welf & Rehabil Sci, Sch Behav Sci, Dept Clin Psychol, Clin Psychol, Tehran, Iran.",ramin_amouchie@yahoo.com,"hesam, saeed/AAG-3289-2019","Mazidi Sharafabadi, Mahdi/0000-0002-0039-8229",,,,43,11,11,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,4.0,,1493.0,1501,,,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YQ,WOS:000392283200030,,,,,2022-07-14

Peritoneal tuberculosis or tuberculous peritonitis (TBP) is an uncommon form of extrapulmonary infection with a proportional increasing of its incidence. This disease is seen most commonly in young adults, and has a highly variable clinical symptomatology. Our aim is to highlight the nonspecific presentation and diagnostic difficulties of the TBP. Materials and methods. We retrospectively reviewed 27 TBP cases diagnosed between 2003 and 2014. Clinical features, all diagnostic methods, and the outcomes of treatment were analyzed in view of literature. Results: Abdominal distension and pain were the most frequent symptoms. A past history of pulmonary TB was obtained in 4 patients. Additionally, concomitant extraperitoneal TB was found in 15 cases. Ascites was the most sonographic finding. Acid-fast staining of ascitic fluid was positive in 1/19. Peritoneal biopsy via laparoscopy or laparotomy was positive for TBP in 13/14. Duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was found to be associated with prolongation of the treatment (p<0.001). In addition, pretreatment c-reactive protein was found to be significantly different between the patients requiring a standard therapy of 9 months and the patients requiring additional therapy of 3 months (p=0.023). Conclusion: The diagnosis of TBP is often difficult due to diverse presentation. The patient's anamnesis and the presence of ascites are the most significant marks in diagnosis. Laparoscopy with peritoneal biopsy seems to be the gold standard diagnostic method.","[Kilic, Murat Ozgur] Turgut Ozal Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, Ankara, Turkey; [Kilic, Murat Ozgur] Yenimahalle TB Control Dispensary, Ankara, Turkey; [Kilic, Yeliz] Dr Abdurrahman Yurtarslan Training & Res Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol & Reanimat, Ankara, Turkey; [Icen, Duygu] Hacettepe Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Stat, Ankara, Turkey","Kilic, MO (corresponding author), Turgut Ozal Univ, Dept Gen Surg, Alparslan Turkes Cad 57, TR-06510 Ankara, Turkey.",,"Kılıç, Yeliz/AAX-2687-2020; Kılıç, Murat Özgür/AAA-1340-2022","Kılıç, Yeliz/0000-0003-1446-7747; ",,,,28,0,0,0,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,11.0,16,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700001,,,,,2022-07-14

Together with biochemical and serological diagnostic methods and a histopathological assessment is important to detect necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in the liver. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values are tests often used to predict the histological stages of chronic hepatitis. Materials and methods: One hundred seventy-three patients who were referred to the Kahramanmaras Necip Fazil City Hospital Microbiology Laboratory with prediagnosis of HBV infection between September 2012-January 2016, were evaluated with necroinflammatory activity levels/ histological activity index (HAI) and fibrosis scores according to the ISHAK classification criteria, and the results were compared with alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and HBV-DNA serum levels of the time of biopsy. Results: The study included 63 female and 109 male patients. The mean age was 39.39 +/- 13.4 years. There was statistically significant difference in age, ALT, AST, and HBV DNA levels between patients in the high fibrosis group and the low fibrosis group (p: 0.034, 0.002, 0.0001, and 0.007, respectively). There was significant difference between patients from severe HAI and mild to moderate HAI groups in terms of AST values (p: 0.045). AST was found to be a risk factor for fibrosis, and ALT and AST were found to be risk factors for HAI. HBV DNA, ALT, and AST levels of HBe-Ag positive patients were significantly higher compared to HBe-Ag negative patients (p: 0,0001, 0,027, 0,008). Conclusions: In our study, advanced age, high HBV DNA, ALT and AST levels were found to be associated with fibrosis, and high AST levels were found to be associated with liver necroinflammation. It is thought that serum ALT and AST levels could be useful parameters for liver necroinflammation and fibrosis. Evaluation of these parameters in chronic hepatitis B patients as indicator parameters for advanced stages of fibrosis and necroinflammation would be a right approach.","[Kirisci, Ozlem; Caliskan, Ahmet; Tumer, Seray] Necip Fazil City Hosp, Dept Med Microbiol, Kahramanmaras, Turkey; [Paksoy, Tugba; Analan, Asiye; Kirmaci, Beyhan; Citil, Rana; Agirbas, Sule; Guzel, Zeki] Necip Fazil City Hosp, Dept Med Pathol, Kahramanmaras, Turkey; [Ozkaya, Esra] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Trabzon, Turkey; [Cikim, Gurkan] Necip Fazil City Hosp, Dept Med Biochem, Kahramanmaras, Turkey; [Senol, Hande] Pamukkale Univ, Fac Med, Dept Biostat, Denizli, Turkey","Kirisci, O (corresponding author), Necip Fazil City Hosp, Dept Med Microbiol, Kahramanmaras, Turkey.",,,"Ozkaya, Esra/0000-0003-1673-9101",,,,26,2,2,0,9,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1805.0,1811,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_167,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300011,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: In this qualitative study, 16 earthquake-affected women and 14 health providers from the three struck towns and their villages, and health center and deputy for healthcare of Red Crescent Society of East Azerbaijan province in Iran, participated in semi-structured interviews and data were analyzed by means of qualitative content analysis. Results: Four main categories were extracted including psychological complications, reproductive system physical damages, sexual health damages, and fertility regulation. The first category had two subcategories (short term and long term effects). Conclusion: Results showed that the earthquake had severe effects on some aspects of women's reproductive health, particularly on pregnant women and women in labor. Providing such cares, must therefore be prioritized in services for earthquake-affected women.

Materials and methods: 21rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: blank control group, model group, treatment group; in 14 of them, the asthma model was established. The rabbits in the treatment group was treated orally with RLD. The rats in the normal and model groups were given 0.9% saline. Metabolites were compared among the groups, which were determined by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods. Data was analyzed using SAS 8.0. Results: A total of 7 kinds of metabolites were detected from the Broncho alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of rabbits, and 4 kinds of metabolites were significant after statistic comparison. The content of some metabolites changed in the model group and treatment group compared with the control group. It could be inferred that the changing was affected by modeling and drug treatment. The increased content of glycine, aspartate and galactose as well as decreased content of myristic acid were closely related to the inflammatory process in bronchial asthma. These 4 metabolites' levels obviously changed after treatment with Recuperating Lung Decoction.

The objective of the study is to indicate the variations in NLR that occur in patients with major depressive disorder. Materials and methods: Forty prospective patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder based on DSM 4-TR and treated in our clinic were included in the study. The control group included forty healthy individuals that applied to our clinic, however were not diagnosed with active psychopathology in the initial examination, and have matching age and gender demographics with the patient group. Lymphocyte and neutrophil percentages taken during the application before the treatment were recorded in the related forms. NLR was calculated by the division of neutrophil rate by the lymphocyte rate for each patient. Results: There was no significant difference between the groups based on socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, income level, smoking, and employment. Mean NLR value was 1.58 +/- 0.59 in the patient group, and it was 2.05 +/- 0.89 in the control group. The difference between these mean values was statistically significant (p=0.007). In control group, the neutrophil percentage, and in patient group the lymphocyte percentage was significantly high. There was no difference between the groups on white blood cell count. Conclusion: It was determined that the NLR is significantly lower in patients with major depressive disorder when compared to the control group. The changes in NLR could reflect the changes in central nervous system metabolisms. Thus, NLR could be an indicator of the fact that immune system is suppressed in chronic inflammation in psychiatric diseases such as depressive disorder.","[Korkmaz, Sevda; Gundogan, Burcu; Korucu, Tuba; Dulkadir, Zehra Emine; Atmaca, Murad] Firat Univ, Fac Med, Dept Psychiat, TR-23169 Elazig, Turkey; [Denk, Affan] Firat Univ, Fac Med, Dept Infect, TR-23169 Elazig, Turkey; [Telo, Selda] Firat Univ, Fac Med, Dept Biochem, TR-23169 Elazig, Turkey","Korkmaz, S (corresponding author), Firat Univ, Fac Med, Dept Psychiat, TR-23169 Elazig, Turkey.",,"Atmaca, Murad/V-9377-2018; KORKMAZ, SEVDA/O-2867-2015; Telo, Selda/V-6019-2018; Telo, Selda/V-5992-2018","Telo, Selda/0000-0003-3655-0269; ",,,,17,4,4,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,795.0,798,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_92,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400021,,,,,2022-07-14

The lactate clearance of each patient was calculated according to the values of lactate upon referral, lactate at hours 6 and 24 in the blood gas analyses. Results: The mean lactate value upon referral in patients with normal liver enzymes was 0.97 +/- 0.48 mmol/L, whereas this was 1.68 +/- 0.63 mmol/L in patients with elevated liver enzymes. The mean lactate clearance values at the 24th hour were 25.76 +/- 14.80% and 36.05 +/- 14.22%, respectively. The mean lactate clearance values at the 24th hour in patients undergoing hemoperfusion and patients not undergoing hemoperfusion were 14.26 +/- 23.52% and 39.48 +/- 14.33%, respectively. The lactate clearance at the 24th hour was significantly higher; particularly in patients with elevated liver enzymes who had received hemoperfusion along with supportive therapy (p<0.001). Conclusion: Mushroom poisoning patients with high blood lactate levels on admission to the hospital should be approached carefully with regard to requirement for hemoperfusion and the prognosis.","[Koylu, Oznur] Konya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Biochem, Konya, Turkey; [Koylu, Ramazan] Konya Training & Res Hosp, Emergency Dept, Konya, Turkey; [Dundar, Zerrin Defne] NecmettinErbakan Univ, Meram Fac Med, Dept Emergency Med, Konya, Turkey","Koylu, O (corresponding author), Konya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Biochem, Konya, Turkey.",,"Dundar, Zerrin Defne/AAR-4130-2020; Koylu, Ramazan/AGQ-8717-2022",,,,,23,1,1,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,291.0,295,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000003,,,,,2022-07-14

In the present study we evaluated patients diagnosed with nodular goiter according to preoperative thyroid fine needle aspiration cytology and who also underwent thyroidectomy. Materials and methods: The case reports, pathologic reports, and stained sections of 1149 patients who were admitted and underwent thyroidectomy specimens were retrospectively evaluated. Results: The cytology and histology records were correlated for 260 cases. The 1149 cases included in this study consisted of 1020 female and 129 male cases with a mean age of 41.4 years (range, 13 to 82 years). The distribution of histological findings are as follows: 999 (72.3%) cases were found to be non-neoplastic and 150 cases (13.1%) were neoplastic. Postoperative histologic evaluation demonstrated 939 (81.7%) cases of nodular hyperplasia, 70 (6.1%) cases of papillary carcinoma, 55 (4.8%) cases of follicular adenoma, 39 (3.4%) cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The correlation of cytology and histopathology showed that 145 of 260 FNA results (55.7%) were concordant, whereas 8 patients (3%) had discordant results. Eighty-five cases were excluded for being non-diagnostic. Histological review revealed incidental papillary thyroid carcinoma in 62 (5.39 %) patients. Mean tumor size was 1.26 cm. Conclusion: Nodular hyperplasia was the most common histopathological finding followed by papillary thyroid carcinoma. Improved imaging techniques combined with the correct use of fine-needle aspiration diagnoses may reduce the number of cases that are not treatable by thyroidectomy. It is likely that the early detection of some thyroid cancers is primarily incidental.","[Koyuncuer, Ali; Bayraktar, Suphi Gurman] Antakya State Hosp, Dept Pathol, Antakya, Turkey; [Gurkan, Eren] Antakya State Hosp, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, Antakya, Turkey","Koyuncuer, A (corresponding author), Antakya State Hosp, Dept Pathol, Antakya, Turkey.",,"Koyuncuer, Ali/I-7999-2014; gürkan, eren/A-8172-2019","Koyuncuer, Ali/0000-0002-0994-1275; ",,,,59,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,35.0,43,,,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700005,,,,,2022-07-14

A lot of image denoising methods have been introduced to smooth the fluence map. Recently, some convex optimization models have been proposed for this work. These methods only consider depressing the map complexity, but neglect the latter leaf sequencing process. Therefore, they can not bring the map complexity to the best state for dose modulation. Material and methods: The monitor unit based map convex smoothing model has depressed the total number of monitor unit of the fluence map to the lowest state, but they do not consider the uniformity of each beam dose modulation. Large or small monitor units will lead to the inaccuracy of ray modulation. Furthermore, large difference of the monitor units for each beam fields will lead to the beam angle or beam number adjustment. Based on the above consideration, we proposed a novel regularization smoothing model for fluence map optimization of inverse planning in Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy. We not only consider depressing the total number of monitor units, but also balancing all of them in the model. Results: We test this model in a prostate case, and compare with two kind of smoothing methods as well as the monitor unit based map convex smoothing model. The results show our regularization smoothing method will lead to a lower complexity and much more balanced fluence map for the latter leaf sequencing process. Discussion: The obvious advantage of the proposed model is that the fluence map complexity is low, as well as the monitor unit distribution of each beam is more evenly.","[Lan, Yihua; Wang, Jianfang; Song, Xiao; Cheng, Ning] Nanyang Normal Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Nanyang 473061, Peoples R China; [Lan, Yihua; Song, Xiao; Cheng, Ning] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Ctr Biomed Imaging & Bioinformat, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xing] Nanyang Normal Univ, Network Ctr, Nanyang 473061, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yang] Cent Hosp Nanyang, Dept Radiol, Nanyang 473061, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaoli] Nanyang Normal Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Nanyang 473061, Peoples R China","Wang, JF (corresponding author), Nanyang Normal Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Nanyang 473061, Peoples R China.",,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [61401242, U1504605]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M572142]; key scientific and technological project of HeNan [152102210335]; Research Foundation for Advanced Talents of Nanyang Normal University [ZX2014058]","This work was financially supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61401242, No. U1504605), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(Grant No. 2015M572142), the key scientific and technological project of HeNan (152102210335), the Research Foundation for Advanced Talents of Nanyang Normal University (ZX2014058).",,11,1,1,2,9,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,3.0,,1137.0,1142,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YM,WOS:000392282800004,,,,,2022-07-14

However, accurate segmentation of suspicious masses from surrounding breast tissues is a challenging and difficult task as lesion boundaries are usually overlapping or touching normal structures, obscured or irregular or low contrast. The aim of this paper is to propose an accurate and robust algorithm for mammographic mass segmentation. Material and methods: In this paper, we present new scheme for accurately segmenting breast lesions in mammograms. To achieve this task, two stages are included in this scheme. In the first, a hyperbolic secant template was applied to locate a rough rectangular region of breast lesions. Then, based on the rough region, C-V (Chan-Vese) model was employed to obtain the contour of the being segmented lesions in this region. 483 regions of interest (ROIs) extracted from 328 patients were taken from a publicly available database, the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and formed as the test data set. Area based and boundary distance based similarity measures based on radiologists' manually marked signs were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach and other four algorithms. This paper also provided a comparison between the proposed approach and other four different segmentation algorithms (i.e., Geodesic Active Contours, C-V model, Timp and Karssemeijer's dynamic programming method and marker-controlled watershed segmentation method). Results: Experimental results show that our scheme are better than those of other algorithms, the mean overlap percentage and combined measure were 0.7198 0.1149, 0.8056 0.08 respectively. Form experimental results, we also notice that values for all the measures distribution of the proposed method were. Discussion: Through the comparison, our scheme has better performance to improve the accuracy of lesions segmentation than other four algorithms.","[Lan, Yihua; Song, Xiao; Song, Enming] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Biomed Imaging & Bioinformat, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Lan, Yihua; Li, Zhenshuang; Liu, Jinjiang] Nanyang Normal Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Nanyang 473061, Peoples R China; [Wan, Jinxin] Lianyungang Second Peoples Hosp, Dept Med Imaging, Lianyungang 222005, Peoples R China; [Shen, Kunxiao] Nanyang Normal Univ, Sch Biol Engn, Nanyang 473061, Peoples R China","Song, X (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Biomed Imaging & Bioinformat, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [61401242, 61370179, U1504605]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M572142]; key scientific and technological project of HeNan [152102210335]; Research Foundation for Advanced Talents of Nanyang Normal University [ZX2014058]","This work was financially supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61401242, 61370179, No. U1504605), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2015M572142), the key scientific and technological project of HeNan (152102210335), the Research Foundation for Advanced Talents of Nanyang Normal University (ZX2014058).",,19,1,1,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,3.0,,1159.0,1165,,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YM,WOS:000392282800008,,,,,2022-07-14

Materilas and methods: Thirty cases of COP confirmed by pathology between November 2007 and May, 2014 from two comprehensive hospitals in Shanghai and Huzhou were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical manifestations, radiographic features, laboratory results, treatments, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Results: The mean age of COP patients was 55.2 +/- 15.2 years, and their main symptoms included cough, phlegm and fever. Patchy consolidation was the most common lesion, followed by mass/nodule. The leukocyte count was normal while the neutrophil percentage was increased in most patients. Platelet count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were increased. Pulmonary function test results could be normal, restrictive, obstructive, or mixed pattern. The diagnosis of COP was mainly confirmed through computerized tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous needle lung biopsy. COP patients responded poorly to antibiotics but responded well to corticosteroid therapy. Conclusion: The clinical manifestations, radiological changes, and laboratory results from COP are nonspecific. CT guided percutaneous needle lung biopsy is the key for the diagnosis. Strengthening the recognition of COP would avoid the use of antibiotics.","[Li, Feng; Sun, Xiaoyuan; Guo, Haiying; Bao, Wuping; Chen, Yuqing; Li, Qiang; Zhou, Xin] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Peoples Hosp 1, Dept Resp Med, 100 Haining Rd, Shanghai 200080, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xiaoqing; Cui, Enhai] Hu Zhou Cent Hosp, Dept Resp Med, Huzhou 313000, Peoples R China","Zhou, X (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Peoples Hosp 1, Dept Resp Med, 100 Haining Rd, Shanghai 200080, Peoples R China.",,"Bao, Wuping/AAX-5674-2020","Li, Feng/0000-0002-0646-6560",National Key Clinical Department of Respiratory Disease Program; Shanghai Pujiang Program [14PJD027],This study was funded by grants from National Key Clinical Department of Respiratory Disease Program (2011) and the Shanghai Pujiang Program (14PJD027).,,13,0,0,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,817.0,822,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_96,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400025,,,,,2022-07-14

All patients underwent abdominal CT, B ultrasound and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnostic results of different detection methods were compared and analyzed by professional image analysis staff. The results show that the detection rate of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging is significantly higher than that of abdominal CT and B ultrasound, with the difference between the two groups P<0.05, statistically significant. The detection rate of CT is significantly higher than that of 13 ultrasound, difference value P<0.05, statistically, significant.

Materials and methods: In this research, 1000 patients, who have been clinically diagnosed with lung cancer, were selected into observation group, in which there were 312 patients of small cell carcinoma, 458 with adenocarcinoma, and remaining 330 with squamous carcinoma. In addition, 200 healthy people were selected as research objects in control group. Electrochemistry luminescence method was adopted to test index levels of the two groups, respectively, with test items including CYFRA21-1, NSE, CEA, CA19-9, CA125, SCC. Results: Test results showed the serum indexes of observation group were significantly higher than those of control group. In addition, through comparing 3 different types of lung cancer patients, patients with small cell carcinoma had a significantly higher concentration of serum NSE than those with squamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma; the concentrations of CA125, CEA, CA19-9 in patients with adenocarcinoma were higher than that of patients with squamous carcinoma or small cell carcinoma; the concentrations of CYFRA21-1 in patients with squamous carcinoma was the highest of the three. Moreover, it finally confirmed 958 lung cancer patients in total by testing 6 serum indexes of all selected patients, with positive rate accounting for 87.09%. Conclusion: As a result, it is of vital significance to test serum indexes such as CYFRA21-1, NSE, CEA, CA19-9, CA125, SCC for suspected lung cancer patients, and the concentrations of different indexes play key roles in confirming type of lung cancer. Finally, it concluded that joint detection of serum markers can further enhance diagnosis efficiency, which should be promoted in clinical practice.","[Li, Yong; Li, Xiaohui; Shi, Gongning; Wang, Pei; Ma, Hongbing] Henan Univ, Huaihe Hosp, Ward Cardiothorac Surg 1, Kaifeng 475000, Peoples R China","Li, Y (corresponding author), Henan Univ, Huaihe Hosp, Ward Cardiothorac Surg 1, Kaifeng 475000, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,10,2,2,1,15,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_148,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000019,,,,,2022-07-14

It is also one of the primary organisms responsible for drug resistant infections. The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial resistance profile of P. aeruginosa, the presence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and pan drug-resistant (PDR) strains and distribution of the most common serotypes among hospitalized patients in University Clinical Center of Kosovo (UCCK). Materials and methods: During a one-year period, 229 P. aeruginosa were isolated from infected patients in clinics of UCCK from a variety of clinical sites. 80 isolates were studied as the primary isolates from the group of infected patients. P. aeruginosa isolates were identified using standard laboratory procedures. Susceptibility of isolates to antimicrobial agents was investigated using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion assay (EUCAST 2013). All isolates were serotyped by slide agglutination with commercial sera from Biorad. Results: The most prevalent serotype was 011; this serotype showed higher resistance to antibiotics compared with other serotypes. Serotype 011 isolates were generally susceptible to imipenem and meropenenz, and most often resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, and piperacillin-tazobactam. Thirteen of 80 (283%) P. aeruginosa were MDR and 7 of 80 (8.8%) P. aeruginosa were XDR of the isolates tested. No PDR P. aeruginosa were detected. Multiply resistant strains were most frequently isolated from Intensive Care Unit patients. Conclusion: The present study provides data gathering from a region where there is not a wealth of data available. It is of utmost importance in an increasing antibiotic crisis. Prudent use of carbapenems is of deep importance. Imipenem and meropenem should be reserved for treatment of MDR P. aeruginosa. Existence and escalation of multiresistant strains, especially of MDR, XDR P. aeruginosa necessitates continuous surveillance, development strategies and increased control of prescription practices.","[Lila, Greta; Mulliqi-Osmani, Gjyle; Bajrami, Rrezarta; Raka, Lul] Univ Prishtina, Fac Med, Prishtina 10000, Kosovo, Croatia; [Mulliqi-Osmani, Gjyle; Kurti, Arsim; Raka, Lul] Natl Inst Publ Hlth Kosovo, Prishtina 10000, Kosovo, Croatia; [Azizi, Elvir] Trepharm, Qual Control Lab, Sllatine E Madhe 12050, Kosovo, Croatia","Lila, G (corresponding author), Ferat Draga 18, Pristina 10000, Kosovo, Croatia.",,"Raka, Lul/A-8019-2016",,,,,34,1,1,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,829.0,835,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_98,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400027,,,,,2022-07-14

The patients were randomly divided by digital methods into control group and observation group, with 1500 cases each. Conventional hemostasis was, adopted for control group patients, when they were treated by otolaryngology and neck surgery, while bunting was adopted to stop bleeding for the experimental, group patients in clinical surgery. The hemostatic status of the two groups of patients was recorded and analyzed by professional nursing staff. The results show different hemostatic effects in the two GROUPS's of patients. The experimental group had preoperative intramuscular injection of bunting, and 45 patients achieved excellent hemostasis effect, with the hemostatic rate reaching 92% (138011500). After comparison of the hemostasis effect of conventional hemostasis method in the control group, bleeding volume and operation time of the observation group were significantly lower than that of control group patients. The difference between the two groups P<0.05, was statistically significant. The study found that various cases may arise in clinical process of otolaryngology head and neck surgery; the situation is relatively complex. Therefore, the conventional hemostasis method cannot be applied to every operation, and clinical application of bunting can not only compensate for this defect, but also produce good effect on hemostasis and coagulation, while effectively shortening operation time, reducing the patient's physical and economic burden, and thus is worthy to be widely promoted and applied in clinics.","[Lin, Zhonghao; Cai, Zhiliang; Chen, Miaoan; Lin, Qingqing] Fujian Med Univ, Affiliated Mindong Hosp, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Ningde 355000, Peoples R China; [Ruan, Huiqing] Fujian Med Univ, Affiliated Mindong Hosp, Dept Endocrinol, Ningde 355000, Peoples R China","Lin, QQ (corresponding author), Fujian Med Univ, Affiliated Mindong Hosp, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Ningde 355000, Peoples R China.",,,,Ningde science and technology [20130140],2013 Ningde science and technology project number 20130140.,,10,1,1,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,1.0,,575.0,578,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DN9SI,WOS:000377420600024,,,,,2022-07-14

The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of BNP and Light's criteria in the diagnosis of HF were analyzed. Results: 109 patients were included. Serum BNP and percentage of Light's negative patients are higher in patients with HF than those without. When combining BNP positive with Light's criteria together, the diagnostic sensitivity increased to 86.8%. BNP negative together with Light's positive had a good exclusive diagnostic value. The cutoff value of BNP was proved to be 186.9 pg/ml the diagnosis of HF for patients with bilateral pleural effusion. Conclusion: Combined use of BNP and Light's criteria could increase the diagnostic sensitivity in patients with bilateral pleural effusion and could help recognize those without HF.

Most of PCOS women have great pressure because of infertility. Aim of our study is to observe the clinical efficacy of acupuncture therapy on the treatment of anxiety disorder in patients with PCOS and compare the therapeutic effect differences between acupuncture therapy and Clomiphene Citric (CC) therapy. Materials and methods: 90 PCOS patients were allocated into acupuncture combined with CC group (group A), acupuncture group (group B) and CC group (group C) randomly, 30 cases in each group. The acupoints were Ganshu (BL18), Shenshu (BL23), Zhongwan (CV12), Shuifen (CV9), Guanyuan (CV4), Zhongji (CV3). Back-shu points were used alternatively. Fast rotating needling insertion method and mild reinforcing-reducing manipulation were operated. The needle retaining time was 30 minutes. The patients in group A and group B received acupuncture therapy 3 times per week. The CC was taken on the 5th-9th day of menstrual cycle. All the patients were treated for 3 months and followed-up for 1 month. The self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and ovulation rate of the 3 groups were counted. Results: 3 cases dropped out in the trail. The SAS scores declined both of group A and B after treatment. The ovulation rates of group A, B and C were as follows: 86.21%, 66.67% and 69.64%. The clinical efficacy of group A was higher than the other groups (P<0.05). Discussion: Acupuncture therapy can enhance ovulation rate of PCOS patients effectively as well as CC therapy. But it is a better method to improve the anxiety disorder than CC therapy. The combined application of acupuncture therapy and CC therapy has better curative effect, which should be widely spread in clinics.","[Ma Hong] Binzhou Med Univ, Dept Rehabil, 346 Guanhai Rd, Yantai 264003, Peoples R China; [Quan Xiaohong; Wu Cai] Guangzhou Univ Chinese Med, Clin Coll 2, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen Xiuhua] Guangdong Hosp TCM, Tradit Therapy Ctr, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Ma, H (corresponding author), Binzhou Med Univ, Dept Rehabil, 346 Guanhai Rd, Yantai 264003, Peoples R China.",mhong0531@163.com,,,Binzhou Medical University Scientific research fund project [BY2014KYQD31],This trail was funded by Binzhou Medical University Scientific research fund project (NO.

Ezetimibe possesses a relatively low lipid-modifying activity, but is less likely to cause liver dysfunction. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of ezetimibe-based therapy in hyperlipidemia patients with concomitant liver dysfunction. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of ezetimibe combined with metformin and simvastatin in the treatment of hyperlipidemia patients with liver dysfunction. Materials and methods: From January 2012 to March 2014, 210 hyperlipidemia patients with liver dysfunction were enrolled and assigned to control (a low-dose sinzvastatin), ezetimibe + a low-dose simvastatin (ES) or ezetimibe + metformin + a low-dose simvastatin (EMS) groups (n=70 per group). Before treatment, the blood lipids, glucose, creatine kinase (CK), and liver and kidney functions were detected. Patients with >= 2x upper limit of normal values of transaminases were excluded. Treatment was conducted for 3 months. CK, aspartate transminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and bilirubin were measured after 3-month treatment. Results: After 3-month treatment, significant reductions were found in total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in three groups. The CK, TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C and liver function were significantly different among 3 groups after 3-month treatment. Conclusion: Ezetimibe-based therapy has more potent lipid-modifying capability in hyperlipidemia patients with liver dysfunction, without deteriorating liver function.","[Mao, Youlin; Yuan, Yiqiang; Wang, Ruimin; Huang, Qiong; Zhao, Yujie; Zhao, Luosha] Zhengzhou Univ, Dept Cardiol, Hosp 1, Zhengzhou 450052, Peoples R China","Zhao, LS (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Dept Cardiol, Hosp 1, Zhengzhou 450052, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,20,1,1,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,837.0,842,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_99,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400028,,,,,2022-07-14

This procedure is usually performed in prone position accompany with inserting nephrostomy tube, but recent studies suggested that tubeless PCNL in supine position is as well as and in some ways are better than the standard PCNL in prone position. So, this study was conducted to compare the success and complications of tubeless PCNL in prone and supine position. Materials and methods: In this randomized clinical trial 64 patients aged 18 years and over with renal or upper ureteral stones that were referred toShahidBeheshti hospital of Yasuj from 2013 march to 2015 February for PCNL and met inclusion criteria, were randomly assigned to undergo surgery in supine or prone position after taking informed consent. All PCNLs were done with fluoroscopy-guided by one urologist. After operation without inserting any tube Amplatz dilator removed and patients were transferred to recovery and ward. In the first postoperative day, if there were no complications, patients were discharged. One week later, patients were visited again and Kidney-ureters-bladder (KUB) plain radiography and ultrasonography were done for assessing the success rate. Data were analyzed by SPSS21 software using descriptive and analytical statistics. Results: Mean size of stones in patients underwent surgery in supine and prone position were 32.81+/-5.2 mm and 36.25+/-4.3 mm, respectively(p=0.47).

In addition, there is increasing evidence for the potential positive effect of statin therapy on the outcome of patients with sepsis. Material and methods: In a randomized double blinded clinical trial, we evaluated 60 patients aged 18-85 with confirmed sepsis. We evaluated APACHE II score and all-cause mortality as outcome predictors. Results: The APACHE score in days1 and 3 was not significantly different between two groups, but in day 7 it was significantly higher in group B than group A. Survival after one month (mean +/- 95% CI) also had not significant differences. The number needed to treat (NNT) was 5. Conclusion: The mainstem of the studies suggest that statins may have a positive effect on the outcome of patients with sepsis.

The burning of biomass also results in a release of benzene. Epidemiological studies show evidence for a causal association between leukemia and exposure to benzene. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate urinary benzene as biomarker of exposure to environmental benzene. Urine samples were collected from 73 adult males resident in Tehran, Iran. The urinary level of benzene was analyzed using by head space solid phase micro extraction-gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry method (HS-SPME-GC-MS-method). Median value of U-BEN was 0.94 mu g/l (range from 0.2 to 2.9). The results of this study showed that urinary benzene is higher than values shown in prior studies. Thus, these high values may have undesirable health effects on the people resident in Tehran. Since urinary benzene behave in a similar way to blood benzene, urinary benzene due to the quick accessibility of urine and a non-invasive option is useful for environmental exposure and for epidemiology studies. As a result, the role of passive smoking and high traffic as the most important contributor to benzene exposure is very important.","[Mirzaei, Nezam; Naddafi, Kazem; Raminnabizadeh; Yaghmaeian, Kamyar; Assanvand, Mohammad Sadegh; Yunesian, Masud] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Mirzaei, Nezam; Naddafi, Kazem; Raminnabizadeh; Assanvand, Mohammad Sadegh; Yunesian, Masud] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Ctr Air Pollut Res CAPR, Inst Environm Res IER, Tehran, Iran; [Yaghmaeian, Kamyar] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Ctr Water Qual Res, Inst Environm Res IER, Tehran, Iran; [Maroufizadeh, Saman] ACECR, Royan Inst Reprod Biomed, Reprod Epidemiol Res Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Reprod Hlth,Biostat, Tehran, Iran; [Hoseini, Mohammad] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Engn, Shiraz, Iran; [Adabi, Shervin] Kurdistan Univ Med Sci, Environm Hlth Res Ctr, Sanandaj, Iran","Yunesian, M (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Engn, Tehran, Iran.;Yunesian, M (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Ctr Air Pollut Res CAPR, Inst Environm Res IER, Tehran, Iran.",yunessian@tums.ac.ir,"Hoseini, Mohammad/AAG-3241-2019; Maroufizadeh, Saman/AAC-1383-2019; Mirzaei, Nezam/G-3232-2017; Hoseini, Mohammad/M-6971-2017; naddafi, kazem/L-8831-2017","Hoseini, Mohammad/0000-0001-5180-3047; Mirzaei, Nezam/0000-0003-4779-1519; Hoseini, Mohammad/0000-0001-5180-3047; naddafi, kazem/0000-0003-0671-0401; Yunesian, Masud/0000-0002-2870-7433; Maroufizadeh, Saman/0000-0001-5794-3876",Institute for Environmental Research (IER) of Tehran University of Medical Sciences [94-01-46-27589],This work was funded by the Institute for Environmental Research (IER) of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (grant number 94-01-46-27589).,,39,5,6,0,8,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,4.0,,1471.0,1475,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YQ,WOS:000392283200027,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective statistical analysis on the clinical and demographic data assessed by examining the patient charts of 703 patients with BD who were admitted to the Behcet outpatient clinic in Erciyes University Department of Dermatology between 1998-2010. Results: Seven hundred and three patients were included in this study, of which 297 (42.2%) were male, and 406 (57.8%) were female. The mean age at diagnosis of the disease was 30.1 +/- 19.1 years. Mucocutaneous findings were the most frequent and first seen findings of the disease. The most frequent finding after mucocutaneous ones was ocular involvement. It was observed that vascular involvement was more common in male patients compared to female ones. In contrast, genital ulcer, erythema nodosum and arthralgia were seen more in female patients than in males. Conclusion: There is not a specific laboratory, monitoring or histopathologic examining method for the diagnosis and assessment of the prognosis of the disease.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of endurance training on Adiponectin and insulin resistance in overweight female university students. Methods: In this regard, 20 sedentary young women subject (BMI >= 25) have randomly been divided into to two similar groups (endurance training and control). The endurance training program was performed three days a week for 12 weeks at a definite intensity and distance. Before and after 12 weeks intervention, Adiponectin, weight and body composition, Vo2max were measured for all subjects. Data were analyzed by independent t-test (p <= 0.05). Results: the results illustrated that endurance training caused a significant difference in Adiponectin, Vo2max, body weight and fat percent of the body of the experimental group in comparison to control group. Conclusion: endurance training leads to a significant increase of the levels of Adiponectin and significant decrease in insulin resistance. This suggests that the insulin resistance is affected by endurance training that may be mediated, even partially through increased Adiponectin in overweight female university students.","[Nader, Shakeri] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Phys Educ & Sport Sci, Tehran, Iran; [Shahram, Soheily] Islamic Azad Univ, Shahr E Qods Branch, Dept Phys Educ & Sport Sci, Tehran, Iran; [Elham, Yadegari] Islamic Azad Univ, South Tehran Branch, Dept Phys Educ & Sport Sci, Tehran, Iran","Nader, S (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Phys Educ & Sport Sci, Tehran, Iran.",nsprofsport@mail.com,,,"Islamic Azad University, science and research Branch","The researchers hereby extend their appreciation to the Research and Technology vice chancellor of Islamic Azad University, science and research Branch for sponsoring this project.",,29,2,2,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,2.0,,1007.0,1010,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SU,WOS:000390175400027,,,,,2022-07-14

Human papilloma virus (HPV) subtypes 6 and 11 are responsible for this condition in about 90% of cases. Transmission of this virus occurs via direct contact with skin and sexual contact. The objective of this study was to determine living condition and involved anatomic areas of 206 women with genital warts. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 206 women who presented to our university dermatology clinic and for whom the diagnosis of genital wart was made were included. They noted the warts by themselves or by their sexual partner. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients to participate in this study. A checklist was designed which included variables namely living condition, age, and anatomic areas affected by genital warts. Results: Mean age of the patients was 31 years. About 39.2% of the cases had educational level of high school diploma or higher. Illiteracy was detected in five percent of the population. About 65.3% of the cases were married and 34.6% was single.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of high and low doses of sublingual misoprostol with intravenous oxytocin in reducing bleeding in cesarean section deliveries. Materials and methods: In this clinical trial, 185 women who underwent cesarean section in Imam Reza Hospital during 9 months of the 2011-12 year were selected by convenience sampling method. Patients were randomly assigned to three groups with foursome random blocks: misoprostol 400 mcg, 200 mcg misoprostol and oxytocin 20 units were conducted. Results: The groups were matched for age, BMI and gravidity. Bleeding after delivery was significantly (P=0.003) in the oxytocin group lower and in the misoprostol 400 mcg group was higher than others. Oxytocin group (n=5), compared to the other groups had a greater need for blood transfusion (P=0.031). 400 mcg misoprostol group (n=3) were less likely to require oxytocin infusion (P=0.042). The three groups did not differ in terms of developing the complication. Conclusion: Emergency and elective cesarean patients using sublingual misoprostol 200 mcg needs no blood transfusion. This protocol can be a safe and effective alternative to the use of sublingual misoprostol 400 mcg and 20 IU oxytocin. It is suggested that in cesarean section to reduce the need for transfusion of blood and lost blood, the prescription be taken into account.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of aromatherapy on pain after orthopedic surgery. Methods: This study is a randomized and controlled clinical trial involving 82 patients undergoing orthopedic surgery of wrist fracture in randomly selected hospitals of Tehran in 2015. The patients of the treatment group, 8 and 16 hours after surgery, sniffed 3 drops of essential oil of lemon for 20 minutes and the intensity of pain was measured half an hour after the intervention. For the control group, routine healthcare services continued. Data was analyzed using the SPSS 21 software and descriptive and inferential statistics. Moreover, in order to measure the effects of aromatherapy and change trends, repeated measures ANOVA was used. Chi-square test was also used to determine the success rate of the treatment. Results: Comparison of changes in pain scores between the two groups showed that there is a significant relationship (p=. 049) between the intensity of pain in control and treatment groups during the examined intervals (mean of pain and anxiety reduction 8 and 16 hours after surgery). There was also a significant relationship between the recovery rates of the control and treatment groups and different intervals (p=. 008). Conclusion: The results of the study indicate a positive impact of aromatherapy with essential oils of lemon on the reduction of pain, 8 and 16 hours after orthopedic surgery.

Research results suggest thatTranexamic Acid (TA) plays a major role in reducing bleeding after heart surgery. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of preoperative TA and post-CPB TA on the decrease in bleeding after heart surgery. Materials and methods: A total of 60 patients, who were candidates for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG), were randomly categorized into two groups after their written consent was obtained. First, before the surgery, TA was added to the serum of group I and normal saline was added to the serum of group II. After detachment from CPB, normal saline was injected to group I and TA was injected to group II. Postoperative bleeding was measured based on the volume of blood flowing into the chest bottle of patients and the number of blood units transfused to patients after surgery was recorded. Results: Investigation results revealed that although bleeding during surgery in the pre-pump group was higher than the post-pump group, the difference was not significant. The average volume of bleeding in the pre-pump group was higher than the post-pump group, but the difference was not statistically significant either. Moreover, pre-pump TA did not lead to a reduction in the need for transfusion during surgery. The level of bleeding in the first 2 hours after hospitalization in ICU was significant lower in the pre-pump group. However, no significant difference was observed between the duration stay of the groups in ICU. Conclusion: Pre-pump administration of TA did not result in a significant decrease in bleeding during surgery, need for transfusion, duration of stay in ICU, and duration of hospitalization as compared to post-pump TA administration.","[Negargar, Sohrab] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Anesthesiol & Crit Care, Tabriz, Iran; [Naghipour, Bahman] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Anesthesiol, Tabriz, Iran; [Anvari, Shahriar] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Cardiovasc Surg, Tabriz, Iran; [Enamzadeh, Elgar; Shiriza-Deh, Maryam] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran","Negargar, S (corresponding author), Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Anesthesiol & Crit Care, Tabriz, Iran.",negargars@yahoo.com,"anvari, shahriar/M-2997-2017; negargar, sohrab/AAD-9329-2022; naghipour, bahman/AAH-7403-2019; Enamzadeh, E/W-4893-2019","anvari, shahriar/0000-0002-4079-3530; ",,,,17,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,4.0,,1231.0,1235,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YQ,WOS:000392283200007,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: This retrospective, comparative, cohort study included 33 eyes of 33 patients with keratoconus stage II and III according to Amsler-Krumeich classification. Two groups were performed for this study with 1 year follow up. The group 1 received MyoRing implantation and the group 2 received CXL approximately 12 months before MyoRing implantation. All patients had a complete pre and post-operative examination including visual, refractive and keratometry examinations. Results: In Group 1 at the end of follow up the mean UDVA and CDVA improved by 9 and 4 lines of logMAR. In Group 2 the mean UDVA and CDVA improved by 8 and 2 lines of logMAR. There was not observed a statistically significant difference between mean UDVA of two groups postoperatively (p = 0.142) whereas the mean CDVA in Group 2 was significantly better than mean Group 1 at the end of follow up (p = 0.018). Spherical equivalent error and refractive astigmatism were significantly reduced in both groups which no statistically significant differences was noted in these refractive parameters between two groups. The mean keratometric values also were reduced in both groups at the end of follow up which no statistically significant difference was observed between two groups. Conclusion: Both MyoRing implantation alone and combined MyoRing implantation with previously CXL were safe and effective methods for moderate and severe keratoconus and resulted in similar clinical outcomes after one year follow up.

Since the method analyzes genetic markers, finding a pattern or rare marker for certain diseases is very important, it may be a useful tool for disease prognosis and diagnosis. Objective: Investigate dermatoglyphics as a prognosis method for hypertension. Method: This is an applied analytical study, with a quantitative approach, using the technical procedures of descriptive research. The sample was composed of 268 adults, 134 with hypertension and 134 controls, of both sexes and different ages. Fingerprints were collected from all fingers, starting with the little finger on the left hand and concluding with the little finger on the right hand. The method applied to determine the profile of individuals is computerized dermatoglyphics, using a dermatoglyphic reader to collect the fingerprints. Statistical analyses were processed in Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS), 20.0, at a significance level of p <= 0.05. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to compare the two groups and their quantitative variables to determine if they were normally distributed. In the event of non-normal distribution, the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test was applied to compare the following numerical variables. Results: There was a significant difference in the number of lines on finger 5 of the right hand, the hypertensive group exhibiting the lowest number. In addition to the statistically significant difference in the ulnar loop pattern on the 5th finger of the left hand, and 4th and 5th of the right hand, this pattern appeared more frequently in the hypertensive group. This evidence confirms the existence of a rare marker revealed by dermatoglyphics in patients with hypertension, demonstrating the use of dermatoglyphics as an additional parameter in identifying individuals with this disease.","[Nodari Junior, Rudy Jose; Sartori, Gabriela] Univ Oeste Santa Catarina Brazil, Joacaba, SC, Brazil; [Fin, Gracielle] Univ Oeste Santa Catarina, Biociencias & Saude, Joacaba, SC, Brazil; [Omarini, Francesco; Bianco, Gianluca] Assoc Int Rieducaz Neuroposturale Psicocorporea, Rome, Italy; [Messina, Giuseppe; Traina, Marcello; Palma, Antonio] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Messina, Giuseppe] Posturalab Res Inst, Palermo, Italy; [Messina, Giuseppe] Univ Palermo, Unit Res, Sci & Posture, I-90133 Palermo, Italy","Messina, G (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",,"Fin, Gracielle/Q-3380-2017; Messina, Giuseppe/N-7298-2019","Fin, Gracielle/0000-0001-7860-4451; Messina, Giuseppe/0000-0003-2774-4950; Traina, Marcello/0000-0003-2373-3621",,,,24,3,3,0,8,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,4.0,,,,,1015.0,1019,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_125,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DY1XF,WOS:000384887000025,,,,,2022-07-14

Therefore, PE should be diagnosed in Emergency Care Units (ECU) at admission. Clinical algorithms support the clinician in this task, although performance is biased by differences in risk factors prevalent in different populations. The clinical conditions predictive of PE were evaluated in subjects from Southern Italy accessing ECU for dyspnea/chest pain. Methods: Retrospective clinical data were obtained by electronic retrieving from a hospital database. Data from 8177 patients (age 18-90 years, 54 with PE) were collected from years 2007-2013. Results: Previous history of PE, thrombosis and/or phlebitis, rheumatic diseases, respiratory failure, low blood pressure, pulse oxymetry rate (SpO(2)) and high heart rate were associated with PE diagnosis. High white blood count with neutrophilia, C reactive protein, D-dimer, NT-pro-BNP determinations, but not troponin T, were associated with PE. Recalibration of the GENEVA score and its modification, by inclusion of novel risk factors, improved the algorithm performance (GENEVA AROC=0.730, modified GENEVA AROC = 0.792, DeLong's test p = <0.001). Conclusions: PE risk factors in a large Sicilian sample are similar to those of other populations. Data from clinical history and clinical features present at admission were used to recalibrate the PE diagnostic algorithm showing that PE predictive power improved by fitting local data into the predictive model.","[Noto, Davide; Canino, Baldassare; Hopps, Eugenia; Giammanco, Antonina; Urso, Caterina; Cardella, Antonella; Averna, Maurizio R.] Univ Palermo, Dept Biomed Internal Med & Med Specialties DIBIMI, Via Vespro 129, I-90123 Palermo, Italy; [Paterno, Vincenzo; Fertitta, Emanuela] Hosp San Raffaele Giglio, Emergency Care Unit, Cefalu, Italy; [Tinaglia, Martino; Squatrito, Rosario] Hosp San Raffaele Giglio, Core Lab Unit, Cefalu, Italy; [Brocato, Francesco] Hosp San Raffaele Giglio, Engn & Informat Unit, Cefalu, Italy; [Vieni, Salvatore; Graceffa, Giuseppa] Univ Palermo, Dept Surg Oncol & Oral Sci, Palermo, Italy","Averna, MR (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Biomed Internal Med & Med Specialties DIBIMI, Via Vespro 129, I-90123 Palermo, Italy.",,"Averna, Maurizio/U-9527-2017; Noto, Davide/AAA-9208-2019; Giammanco, Antonina/AAA-8904-2019","Giammanco, Antonina/0000-0002-3088-3049; Averna, Maurizio/0000-0003-3558-9209",,,,22,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1857.0,1863,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_174,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300018,,,,,2022-07-14

Material and methods: Retrospective evaluation of consecutive patients that underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) during one year without symptoms or signs of carotid artery stenosis. The pre-operative Doppler ultrasonography in color and B-mode, using Siemens Accuson Antares machine, was used to determine the presence and the degree of carotid artery stenosis. Patients were divided according to the presence of significant (>= 50%) carotid artery stenosis. The same doctor performed all examinations. Following variables were analysed: age, gender, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, cholesterol, triglycerides and echocardiographic variables obtained from transthoracic echocardiography - the presence of aortic wall sclerosis, aortic valve sclerosis and mitral valve calcification. Results: We have demonstrated that in 18/272 (7.1%) of patients referred to CABG with hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenosis had asymptomatic stenosis. The risk of presence of carotid artery stenosis was more significant in those older than 60 years (OR 2.58 ;95% CI 0.98-6.77, p=0.047) and in patients with left main coronary artery stenosis (OR 8.92; 95% CI 3.2-24.83, p<0.001). Other investigated variables had no significant influence (p>0.05). Conclusion: The presence of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is strongly associated with the presence of left main coronary artery stenosis and with age older than 60 years.

There are several studies suggesting a possible relationship between musculoskeletal pain and vitamin D deficiency. In this study, we aimed to compare serum vitamin D levels between fibromyalgia patients and control groups and investigate the relationship between vitamin D and clinical findings on patients with fibromyalgia syndrome. Materials and methods: This case control study enrolled 79 women with fibromyalgia who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria and 80 healthy women. All subjects were evaluated with vitamin D and other biochemical markers. The patients were divided into three groups based on their serum vitamin D levels (normal, insufficient, deficient). Visual analogue scale and fibromyalgia impact questionnaire were used to evaluate the patients with FMS. Results: Mean serum vitamin D levels were lower in the FMS group than in the controls (12.99 +/- 8.37 ng/ml vs.16.05 +/- 9.42 ng/ml, p=0.037). Vitamin D level was significantly negative correlated with visual analogue scale, tender point count and fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (p=0.000, r=-0.578; p=0.001, r=-0.361; p=0.000, r=-0.621). Conclusion: It was concluded that vitamin D deficiency may be related to the clinical findings in patients with FMS.","[Okyay, Ramazanazim] Ceyhan Community Hlth Ctr, Adana, Turkey; [Kocyigit, Burhanfatih; Gursoy, Savas] Gaziantep Univ, Fac Med, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Gaziantep, Turkey","Kocyigit, B (corresponding author), Gaziantep Univ, Fac Med, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Gaziantep, Turkey.",,"ravegnini, gloria/K-1330-2016; Okyay, Ramazan Azim/AAC-5703-2020; Okyay, Ramazan A./C-9299-2016; Kocyigit, Burhan Fatih/AAX-4980-2021; Gursoy, Savas/AAH-3078-2020","ravegnini, gloria/0000-0002-7774-402X; Kocyigit, Burhan Fatih/0000-0002-6065-8002; Gursoy, Savas/0000-0002-1673-9905",,,,18,13,13,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,243.0,247,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700038,,,,,2022-07-14

However, there is no data on serum ferritin levels in patients with hepatitis D virus (HDV)-related cirrhosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether there are differences in serum ferritin levels among patients with HBV-related cirrhosis, HDV-related cirrhosis and healthy subjects. Materials and methods: Thirty-one patients with HBV-related cirrhosis, 33 patients with HDV-related cirrhosis, and 51 healthy controls were included in the study. Serum iron parameters including serum iron (SI), total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and ferritin were measured in these groups. Results: The average serum ferritin levels of patients with HDV-related cirrhosis, HBV-related cirrhosis and controls were 173.7 +/- 161.3, 168.2 +/- 165.1 and 86.3 +/- 58.4; respectively. The HBV-related cirrhosis and HDV-related cirrhosis groups had higher ferritin levels than the control group. However, there were no statistically significant differences between patients with HBV-related cirrhosis and control groups and HDV-related cirrhosis and HBV-related cirrhosis (all, p>0.05). On the contrary, comparison between HDV-related cirrhosis and control group was statistically significant (p=0.004). Conclusions: HBV and HDV-related cirrhosis patients had higher ferritin levels and lower total iron binding capacity (TIBC) than healthy controls. The presence of HDV-related cirrhosis affects serum ferritin levels. Therefore, increased ferritin levels may play a role in the pathogenesis HDV-related cirrhosis.","[Olmez, Sehmus] Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol, TR-65000 Van, Turkey; [Aslan, Mehmet] Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Van, Turkey; [Saritas, Bunyamin] Elazig Med Pk Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Elazig, Turkey; [Yalcin, Mehmet Suat; Tas, Adnan] Adana Numune Res & Educ Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Adana, Turkey; [Balaharoglu, Ragip] Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Fac Med, Dept Clin Biochem, Van, Turkey","Olmez, S (corresponding author), Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol, TR-65000 Van, Turkey.",,"Olmez, Sehmus/ABG-1212-2020; Tas, Adnan/ABF-7933-2020; Sarıtaş, Bünyamin/K-9920-2015","Olmez, Sehmus/0000-0002-7288-3936; Tas, Adnan/0000-0002-5706-2136; Sarıtaş, Bünyamin/0000-0003-0957-7001",,,,55,1,1,1,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1813.0,1819,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_168,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300012,,,,,2022-07-14

Studies revealed different results about effects of vitamin D receptor activators (VDRAs) on OPG levels. This study investigated the changes in serum OPG levels and its relationships following VDRAs, paricalcitol and calcitriol treatments, in hemodialysis patients. Materials and methods: Thirty-two hemodialysis patients (14 women, 18 men) were included the study. Demographics and ongoing treatments of patients were recorded. Paricalcitol and calcitriol treatments were initiated randomly. Serum OPG levels, biochemical and hematological tests were measured at baseline and 3th month of the treatment. Results: There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of demographics and basal laboratory tests. No difference was found between paricalcitol and calcitriol groups regarding change from baseline and percent change in biochemical markers and OPG levels. Significant increase in calcium (Ca) levels (p=0.025 vs 0.001), significant decreases in parathyroid hormone (PTH) (p=0.001 vs 0.039) and OPG (p=0.001 vs 0.006) levels were noted at 3th month compared to baseline in paricalcitol and calcitriol group. Conclusion: VDRAs, paricalcitol and calcitriol, both decreased OPG levels in hemodialysis patients. No difference was noted between two therapeutic agents regarding their effects on OPG levels. These findings should be confirmed by further large-scale studies.","[Oruc, Aysegul; Yildiz, Abdulmecit; Bal, Oznur; Korkmaz, Serhat; Gullulu, Mustafa] Uludag Univ, Sch Med, Div Nephrol, Bursa, Turkey; [Gul, Cuma Bulent] Sevket Yilmaz Training & Res Hosp, Div Nephrol, Bursa, Turkey; [Aktas, Nimet] Cekirge State Hosp, Bursa, Turkey","Oruc, A (corresponding author), Uludag Univ, Sch Med, Dept Nephrol, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey.",,"Gul, Cuma/A-7063-2018; Oruc, Aysegul/AAH-4002-2021; BAL, OZNUR/D-4160-2016","Gul, Cuma/0000-0003-2467-9356; ",,,,23,1,1,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,325.0,329,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000008,,,,,2022-07-14

Seeking factors associated with IDH may provide clinically relevant information. Materials and method: We enrolled a total of 103 patients receiving thrice-weekly HD. Besides hemodynamic and laboratory parameters, we evaluated nutritional status, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Results: Female subjects had a significantly higher rate of IDH compared to males (42.6% vs. 14.9%, p=0.003). Older patients (>= 65 years old) tended to have a higher rate of IDH compared to those younger than 65 years, but the difference was not statistically significant (31% vs. 21%, p=0.2). Univariate correlation analysis revealed gender, orthostatism, history of falls, dialysis duration, fasting glucose, albumin, and potassium levels to be correlated with IDH. Logistic regression analysis revealed that higher potassium level was the only independent factor in association with IDH. Conclusion: We observed an independent association between higher predialysis potassium levels and IDH. Further studies are needed to confirm this association and to see if measures to control predialysis potassium levels better would translate into a decreased rate of IDH in these patients.","[Oruc, Aysegul; Yildiz, Abdulmecit; Sahin, Ahmet Bilgehan] Uludag Univ, Sch Med, Div Nephrol, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey; [Yildiz, Demet; Gul, Cuma Bulent] Sevket Yilmaz Training & Res Hosp, Div Nephrol, Bursa, Turkey; [Cimen, Dogan] Rentip Private Dialysis Ctr, Bursa, Turkey; [Aktas, Nimet] Cekirge State Hosp, Bursa, Turkey; [Tufan, Fatih] Istanbul Univ, Sch Med, Div Geriatr, Istanbul, Turkey","Oruc, A (corresponding author), Uludag Univ, Sch Med, Dept Nephrol, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey.",,"Oruc, Aysegul/AAH-4002-2021; Tufan, Fatih/CAF-4137-2022; Gul, Cuma/A-7063-2018; Şahin, Ahmet Bilgehan/AAM-4927-2020","Gul, Cuma/0000-0003-2467-9356; Şahin, Ahmet Bilgehan/0000-0002-7846-0870",,,,13,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,713.0,717,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_79,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400008,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: Hospital records of 250 patients who were operated and diagnosed as thyroid papillary carcinoma according to pathology report between 2000-2007 in Ankara Oncology Hospital were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Among the 250 paitents who were diagnosed with thyroid papillary carcinoma and followed 1025 mounts in average, multicentricity was identified in the 43.2% of the patients. Multicentricity was detected in 57.1% (32 patients) of the 56 patients who had follicular variant of thyroid papillary carcinoma which was detected in their pathology report. In comparison with other subgroups, multicentricity was seen in a higher statistical rate in follicular variant. However, a statistically significant relation between them could not be founded (p:0.06). Among the 13 multicentric patients, vascular invasion was seen in 10 patients (76.9%) and there was a statistical correlation (p<0.05). Although multicentricity was seen in 46.8% (36 patients) of the 78 patients with lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis, there was not a statistical correlation. 34 patients had recurrence and multicentricity was seen in 19 of them (55.9%) with no statistical relation. Moreover, no correlation of multicentricty with general survival and disease-free survival was found. Discussion: Multicentricity characterized with high recurrence rate and lymph node metastasis should be accepted as a bad prognostic factor and in this situation aggressive treatment protocol should be used.","[Ozcelik, Kazim Caglar; Zihni, Ismail; Karakose, Oktay; Pulat, Huseyin] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Med, Dept Surg Oncol, TR-32200 Isparta, Turkey; [Ulucanlar, Haluk; Turanli, Sevim] Ankara Oncol Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Ankara, Turkey; [Calta, Alpaslan Fedai] Bandirma State Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Balikesir, Turkey; [Eken, Huseyin] Mengucek Gazi Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Erzincan, Turkey","Karakose, O (corresponding author), Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Med, Dept Surg Oncol, TR-32200 Isparta, Turkey.",,"özçelik, kazım çağlar/AAI-1386-2020",,,,,14,1,1,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,209.0,212,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700032,,,,,2022-07-14

Chlamydia infection during pregnancy poses major health risks for both pregnant women and their fetuses. Most of the individuals who are infected by C. trachomatis are asymptomatic. This treatable disease can be detected easily and more precisely thanks to new developing diagnostic technologies. Application of screening programs in which highly sensitive methods such as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) could be beneficial in asymptomatic populations. Materials and methods: Genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection prevalence in asymptomatic Turkish women, who presented for initial prenatal visit or preconception visit at Anadolu Medical Center in western part of Turkey (Istanbul), between 2006 and 2011, was investigated by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Endocervical specimens collected from 541 women during their vaginal examination were analyzed by COBAS Amplicor Chlamydia trachomatis test. Two hundred fifty nine women were tested during the first visit of their pregnancy, while 282 women were tested during preconception visit. The median age of the women was 30 years, range 16 to 45 years. Results: Totally 1.85% (n= 10) of the patients were positive. Of the positive patients, 20% (n= 2) were pregnant, while 80% (n= 8) were in preconception period. Genital Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence was determined as 1.85% in asymptomatic Turkish women population. Conclusion: Chlamydia trachomatis screening in asymptomatic sexually active women should be performed by highly sensitive NAAT tests. Screening of women in reproductive age may reduce major health risks for pregnant women and their newborns; further investigations that will contribute diagnosis of the disease and the determination of national strategies should be performed.","[Ozdamar, Melda; Turkoglu, Salih] Anadolu Med Ctr, Dept Microbiol, Cumhuriyet Mah St 2255,3, TR-41400 Gebze, Turkey; [Saglam, Filiz Yarimcam] Bahcesehir Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Gucer, Fatih] Anadolu Med Ctr, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Kocaeli, Turkey; [Donat, Ebru Fusun] Acibadem Hosp, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Bursa, Turkey","Ozdamar, M (corresponding author), Anadolu Med Ctr, Dept Microbiol, Cumhuriyet Mah St 2255,3, TR-41400 Gebze, Turkey.",,"Sozen, Ibrahim/AAN-5086-2021","SOZEN, IBRAHIM/0000-0003-3478-0124",,,,21,0,0,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,4.0,,,,,1009.0,1013,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_124,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DY1XF,WOS:000384887000024,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and method: This study was retrospectively conducted in 776 patients admitted to intensive care unit between 01.01.2013 and 31.12.2013. Age, sex, clinical diagnosis, comorbid conditions, RDW levels at intensive care admission and discharge, duration of intensive care stay, and mortality rate were evaluated. Kolmogorov Smirnov, student t-test, Mann Whithey u test, and Chi-square test were used for data analysis. The results were provided at a confidence interval of 95% and a significance level of p<0.05. Results: Conducted on 776 patients in Ankara Numune Hospital's general intensive care clinic 3, this study revealed a mortality rate of 38.2%. The mean age of the study population was 65.4+/-18.3 years, with the deceased patients having a greater mean age (p<0.05). Four hundred and thirteen (53.2%) patients were male, and there was no significant difference between the ratios of both genders (p>0.05). The deceased patients had significantly increasing RDW levels whereas the surviving patients had significantly reducing RDW levels (p<0.05). There was a significant correlation between the magnitude of RDW increment and duration of hospital stay in the deceased patients (p<0.05).

Resistance of these bacteria against to antibiotics, in particular is emerging as a very significant in intensive care units. The factors which affect the increase in resistance to antimicrobial drugs are the high probability of encountering antimicrobial resistant microorganisms and empiric antimicrobial treatment. Materials and methods: The bacterial culture results of clinical specimens sent to Microbiology Laboratory of Mustafa Kemal University Hospital in five year period were examined retrospectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacteria of genus Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from these specimens were analyzed. The antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter strains isolated from ICUs and those isolated from other clinics was compared. Results: In five-year period, 772 P. aeruginosa and 971 Acinetobacter spp. were isolated from the specimens. Twenty-three percent of P. aeruginosa strains and 49.3% of Acinetobacter spp. were isolated from the patients in intensive care units. 628 (64.7%) of Acinetobacter and 92 (11.9%) of P. aeruginosa strains were found to be Multidrug Resistant (MDR). The ratios of multidrug-resistance in Acinetobacter strains isolated from the patients in ICUs were found to be higher than those in P. aeruginosa strains isolated from the patients in intensive care units. MDR ratio of these bacteria isolated in ICUs was higher than that isolated in the other clinics. Conclusion: Acinetobacter strains isolated from the patients in ICUs were determined to be more resistant than those isolated from the patients in other clinics while Pseudomonas strains isolated from the other clinics, were more resistant than those isolated from the patients hospitalized in ICUs.

It causes fluid and electrolyte loss, increases the workload of nurses, and prolongs the duration of hospitalization. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the incidence and risk factors associated with nosocomial diarrhea in adult patients treated in intensive care unit (ICU). Materials and methods: Records of 786 adult patients treated in the ICU between January 2004 and May 2009 were inspected retrospectively. Loose or watery stools occurring three times a day and more was considered as diarrhea. The control group included those patients who were treated in ICU at the same time as the patients with diarrhea, with similar demographic and clinic features. Results: It was established that of 786 patients, 78 (9.92%) developed diarrhea. The time lapse between admission to the ICU and the onset of diarrhea was 12.41 +/- 21.7 days, and the duration of diarrhea was 438 +/- 2.13 days. Compared to the control's (n=80), the rate of enteral feeding was higher in patients with diarrhea, enteral nutrition products of high concentration, proton pump inhibitors, medications containing sorbitol and Mg+2, clindamycin, and cephalosporins were used significantly more often (p=0.002, p=0.006, p=0.048, p=0.006, p=0.033, p=0.048). Furthermore, the length of stay in ICU was longer in these patients (p=0.043). Clostridium difficile toxin was determined to be positive in 11 patients with diarrhea (14.1%). These cases were older and had a longer ICU stay and duration of diarrhea (p=0.031, p=0.027, p=0.004). Conclusion: It was found that the patients with diarrhea had a high enteral nutrition infusion rate, and products concentration, a high level of drug usage such as proton pump inhibitors, antibiotics, and sorbitol, and a low albumin level. Nosoconzial diarrhea could also prolong the length of ICU stay in critically ill patients.","[Ozgur, Mustafa; Girgin, Nermin Kelebek; Kahveci, Ferda] Uludag Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anaesthesiol & Reanimat, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey; [Iscimen, Remzi; Sinirtas, Melda] Uludag Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Infect Dis, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey","Girgin, NK (corresponding author), Uludag Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anaesthesiol & Reanimat, TR-16059 Bursa, Turkey.",,"Akalin, Halis/AAU-8952-2020; Girgin, Nermin Kelebek/AAH-7250-2019; Kahveci, Ferda/AAG-9356-2021; ISCIMEN, REMZI/AAI-8104-2021","ISCIMEN, REMZI/0000-0001-8111-5958; Kahveci, Ferda Sohret/0000-0003-4820-2288",,,,29,1,1,1,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,741.0,746,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_83,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400012,,,,,2022-07-14

There has been growing evidence that the Mediterranean diet plays a role in medical nutrition therapy. This study aimed to determine the effects of the Mediterranean diet on the estimated 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetics. Materials and methods: This trial is an open, nonrandomized clinical trial. Participants consumed a Mediterranean diet for 12 weeks. The cardiovascular disease risk score of each individual was calculated before and after the dietary intervention, without any change in his or her medical treatments throughout the study. Results: A total of 254 patients were screened. Thirty-two patients were excluded from the study before and 20 patients after the dietary intervention. Therefore, 202 patients completed the study. We obtained a significant reduction in cardiovascular disease risk score of 245 +/- 3.6% in men and 20.0 +/- 3.5% in women (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates the efficacy of the Mediterranean diet for reducing cardiovascular diseases risk in type 2 diabetics in 12 weeks.","[Ozkaya, Ismail] Kirklareli Univ, Hlth Sch, Dept Nutr & Dietet, Kirklareli, Turkey; [Bicer, Emine Kir] Beykent Univ, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Nursing, Istanbul, Turkey; [Yardimci, Bulent] Istanbul Florence Nightingale Hosp, Div Internal Med, Dept Internal Med, Istanbul, Turkey; [Tunckale, Aydin] Istanbul Bilim Univ, Div Gen Internal Med, Dept Internal Med, Istanbul, Turkey","Ozkaya, I (corresponding author), Kirklareli Univ, Hlth Sch, Dept Nutr & Dietet, Kirklareli, Turkey.",,"BICER, Emine KIR/ABG-7528-2020","BICER, Emine KIR/0000-0002-4773-9393",,,,39,1,1,1,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,255.0,261,,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700040,,,,,2022-07-14

The prevalence of SCS is reported as between approximately 5% and 24% in patients with adrenal incidentalomas (AI). SCS has increased cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, and metabolic syndrome. Recently some studies demonstrated oxidative stress enhancement in Cushing's disease. Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) is a marker of ischemia and oxidative stress and is increased in different clinical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome. However, it has not been investigated in the patients with SCS. We aimed to evaluate serum IMA levels in the patients with SCS. Materials and methods: A total of 128 patients with AI were included in this study (17 patients with SCS and 111 patients with non-functional adenomas (NFA)). All patients were evaluated for the presence of adrenal masses using adrenal computed tomography (CT) scans. Serum IMA levels were measured by using a calorimetric method. Results: Serum IMA levels were significantly higher in SCS patients than in NFA patients (p < 0.05). Serum IMA was significantly correlated with waist circumference, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and SCS. Furthermore, regression analysis revealed that serum IMA levels are independent and positively associated only with SCS. Conclusion: We concluded that elevated serum IMA levels might be accepted as a useful marker in patients with SCS. In order to reveal the pathological role of IMA levels in patients with SCS more studies are required.","[Ozku, Faruk] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, TR-17100 Canakkale, Turkey; [Turkon, Hakan; Cakir, Dilek Ulker; Tutunculer, Funda Kirtay] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Biochem, TR-17100 Canakkale, Turkey; [Eroglu, Mustafa; Ukinc, Kubilay; Asik, Mehmet] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Med, Dept Endocrinol, TR-17100 Canakkale, Turkey; [Eroglu, Mustafa; Ukinc, Kubilay; Asik, Mehmet] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Med, Dept Metab, TR-17100 Canakkale, Turkey; [Faydaci, Umut] Near East Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, Nicosia, Cyprus","Turkon, H (corresponding author), Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Biochem, TR-17100 Canakkale, Turkey.",,"Eroğlu, Mustafa/AAC-1081-2020","Eroğlu, Mustafa/0000-0002-7526-7151",,,,17,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,463.0,467,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000031,,,,,2022-07-14

However, in clinical practice, patients are occasionally diagnosed with PTE despite normal D-dieter levels. In the present study, we reviewed the characteristics of cases in an emergency department (ED) in which a diagnosis of PTE was made despite normal D-dimer test results. Materials and methods: The hospital records of 107 patients who were admitted to the ED of a teaching hospital and diagnosed with PTE between January 2011 and December 2013 were reviewed retrospectively. We acquired data for 11 patients (10.2%) in whom D-dimer measurements obtained by an automated latex turbidimetric quantitative method were below 500 ng/ml (0-450). Results: Of the 11 patients, 72.7% (8/11) were female, and mean age was 71. +/- 57.9 (61-84) years. The most common symptom was dyspnea (54.5%, n=6). The mean delay between onset of symptoms and admission to the ED was 10.6 (3-30) days, and follow-ups were performed for patients in other health facilities for various causes of dyspnea. When risk factors were analyzed with the Wells score, 18.2% (2/11) of patients had low probability of PTE, whereas 72.7% (8/11) had intermediate, and 9% (1/11) had high probability. According to the revised Geneva score, 18.2% (2/11) of patients were found to have low probability, and 81.8% (9/11) had intermediate probability. The Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index score classified 18.2% (2/11) of the patients in the low risk group, and the European Society of Cardiology classification classified 81.8% (9/11) in the low risk group. Conclusion: In patients with nonspecific symptoms of PTE, the delay between onset of symptoms and admission to the ED is important. The risk factors of the patients and their pre-test probabilities should be considered along with D-dieter test results.","[Ozlem, Bilir; Gokhan, Ersunan; Asim, Kalkan; Ozcan, Yavasi; Kamil, Kayayurt] Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Fac Med, Dept Emergency Med, TR-53200 Rize, Turkey; [Baris, Giakoup] Rize State Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Rize, Turkey","Ozlem, B (corresponding author), Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Fac Med, Dept Emergency Med, TR-53200 Rize, Turkey.",,"Kalkan, Asim/AAE-3280-2020; YAVASI, OZCAN/AFP-3972-2022; Kalkan, Asim/AAF-3504-2019; Yavaşi, Özcan/AFQ-6296-2022","Kalkan, Asim/0000-0002-5800-0201; YAVASI, OZCAN/0000-0001-8641-7031; ",,,,26,1,1,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,171.0,177,,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700027,,,,,2022-07-14

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between PLR and lesion localization of left anterior descending artery (LAD) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Materials and methods: Patients admitted to our hospital with acute anterior STEMI were included. 58 patients who have single-vessel disease at LAD and their hematological parameters were analyzed retrospectively. Proximal segment of LAD lesions were groupped as Group I and mid segment of the LAD lesion groupped as Group II. The groups were compared according to their PLR and other parameters. Results: Between group I (n = 41, mean age 52.5 +/- 12.7) and group 11 (n = 17, mean ages 52.0 +/- 10.8); PLR, was significantly higher in group I (159 +/- 99 vs 99.5 +/- 37.5 p < 0.05). In group I, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly lower (P = 0.02). In correlation analyzes, PLR was positively correlated with Troponin I (r = 0.30, P = 0.03) and negatively correlated with LVEF (r= - 0.27, P = 0.04) Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that anterior STEMI patients with high PLR had a greater possibility having proximal culprit lesion on the LAD. Therefore PLR can be used as a useful tool to detect not only significant atherosclerosis but also culprit plaque localization in patients with acute STEMI patients.","[Ozluk, Ozlem Arican; Yilmaz, Mustafa; Tenekecioglu, Erhan; Peker, Tezcan; Kanat, Selcuk; Karaagac, Kemal; Vatansever, Fahriye; Yagcioglu, Pinar] Bursa Ihtisas Training & Res Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Bursa, Turkey; [Topal, Dursun] Sevket Yilmaz Training & Res Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Bursa, Turkey","Ozluk, OA (corresponding author), Bursa Yuksek Ihtisas Egitim & Arastirma Hastanesi, Kardiyol Klin, Yildirim Bursa, Turkey.",,"TENEKECIOGLU, ERHAN/M-2810-2019","TENEKECIOGLU, ERHAN/0000-0003-4376-2833",,,,30,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,331.0,336,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000009,,,,,2022-07-14

The incidence is approximately 10% during the lifetime. Although appendectomy is a most common surgical procedure worldwide, it's complication rate is 5-28% A delay in diagnosis of AA is associated with prolonged hospitalization, an increased rate of perforation (34%-75%), wound infection (0%-11%), pelvic abscess (1%-5%) and late intro-abdominal adhesions. Appendectomy is first described by McBurney in 1894 and still remains the standart procedure for AA. Although patients with AA often present with a characteristic symptom complex and physical findings, atypical presentations are common. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients who were operated for suspected acute appendicitis and to assess the discriminative effect of this ratio between wzinflamed, uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis. Materials and methods: The medical records of 3212 patients who underwent appendectomy for suspected acute appendicitis during a 10-year period were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were divided into 3 groups; group 1, 208 consecutive patients who had uninflamed appendix at appendectomy; group 2, 2111 consecutive patients who had uncomplicated acute appendicitis at appendectomy; group 3, 893 patients who had complicated appendicitis (perforated appendix or peri-appendicular abscess) at appendectomy. Data for three groups of patients were analyzed to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the NLR in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Receivers operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate this ratio in a relation with true diagnosis and severity of acute appendicitis. Results: 1792 (55.8%) of the patients were male and 1420 (44.2%) of them were female. The mean age of the groups were 30.28 +/- 14.18, 29.98 +/- 12.63 and 33.81 +/- 16.27 respectively. The discriminative effect of NLR was higher between uninflamed and complicated appendicitis groups with a cut-off value of 3,94. The recommended cut-off value of the preoperative NLR was decided using ROC curve analyses. The recommended cut-off value of the NLR was based on the most prominent point on the ROC curve for sensitivity (82.2%) and specificity (56.5%). The area under the ROC curve was 0.74. Conclusion: AA is one of the most common surgical emergencies and the most common source of infection in community acquired intra-abdominal infections. However the diagnosis is often challenging and the decision to operate, observe or further work-up on a patient is often unclear. Initial management of patients with suspected AA is based on the history of the patient, physical examination, basic laboratory tests reflecting the inflammatory response and radiologic imaging. NLR is a helpful biochemical parameter for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis but it has limited value on differentiating patients with complicated appendicitis from patients with uninflamed and uncomplicated appendicitis.","[Ozturk, S.; Unver, M.; Yoldas, O.] Izmir Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, Izmir, Turkey; [Dizen, H.] Eskisehir Yunus Emre State Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Eskisehir, Turkey; [Erol, V] Baskent Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, Ankara, Turkey; [Bozbiyik, O.] Ege Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, Izmir, Turkey; [Guner, M.; Pehlivanoglu, K.; Kebapci, B.; Aydin, C.; Akbulut, G.] Tepecik Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Izmir, Turkey","Ozturk, S (corresponding author), Yeni Girne Bulvari 1825 Sokak 12, Karsiyaka Izmir, Turkey.",,"Aydin, Cengiz/AAL-6664-2020; Ünver, Mutlu/AAA-1673-2021","Aydin, Cengiz/0000-0003-4713-2871; Guner, Murat/0000-0002-3463-8550",,,,42,0,0,0,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,799.0,804,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_93,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400022,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: Eighty positive and 20 negative human sera to Brucella Serum Tube Agglutination Test were used for determination of NO, TOC-TAC, CRP, AST, ALT. Results: Serum TOC concentrations were significantly (P<0.01) higher in Brucella seropositive titers compared to Brucella seronegative serum samples regardless of titers. However, there was no difference among different seropositive titers for serum TOC concentrations. In contrast, no effect of Brucella antibody titers on serum NO, TAC, CRP, AST and ALT levels was proved. However, AST concentration tended to be (P<0.07) higher at 1/640 titer. While Brucella antibody titers decreased leukocyte (P<0.05) and increased erythrocyte (P<0.05) counts at 1/640 titers with no change at 11160 and 1/320 titers, no effect of Brucella antibody titers was detected on thrombocyte counts. There was a positive correlation between Brucella antibody titers and TOC (r=0,44; P<0,01), AST (r=0,23; P=0,05) levels and erythrocyte counts (r=0,32; P<0,01); whereas, there was a negative correlation between Brucella antibody titers and leukocyte counts (r=-0.32; P<0,01). Conclusion: The increase in TOC levels and steady state levels of TAC could reveal that antioxidant system was efficient during the course of brucellosis. Furthermore, determination of TOC/TAC system along with hematological and inflammatory parameters may be helpful monitoring and better understanding the pathogenesis of brucellosis.","[Pancarci, Berrin] Kafkas Univ, Inst Hlth Sci, Dept Microbiol, Kars, Turkey; [Unver, Ahmet] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Canakkale, Turkey; [Cetinkol, Yeliz] Ordu Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Ordu, Turkey; [Atakisi, Onur] Kafkas Univ, Fac Sci & Literature, Dept Biochem, Kars, Turkey","Pancarci, B (corresponding author), Ataturk Mesleki & Teknik Anadolu Lisesi, Ataturk Mah Gunes Sok 1-1, Karesi, Balikesir, Turkey.",,,"Atakisi, Onur/0000-0003-1183-6076",,,,32,2,2,0,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,69.0,73,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700010,,,,,2022-07-14

CP remarkably influences the life of those affected and their families. For this reason it is important and necessary to direct attention not only type of the CP, but also the impact the disorder has on the child, parents, siblings and the entire family as a whole. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of CP on the child's quality of life, considering parents' perceptions about their child's illness, in order to underline the impact the illness has not only on the child but also his/her family. Methods: The study included both parents of the 36 subjects enrolled (19 males and 17 females), with established CP diagnosis. The effect of CP on the families was assessed using the Impact of Childhood Illness Scale. This questionnaire assesses the quality of life in children with epilepsy and other chronic pathologies and in their families. All questions refer to effect to the illness family. The scale comprises 30 questions divided into four sections: impact of illness and its treatment; impact on development and child s adjustment; impact on parents and impact on the family. Descriptive analyses were used for data analysis and it is also calculated the rank correlation coefficient Spearman's rho. Results and conclusion: The mothers' group presents little higher average scores than the group of fathers in two four subscales or in the basement Impact on the child and Family impact on the organization. This could be due to the fact that mothers are concerned most of the child's caregiver, living most of all the difficulties that entails; mothers show greater concerns than fathers. In subscale Impact on parents the average score of the answers of the group of mothers coincide with that of the fathers; the experience and the experience of his son's illness is analogous for both parents. No significant differences were found from the correlational analysis between the individual items of the subscales and the different forms of CP. In families of children with CP, strategies for optimizing caregiver physical and psychological health include supports for behavioral management and daily functional activities as well as stress management and self-efficacy techniques.","[Parisi, Lucia; Di Filippo, Teresa; Russotto, Carmen; Maltese, Agata; Roccella, Michele] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Ruberto, Maria] Univ Naples 2, Dept Med Surg & Dent Specialties, Caserta, CE, Italy; [Precenzano, Francesco] Univ Naples 2, Dept Mental & Phys Hlth & Prevent Med, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Caserta, CE, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, I-90133 Palermo, Italy","Roccella, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",,,"Precenzano, Francesco/0000-0002-3812-1786",,,,39,11,11,0,17,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_147,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000018,,,,,2022-07-14

Platelets modulate immune and inflammatory processes in the skin. Platelets are indicated with PCT which is produced of PLT and the MPV and reflects total platelet mass. PCT is found as a marker that shows platelet activity. PCT is associated with severity of inflammation in some diseases. NLR and PLR in venous blood are increased in systemic inflammatory responses. We aimed to investigate the association between Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and platelet indices including plateletcrit (PCT), the value of platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV) and the value of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Materials methods: A total of 172 patients with psoriasis and 128 healthy controls were included in the study. Age, sex, PCT, PLR, NLR, PASI, PLT, neutrophil count (NC) and lymphocyte count (LC), MPV, lipid profile of the patients were recorded. We measured the severity of skin disease using PASI. Results: When compared with controls, patients with psoriasis had higher PCT, platelet count, MPV, PLR and NLR. We observed significant association between the presence of psoriasis and PCT, NLR, MPV. There were significant differences between platelet indices including PLT, PCT, MPV, PLR in the severe and moderate groups. PASI was positively correlated with PCT, MPV and PLR. In ROC analysis, PCT value greater than 0.321 predicted psoriasis with 55% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Using binary logistic regression analysis, we found that PCT, especially those values > 0.321, were independent predictors of psoriasis (OR= 2.810, 95% Cl= 1.28-3.33, p= 0.000). Conclusion: PCT value should be used as a predictor for precense of psoriasis. It could also be highlighted that PCT is a noninvasive, easily available marker and so it can be used in predicting patients with psoriasis.","[Pektas, Suzan Demir; Alatas, Emine Tugba] Mugla Sitki Kocman Univ, Fac Med, Dept Dermatol, TR-48000 Mugla, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Nigar] Mugla Sitki Kocman Univ, Fac Med, Dept Biochem, Mugla, Turkey","Pektas, SD (corresponding author), Mugla Sitki Kocman Univ, Fac Med, Dept Dermatol, TR-48000 Mugla, Turkey.",,"Alatas, Emine Tugba/I-8162-2019","Alatas, Emine Tugba/0000-0002-5727-9474",,,,29,8,8,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1785.0,1790,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_164,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300008,,,,,2022-07-14

It has been observed that, during the performance of a maximal exercise, in the central nervous system (CNS) increases the use of lactate and glucose. Moreover; it has been described that during a maximal exercise the increase of blood lactate is associated with a worsening of attentive processes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether high levels of Lactate are capable of influencing other cognitive domains as Short-term memory. Materials and methods: Fifteen male and healthy athletes participated in the research. Short-term memory span was carried through the Italian computerized version of Wechsler's Digit Span. The subjects were asked to perform an incremental cycling test on a mechanically braked cycloergometer. The measurement of values of blood lactate and the assessment of Short-term memory through the Italian computerized version of Wechsler's Digit Span were performed in three specific moments: 1) at rest (before); 2) immediately after performing an exhaustive exercise (end); 3) 10 minutes after the end of the exercise (10 min). Results: Blood lactate levels increased ftom 1.5 mmol/l (+/- 0.21) at rest (pre), to 12.0 mmol/l (+/- 2.14) immediately after the exercise (end), and decreased to 1.6 mmol/l (+/- 0.21) 10 min after its conclusion (post). In parallel, we observed that the digit span shows a worsening of short term memory at the end of exercised and returned to the pre-exercise values within 10 min after the conclusion of exercise. Conclusion: The present results show that high levels of blood lactate, as those induced with an exhaustive exercise, influence the cognitive domain of the memory in the same way observed for the cognitive domain of attention.","[Perciavalle, Valentina] Univ Catania, Dept Format Proc, I-95124 Catania, Italy; [Buscemi, Andrea; Borbone, Carlo; Catania, Andrea; Petralia, Maria Cristina; Puglisi, Maria Luisa; Coco, Lucio S.

Recently, some researchers have suggested that the underlying epileptogenic mechanism of absence seizures selectively involves the frontal cortical circuits, also supported by video-electroencephalography data(3). These data may be considered as a new window in CAE comprehension and management, particularly about symptoms different from seizure that children affected may present. In this light, aim of the present study is evaluating the presence of internalizing problems in prepubertal children affected by CAE. Material and methods: 18 patients (10 females, 8 males) ranging age from 8-11 years (mean age 9.36 +/- 1.32) affected by typical CAE were recruited. Control group was composed by 43 subjects (32 females, 11 males) (mean age 8.54 +/- 2.01). All subjects were screened for internalizing symptoms with SAFA-A scale and CDI test. Results: The two groups were comparable for age (p= 0.117) and sex distribution (p= 0.251). CAE children showed significantly higher score than controls for anxiety (p< 0.001) and depressive symptoms screening tests (p< 0.001) (Table 1). Conclusions: Results of present study suggest the importance of screening for anxiety and depressive signs in CAE children, in order to optimize their management beyond the exclusive idea to control and stop epileptic seizure only.","[Precenzano, Francesco; Lombardi, Paola; D'Alessandro, Ilaria; Della Valle, Immacolata; Magliulo, Rosaria Martina] Univ Naples 2, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Caserta Ce, Italy; [Precenzano, Francesco; Lombardi, Paola; D'Alessandro, Ilaria; Della Valle, Immacolata; Magliulo, Rosaria Martina] Univ Naples 2, Dept Mental Hlth & Phys & Prevent Med, Headache Ctr Children & Adolescents, Caserta Ce, Italy; [Ruberto, Maria] Univ Naples 2, Dept Med Surg & Dent Specialties, Caserta Ce, Italy; [Parisi, Lucia; Maltese, Agata; Roccella, Michele] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Parisi, Lucia; Maltese, Agata; Roccella, Michele] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Foggia, Sect Human Physiol, Dept Expt Med, Foggia, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Foggia, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Unit Dietet & Sports Med, Foggia, Italy","Roccella, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",,"Messina, Giovanni/AAE-8668-2022","Messina, Giovanni/0000-0002-0011-867X",,,,50,13,13,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1749.0,1753,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_158,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300002,,,,,2022-07-14

This study aims to study the effect of aflatoxin genes aflPand aflQ on aflatoxigenic species of A. flavus and A. parasiticus in cattle feed. To conduct the study, 121 samples of cattle feed were collected and then were isolated and cultured based on macroscopic and microscopic methods. Moreover, PCR technique was also used to undertake a molecular examination of the isolated Aspergillus. To identify the aflatoxigenic species, 10 Aspergillus fungi, containing one or two positive aflatoxin genes were randomly selected and examined under the ultraviolet light. Finally, their aflatoxin content was evaluated based on High Performance Liquid Chromatography. The results indicate that 55.37% of 121 samples of the cattle feeds contaminated by Aspergillus fungi. Among these isolated samples, 67.16% has aflP and 70.14% has aflQ, and the findings of HPLC also confirms that aflatoxigenic isolates are more common than their non-aflatoxigenic counterparts. Among 10 species of A. flavus and A. parasiticus collected from cattle feeds, wheat bran produced the highest amount of aflatoxin, in which aflatoxin B1 accounted for the highest amount and aflatoxins G1 and G2 accounted for the least amount. It is noteworthy that aflatoxin B1 was produced in all species while aflatoxin G2 was not produced. Aflatoxins B2 and G1 were produced in all species of A. parasiticus and some species of A. flavus. Controlling cattle feeds contaminated by Aspergillus fungi can secure them against aflatoxin contamination and prevent them from entering the human and animal health cycle.","[Rahimi, Sepideh; Sohrabi, Noshin; Ebrahimi, Mohammad Ali] PNU, Dept Plant Biotechnol, POB 19395, Tehran 3697, Iran; [Tebyanian, Majid; Zadeh, Morteza Taghi] Razi Vaccine & Serum Res Inst, Dept Res & Dev, Karaj, Iran; [Rahimi, Sahar] Islamic Azad Univ, Pharmaceut Sci branch, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Tehran, Iran","Rahimi, S (corresponding author), Payam Noor Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Plant Biotechnol, Tehran Shargh Branch, Tehran, Iran.",,"Ebrahimi, Mohammad Ali/AFL-4657-2022","Ebrahimi, Mohammad Ali/0000-0002-2610-9018",,,,33,2,2,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,5.0,,2091.0,2100,,,,10,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YW,WOS:000392283800034,,,,,2022-07-14

The objective of this study was to analyze all components of the metabolic syndrome in subjects with increased waist circumference, with the hypothesis that even in normal weighted apparently healthy subjects the metabolic profile is already modified. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between February 2013 and April 2014. The sample consisted of 266 consecutive patients presenting to the Endocrinology Outpatient Clinic of the Emergency Mures County Hospital for consultation who signed the informed consent. Inclusion criteria - waist circumference above 80cm for females and >94cm for males. Exclusion criteria - secondary causes of increased abdominal circumference: pregnancy, generalized edema, endocrine causes: untreated hypo-or hyperthyroidism, Cushing syndrome, medications that could lead to weight gain/loss, weight losing diet and refusal to participate. For all patients, height, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure were measured by the same person. Venous blood samples were taken for determination of fasting blood glucose, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. Microsoft Office Excel was used for data collection and GraphPad Prism v. 5 for statistical analysis, with a level of significance alpha=0.05. Results: Mean age of the sample was 51 +/- 12.7 years with a median of 53 years and a sex ratio F:M of 8.1:1. The normal weighted subjects had a high prevalence of associated disturbances (34.41% hypertriglyceridemia, 37.63% low HDL cholesterol, 29.03% increased blood glucose and 44.09% hypertension). Metabolically healthy obese represented 17.29% (n=46) of the sample. When comparing the metabolically healthy subjects with abdominal obesity to the metabolically unhealthy subjects, the former are younger (41.4 vs. 53.1 years, p<0.0001), thinner (BMI 28.7 vs. 32.5 kg/sqm, p<0.0001) and with significantly smaller differences of the waist compared to the IDF cut-offs (11 vs. 20.2cm, p<0.0001). Conclusions: Waist circumference is an important clinical parameter which correlates with all the elements of the metabolic syndrome. Increased waist circumference should elicit metabolical evaluation and lifestyle modifications.","[Raluca, Pop] Univ Med & Pharm Tirgu Mures, Med Res Methodol Dept, Targu Mures, Romania; [Raluca, Pop] Univ Dunarea De Jos, Endocrinol Outpatient Clin, Emergency Mures Cty Hosp, Fac Med,Clin Med Dept 3, Galati, Romania; [Aurelia, Romila] Univ Med & Pharm Tirgu Mures, Clin Geriatr Dept, Galati Cty Hosp Emergency, Targu Mures, Romania; [Marian, Pop] Univ Med & Pharm Tirgu Mures, Targu Mures, Romania; [Bacarea, Anca] Univ Med & Pharm Tirgu Mures, Dept Pathophysiol, Targu Mures, Romania","Aurelia, R (corresponding author), Univ Dunarea De Jos, Dept Clin Med, Fac Med, Galati 1,Vadu Sacalelor St,Bl Pescarus,Ap 8, Galati, Romania.",,"Pop, Raluca/AAS-7928-2020; Pop, Marian/S-5302-2019; Bacarea, Anca/AAW-9459-2020","Pop, Marian/0000-0001-5324-9780; Pop, Raluca/0000-0003-1243-1855; Pop, Raluca-Monica/0000-0003-1775-4469",University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Tirgu Mures [5/23.12.2014],This project was supported in part by University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Tirgu Mures through Internal Research Grant 5/23.12.2014,,23,0,0,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1821.0,1825,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_169,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300013,,,,,2022-07-14

To describe the characteristics of patients admitted to the Division of General Internal Medicine (DGIM) at a tertiary hospital in relation to age and sex. Material and methods: All hospital admission episodes of DGIM via the registry of the Basic Minimum Data Set at the Hospital General Universitario de Alicante (Spain) from January 2000 to December 2012 were analyzed. We examine the relationship between the main diagnosis, length of stay, and destination at discharge, we stratified the analyses by age (under 80, 80-90, over 90) and by sex (males and female). Results: 18,570 (4.8%) out of 387, 862 hospital discharges >14 years old had been admitted to the DGIM. The number of admissions to the DGIM increased from 1,362 in 2000 to 1,671 in 2012 (R2=0.632). The median age of admissions was 76.9 in 2000 and 813 in 2012 (p<0.001). Female median age was 80.5 years old, which was older than males (76.9; p<0.001). After adjusting for sex, octogenarians and nonagenarians had a greater risk of being admitted for respiratory system diseases, genitourinary system diseases, circulatory system diseases and infectious and parasitic diseases. After adjusting for age, females had a greater risk of being admitted for disorders of the blood-forming organs, endocrine disorders, and circulatory system diseases. With respect to age, there was a higher increase in mortality in 80-89 year old patients (13.1%), and especially in illnesses of patients >90 years old (22.0%; p<0.001). Conclusion: The profile for octogenarians and nonagenarians admitted to the DGIM and hospital mortality is different to that of younger people.

Results: In general, during the years of 2012-2013, the air quality index was in a good and medium level (AQI<100) in 96% of cases, while in 4% of cases, it was beyond the standard limit. The PM10, SO2, O-3, and NO2 pollutants had the greatest and slightest rules in the air pollution of Dogonbadan City. August was the worst month in terms of PM10 pollution, since in this month 30% of pollution status had lied within the range of hazardous and above, whereas for other pollutants in this month, new unhealthy status was observed. Conclusions: Suspended particles were recognized as the major factor of air pollution in Dogonbadan City. Considering high levels of this pollutant, through timely notification, it is possible to prevent further complications for people with heart or lung diseases.","[Rezaei, Soheila; Bagheri, Amin; Mirzaei, Nezam] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Velayati, Azad] Kurdistan Univ Med Sci, Environm Hlth Res Ctr, Sanandaj, Iran; [Moradzadeh, Rahmatollah] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Tehran, Iran; [Sohrabi, Younes] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Engn, Kermanshah, Iran; [Jamshidi, Arsalan] Yasuj Univ Med Sci, Social Determinants Hlth Res Ctr, Yasuj, Iran; [Zare, Morteza; Ansari, Ghasem] Yasuj Univ Med Sci, Yasuj, Iran; [Ahmadpour, Mohammad] Maragheh Univ Med Sci, Dept Publ Hlth, Maragheh, Iran; [Mirzaei, Nezam] Kurdistan Univ Med Sci, Environm Hlth Res Ctr, Sanandaj, Iran","Mirzaei, N (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Engn, Environm Hlth Engn, Tehran, Iran.",nezammirzaei@yahoo.com,"Ahmadpour, Mohammad/AAB-9914-2021; sohrabi, younes/AAA-1572-2022; mirzaei, nezam/G-3232-2017","Moradzadeh, Rahmatollah/0000-0003-4952-3454; mirzaei, nezam/0000-0003-4779-1519",,,,26,2,2,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,4.0,,1449.0,1455,,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YQ,WOS:000392283200024,,,,,2022-07-14

In severe cases, the magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is one of essential drugs. Administration of MgSO4 can prevent eclampsia and causes a reduction in fetal distress. The effect of MgSO4 on fetal circulation is a good explanation for this reduction in fetal distress. Color-Doppler ultrasound is an appropriate devicein order to evaluate circulation evaluation. Objective: This study was performed to evaluate the effect of magnesium sulfate on Doppler flow velocity parameters in the uterine arteries and fetal outcome. Methods: This prospective studyincluded 21 pregnant women with severe preeclampsia who were referred to Imam-Reza Hospital of Kermanshah. Before and afteradministration of MgSO4, Doppler ultrasound was performed to evaluate the uterine arteries blood flow. Newborns were under close observation after delivery. Data entry and statistical analysis were performed. Results: Significant difference was detected between resistant index (RI) of uterine artery before and after injection of magnesium sulfate (p<0.001). There was no significant correlation between maternal serum hemoglobin levels before delivery with gestational age and variation in RI (p=0.9 and 0.5, respectively). Conclusion: Administration of Magnesium sulfate changes Doppler flow velocimetry parameters andcauses the fetal perfusion improvement that can lead to reduction of fetal distress.

Nevertheless, cancer diagnosis is still a hard existential text that destabilizes everyday life, all the psychic and relational balance, inevitably causing a psychological and social change not only in the patient who is affected but also into the wide social network around him (family, friends, doctors, healthcare team.). The aim of this review is to understand how problems, feelings, emotions, distresses or defense mechanisms could garble the relation and the communication dynamics between physician and patients and then prejudicing the efficacy of oncologic therapeutic compliance. Pubmed and Scopus were searched, using strings related to cancer, physician-patient relations, burn-out, compliance, and communication, identifying literature published from 2000 to January 2015. Extracted papers were assessed for their relevance (10 of 412 papers initially reviewed).

When untreated, SRBD and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) mainly, may impact school performance, cognition, metabolism, and cardiovascular function. Aim of the present study is assessing the visuomotor integration skills in children affected by OSA. Materials and methods: 57 subjects affected by mild-to severe OSA, PSG diagnosed according to international diagnostic criteria, (31 males and 26 females) (mean age 10.8; SD +/- 2.49) and 83 healthy children (45 males and 38 females) (mean age 9.95; SD +/- 1.87; p = 0.725). All subjects underwent assessment of motor coordination skills with Movement-ABC tests and visual-motor integration ability with Visual Motor Integration (VMI) test. Results: The subjects with OSA show a worse average performances in all items of Movement ABC (p < 0.001) respect of controls. Specifically, children with OSAS show significantly higher values of total points (p < 0.001), manual dexterity (p < 0.001), ball skills (p < 0.001) and balance (p < 0.001). Accordingly, the average centile in OSA children at the MABC-test is significantly reduced compared with controls (p < 0.001). (Table 1) On the other hand, the VMI test evaluation among children with OSAS shows worst result in total Visuo-Motor Integration (p < 0.001), and in Motor Coordination sub-item (p < 0.001) than controls. (Table 1). Conclusion: Our results also support for children and adolescents the hypothesis that executive functioning deficits might be linked primarily to the degree of severity nocturnal hypoxemia rather than daytime sleepiness, although several other studies are needed.","[Ruberto, Maria] Univ Naples 2, Dept Mental Hlth & Phys Med & Prevented, Headache Ctr Children & Adolescents, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Naples, Italy; [Precenzano, Francesco] Univ Naples 2, Dept Med Surg & Dent Specialties, Naples, Italy; [Parisi, Lucia; Maltese, Agata; Roccella, Michele] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Messina, Giovanni] Univ Foggia, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Foggia, Italy; [Messina, Giovanni] Univ Naples 2, Dept Expt Med, Naples, Italy","Roccella, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",,"Messina, Giovanni/AAE-8668-2022","Messina, Giovanni/0000-0002-0011-867X; Precenzano, Francesco/0000-0002-3812-1786",,,,39,20,20,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_146,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000017,,,,,2022-07-14

Methods: 86 consecutive patients who were candidate to undergo uterine artery embolization for management of uterine leiomyoma were included. Before and 6 months after embolization, the volume of leiomyoma and RI of the uterine artery were measured and compared using gray-scale and color Doppler ultrasonography methods. Results: Mean (+/- SD) leiomyoma volume decreased from 116.09 (+/- 75.86) cm(3) to 64.76 (+/- 39.52) cm(3) 6 months after embolization (P< 0.001).

We aimed to compare the right ventricular (RV) diastolic function in pulmonary artery hypertensive patients and healthy individuals using the echocardiography findings. Methods: In this study, 32 individuals with pulmonary artery pressure of >= 40 were selected as a case group and 32 healthy individuals were selected as the control group, and the echocardiography indices of RV diastolic function were compared between the two groups. Results: Nineteen individuals in the case group had RV diastolic dysfunction (59.4%), while none were observed in the control group (p<0.001). The mean (+/- SD) of E/E' ratio was significantly higher in the case group compared to the control group, which confirms the RV dysfunction (P=0.002). Although the tricuspid peak A velocity in the case group was significantly higher compared to the control group, its rate was within the normal range in both groups (P=0.01). In addition, the mean (+/- SD) of the E/A ratio and E'/A' ratio were significantly lower in the case group than in the control group, which showed the RV dysfunction (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the other RV diastolic indices between the two groups (p>0.05). Conclusions: The presence of pulmonary hypertension can affect the RV diastolic indices, and this is explained in our study by the decreased E/A ratio. Therefore, considering the role of RV diastolic function in the prevention of heart failure and its complications, understanding the current status of these indices is highly important.","[Salehi, Nahid; Saidi, Mohammadreza; Rai, Alireza; Moheghi, Simin] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Kermanshah, Iran; [Tadbiri, Hooman] Iran Univ Med Sci, Tehran, Iran","Tadbiri, H (corresponding author), Iran Univ Med Sci, Tehran, Iran.",H_tadbiri@student.tums.ac.ir,"Rai, Alireza/B-9749-2018; Salehi, Nahid/S-5521-2017","Rai, Alireza/0000-0001-5766-4578",,,,24,2,2,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,2.0,,927.0,931,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SU,WOS:000390175400012,,,,,2022-07-14

In this retrospective study, medical records of 1,498 patients who underwent coronary angiography were reviewed. The data extracted were entered into a checklist. NLR was calculated using complete blood count (CBC) reports and the number of diseased coronary arteries was determined using coronary angiography reports. The data were analyzed using SPSS software (ver. 20.0) by analysis of variance (ANOVA), t test, Kruskal-Wallis, and Pearson correlation tests. There were significant (P<0.05) relationships between NLR, history of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), fasting blood sugar, serum creatinine and urea, white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin, platelet count, MCV (mean corpuscular volume), and with the number of diseased coronary arteries detected on coronary angiography.

Objectives: We aimed to compare diastolic functional status after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with the baseline in patients with known coronary artery disease. Methods: Sixty consecutive patients with known coronary artery disease according to coronary angiography findings who were candidates for elective CABG were enrolled in a before-after interventional study. Before and also three months after CABG, the parameters of left ventricular diastolic function were measured by Doppler and tissue Doppler echocardiography by the Paired t test with considering p-value of less than 0.05 as significant. Results: The mean +/- SD age of the participants was59.6 +/- 8.7 years (range: 46-78 years) and 75% were men. With regard to the changes in echocardiography parameters, significant improvement in mean DT index (from 224 +/- 54 msec to 192 +/- 42 msec, p < 0.001), IVRT (from 104 +/- 22 msec to 85 +/- 13 msec, p < 0.001), E/Ea Ratio (from 11.19 +/- 3.74 to 9.30 +/- 2.67, P< 0.001), and LV ejection fraction (from 47.59 +/- 6.94% to 49.36 +/- 7.77%, P=0.007) was observed. Among all subjects, 56.6% experienced improvement in cardiac diastolic function index with more improvement in men than in women, non-diabetics compared with diabetics, normotensive compared with hypertensive individuals (57.1% versus 36.6%), and nonsmokers than in smokers. Younger patients also experienced more improvement in diastolic function index than the patients older than 60 years, however the improvement of these functional parameters remained independent to the number of involved coronary vessels.

There is still uncertain the best echocardiography parameters for predicting clinical outcome in patients with heart failure. The present study assessed the value of right ventricular systolic and diastolic parameters to predict long-term outcome and also health-related quality of life (QOL) in patients with heart failure. Methods: One hundred and forty patients diagnosed as congestive heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35% were included into the study. Systolic and diastolic functional status was assessed using tissue Doppler echocardiography and QOL was also assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire. The patients were followed-up by telephone to determine one-year survival and rate of re-hospitalization. Results: The tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and right ventricular tissue Doppler imaging systolic velocity (STDI) were positively and E/Ea ratio were adversely associated with higher QOL score. Using the multivariate linear regression model, among baseline variables and echocardiography parameters, the level of QOL could predicted by higher STDI (beta = 0.811, standard error = 0.369, p = 0.030) and lower E/Ea ratio (beta = -0.626, standard error = 0.242, p = 0.011). Also, using the ROC curve analysis, the systolic parameters of TAPSE and STDI, as well as E/Ea diastolic function index could predict patients' QOL level. One-year survival rate was estimated 99.3% and also one-year readmission-free survival rate was also 70.0%. Using the Cox proportional hazard modeling, none of the baseline demographic, clinical, and echocardiography parameters could predict long-term readmission in heart failure patients. Conclusion: QOL level in heart failure patients can be predicted by right ventricular systolic parameters of TAPSE and STDI as well as E/Ea diastolic parameter assessed by tissue Doppler imaging. However, both right ventricular systolic and diastolic parameters may not be helpful to predict the rate of readmission in patients with heart failure.","[Salehi, Nahid; Saidi, Mohammad-Reza; Rai, Alireza; Hosseyni, Hosna; Janjani, Parisa] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Dept Cardiol, Kermanshah, Iran; [Janjani, Parisa] Razi Univ, Fac Social Sci, Psychol, Kermanshah, Iran; [Tadbiri, Hooman] IranUniv MedSci, Tehran, Iran","Tadbiri, H (corresponding author), IranUniv MedSci, Tehran, Iran.",H_tadbiri@student.tums.ac.ir,"Janjani, Parisa/AAY-1921-2020; Salehi, Nahid/S-5521-2017; Rai, Alireza/B-9749-2018","Salehi, Nahid/0000-0002-4757-6336; Janjani, Parisa/0000-0002-7394-8447; Rai, Alireza/0000-0001-5766-4578",,,,6,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,5.0,,1985.0,1989,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YW,WOS:000392283800013,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 252 patients meeting the medical history and physical examination criteria for TIA (n=99) and IS (n=153) Neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts, platelet distribution width (PDW), and mean platelet volume (MPV) levels obtained from the complete blood count taken at the time of emergency department admission were recorded for both patient and control groups; platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were calculated from these parameters. The ischemic stroke, TIA, and control groups, as well as other subgroups were compared with one another with respect to the complete blood count parameters. Results: Neutrophil count, MPV, and NLR levels were higher in the IS group compared to the control group whereas IS group had a lower lymphocyte count, platelet count, and a PDW level compared to the control group. TIA group had a higher neutrophil count, NLR and PLR than the control group whereas lymphocyte count and PDW level were lower in the TIA group compared to the control group. MPV level was higher in the IS and infarct-positive TIA patient group than both the control group and infarct-negative TIA patient group. Conclusion: Owing to high MPV levels in both infarct-positive TIA and IS, we suggest that MPV can be a good marker for infarction. Furthermore, lower platelet count in the IS group and higher PLR in the TIA group can both be used in the differential diagnosis of both conditions.","[San, Ishak] Golbasi Hasvak State Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Ankara, Turkey; [Icme, Ferhat; Yuzbasioglu, Yucel; Otal, Yavuz; Coskun, Selcuk; Sener, Alp] Ataturk Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Ankara, Turkey; [Erol, Erkut] Elazig Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Elazig, Turkey; [Kahraman, Ahmet Fatih] Bozok Univ, Fak Med, Dept Emergency Med, Zonguldak, Turkey","Icme, F (corresponding author), Ankara Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Clin Emergency Med, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.;Icme, F (corresponding author), Ataturk Egitim & Arasurma Hastanesi, Acil Serv, Eskisehir Yolu 2 Km, Ankara, Turkey.",,"Şan, İshak/AAG-2175-2019; Otal, Yavuz/AAA-1140-2022; DOGAN, NURETTIN OZGUR/G-1461-2018; İÇME, Doç.

The treatment options are very limited in infections caused by multi drug resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa strains. Combinations of antimicrobials are frequently used in the treatment of MDR P. aeruginosa infections. In this study we investigated the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem(IMP), doripenem(DOR), colistin(CO) and polymyxin B (PO) alone and in vitro synergistic activity of carbapenem-polymixin combinations (IMP-CO, DOR-CO and DOR-PO) in MDR P. aeruginosa strains obtained from patients in ICUs. Materials and methods: Thirty P. aeruginosa strains isolated from various clinical specimens of patients in ICUs were included in the study. The epsilometer test(E test), which is a gradient diffusion method was used for determining synergistic activities of different antibiotic combinations. Synergistic, additive, indifferent and antagonist effects of P. aeruginosa strains were evaluated by fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index. Results: Of the 30 MDR P. aeruginosa strains tested, susceptibility rates for IMP, DOR and PO were 40%, 70% and 96.6%, respectively. Resistance to CO was not detected. IMP-CO, DOR-CO and DOR-PO combinations were found to have synergistic or additive effect in 19.9%, 3.3% and 3.3% of the tested strains, respectively. Conclusion: Combination therapy is recommended for the treatment of MDR P. aeruginosa infections in order to ensure synergistic action and decrease the risk of development of resistance. In this study, combinations of IMP-CO, DOR-CO and DOR-PO exhibited synergistic activity in some MDR P. aeruginosa strains. Among the tested antimicrobial combinations, IMP-CO combination was the most effective against MDR P. aeruginosa strains. The development of new combination therapy protocols will help clinicians in selecting appropriate agents for the treatments of infections caused by MDR bacteria.","[Sanal, Laser] Yuksek Ihtisas Training & Res Hosp, Microbiol Lab, TR-06420 Ankara, Turkey; [Sen, Suha] Yuksek Ihtisas Training & Res Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, Ankara, Turkey; [Cesur, Salih] Ankara Numune Training & Res Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, Ankara, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Neziha] Bozok Univ, Dept Microbiol, Yozgat, Turkey","Sanal, L (corresponding author), Yuksek Ihtisas Training & Res Hosp, Microbiol Lab, TR-06420 Ankara, Turkey.",,"yılmaz, neziha/AAH-3524-2020",,"Yuksek Ihtisas Training and Research Hospital, Project Ihtisas Training and Research Hospital [322-1]","This study was presented as a poster presentation in the 7th Eurasia Congress of Infectious Diseases between 30 September and 3 October 2015 in Tbilisi, Georgia and 30th National Congress of Antibiotic and Chemotherapy at 6-10 May 2015 in TRNC (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus) and was supported by a grant from Yuksek Ihtisas Training and Research Hospital, Project Ihtisas Training and Research Hospital, Project no: 322-1.",,27,1,1,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,4.0,,,,,1041.0,1046,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_129,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DY1XF,WOS:000384887000029,,,,,2022-07-14

A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of first line treatment adjusted to the main classification models. Materials and methods: The primary end points were: median overall survival (mOS) and median progression-free survival (mPFS) times. The evaluation of cost-effectiveness throughout treatment was assessed by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) based on the cost per year of life gained (YLG). Results: The study included 88 patients, grouped according to the drug used for first-line treatment. An increase of 4.9 (p = 0.000) in mPFS and 12.6 months (p = 0.000) for mOS was found among patients treated with sunitinib compared with those treated with temsirolimus. By adjusting the mPFS treatments according to the main classification models, we observe that a statistically significant difference remains between the treatments in both the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and Hudes model. This was not found in the Heng model, in which there is a slight statistically insignificant difference in favor of temsirolimus. No differences were found in the mOS in any case. In the poor prognosis group, which is the prognostic criteria required for the use of temsirolimus, the incremental cost of sunitinib per month free of progression would be of 3,098.2(sic). Conclusions: Based on these results it appears that the use of temsirolimus as the most effective option for patients with a poor prognosis, as defined by the criteria in the pivotal trial of temsirolimus or the MSKCC model, may be questionable. However, a larger population would be needed in both groups to determine the relevance of these results.","[Sastre-Heres, Alejandro J.; Ruiz-Sanchez, Daniel] Hosp Univ Cent Asturias, Dept Hosp Pharm, Pharm Resident Hosp, C Julian Claveria S-N, Oviedo 33006, Asturias, Spain; [Sastre-Heres, Alejandro J.; Iglesias Peinado, Irene] Univ Complutense Madrid, Faculy Pharm, Ciudad Univ,Pl Ramon y Cajal, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Garcia Diaz, Benito] Hosp Univ Severo Ochoa, Dept Hosp Pharm, C Ave Orellana S-N, Madrid 28911, Spain; [Pena-Diaz, Jaime] Univ Granada, Fac Pharm, SEFH Spanish Soc Hosp Pharm, Campus Univ Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain","Sastre-Heres, AJ (corresponding author), Hosp Univ Cent Asturias, Serv Farm, C Julian Claveria S-N, Oviedo 33006, Spain.",,"IGLESIAS PEINADO, IRENE/H-3814-2015","IGLESIAS PEINADO, IRENE/0000-0002-6903-014X",,,,21,1,1,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_151,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000022,,,,,2022-07-14

The purpose of this study is to investigate the levels of Cys-C and total free thiol (TFT) in the serum and synovial liquid of patients with OA. Materials and methods: Forty OA patients, diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, and 40 healthy individuals were included in the study. In serum and fluid samples taken from patients and controls, the serum TFT levels were studied with Elman's method, and the Cys-C levels were studied with colorimetric method using commercially available kits in an autoanalyzer. Results: Cys-C levels were significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group (p<0.05), and serum TFT levels were similar between groups (p>0.05). A correlation analysis showed that the levels of serum Cys-C were positively correlated with the presence of OA (correlation coefficient = 0.300, p = 0.014) and negatively correlated with the TFT levels (correlation coefficient = -0.231, p = 0.024). In the regression analysis, it was observed that only the presence of OA independently affected the levels of Cys-C beta regression coefficient = 0.130, p = 0.024). Conclusion: In patients with OA, the level of serum Cys-C was determined to be higher than in controls. This may be related with the pathogenesis of disease, increased oxidative stress, or chronic inflammation in OA.","[Savik, Emin; Sezen, Hatice; Aksoy, Nurten] Harran Univ, Fac Med, Dept Clin Biochem, TR-63300 Sanliurfa, Turkey; [Altay, Nuray] Harran Univ, Fac Med, Dept Anesthesiol & Reanimat, TR-63300 Sanliurfa, Turkey; [Altay, Mehmet Akif; Erturk, Cemil] Harran Univ, Fac Med, Dept Orthoped Surg, TR-63300 Sanliurfa, Turkey","Sezen, H (corresponding author), Harran Univ, Fac Med, Dept Clin Biochem, Resource & Educ Hosp, Meteorol St, TR-63300 Sanliurfa, Turkey.",,"ALTAY, Mehmet Akif/AAG-2803-2021; Ertürk, Cemil/AAI-7366-2020",,,,,32,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,767.0,772,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_87,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400016,,,,,2022-07-14

Antibiotherapy must be started as early as possible since it seems to be the most important factor determining survival. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the time intervals between diagnosis and first dose of antibiotherapy and its impact on mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock patients. Materials and methods: Medical records of adult patients (>= 18 years old) admitted to medical ICU of a 1200-bed university hospital in Izmir,Turkey with the diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic shock between January 1,2010 and June 30,2014 were evaluated retrospectively. The patients admitted with other diagnosis than severe sepsis and septic shock and patients having an advanced stage of malignancy were excluded. Results: One hundred and ten patients were identified fullfilling the inclusion criteria. 49(44.5%) patients were female and 61(55.5%) were male. Average age of the patients was 74,3 +/- 11,6. Average time from diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock to first dose of antibiotherapy was identified to be 6,9 4,7 hours. Patients were classified into two groups according to application of first dose of antibiotherapy (early<3 hours vs late>3 hours). The overall mortality rate was 54.5%. Mortality rates in early group were significantly lower than late group [25%(n=5) vs 61%(n=55), p<0,05 J. Chronic renal failure was the only comorbidity significantly affecting mortality (p<0,05). Logistic regression analysis displayed early antibiotherapy (p=0,005), culture positivity (p=0,025) and APACHE II scores (p=0,006) to be important in predicting mortality. Conclusions: Time to antibiotherapy is an extremely important factor predicting mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock. Any delay in diagnosis and intense treatment including appropriate antibiotherapy should be avoided to decrease mortality rates.","[Savran, Yusuf; Duran, Yakup] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Izmir, Turkey; [Comert, Bilgin] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Intens Care Unit, Izmir, Turkey","Savran, Y (corresponding author), Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Mithatpasa Cad 1606 Inciralti Yerleskesi, TR-35340 Izmir, Turkey.",,"Savran, Yusuf/AAI-1796-2019; Cömert, Bilgin/P-3030-2019","Cömert, Bilgin/0000-0002-2148-5356; SAVRAN, YUSUF/0000-0002-0130-4730",,,,24,3,3,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,17.0,22,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700002,,,,,2022-07-14

While 80% of the arrests occur due to cardiac pathologies, 20% occur due to non-cardiac pathologies. Determining the underlying pathology is very important. In this retrospective study, we examined the potential utilities of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in cardiac and non-cardiac arrest distinction. Materials and methods: We enrolled the following participants: 136 patients with cardiac arrests and 152 patients with noncardiac arrests between January 2012 and December 2015. The distinction was made primarily on whether cardiac pathology was present. The cardiac pathology was determined by using cardiac enzyme levels, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings, angiographic results, and patient history. Results: Cardiac arrests were observed more frequently in male patients, while the number of non-cardiac arrests was greater in female patients (p= 0.018). PLR and NLR were higher in non-cardiac arrests than in cardiac arrests (p< 0.001 for PLR and p= 0.001 for NLR). None of these parameters showed any effect on the 30-day mortality. The sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV) of the PLRs and NLRs were 80.1%, 42.2%, 64.0%, and 62.3% and 49.7%, 73.5%, 68.8%, and 55.4%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for the PLR was 61.7%, and the AUC for the NLR was 61.0%. Conclusion: We suggest that the NLR and PLR can be helpful in the differential diagnosis of cardiac and non-cardiac arrest. Thus, the NLR and PLR should be evaluated in addition to the clinical examination.","[Sen Tanrikulu, Ceren; Akilli, Nazire Belgin; Guunaydini, Yahya Kemal] Konya Training & Educ Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Konya, Turkey; [Koylu, Oznur] Konya Training & Educ Hosp, Dept Biochem, Konya, Turkey","Sen Tanrikulu, C (corresponding author), Sagik Bilimleri Univ, Konya Egitim & Arastirma Hastanesi, Saglik Bakanligi, Acil Tip Anabilim Dali, TR-42100 Meram Konya, Turkey.",,"Akilli, Nazire/AAD-9457-2020","Akilli, Nazire/0000-0001-9329-0964",,,,39,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_140,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000011,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: This prospective study was performed on a total of 270 participants between January 2013 and June 2014. The participants were divided into two groups: Group 1 (PAD group) included 180 patients with PAD (mean age: 55 +/- 18 years, 128 males), and Group 2 (control group) included 90 participants (mean age: 53 +/- 15 years, 61 males) with normal physical examination and arterial duplex ultrasonography findings for PAD. Groups were compared with each other according to the clinical and demographic characteristics, levels of some biochemical parameters, allele frequencies, and particularly Adducin Gly460Trp, MTHFR C677T and A1298C gene polymorphisms, which were determined by using real time polymerase chain reaction. Results: The incidences of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, family history of cardiovascular diseases and fasting glucose levels were significantly higher in PAD group. Both groups were statistically similar according to the levels of total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, urea and creatinine. Comparison of both groups according to the Adducin Gly460Trp, MTHFR C677T and A1298C gene polymorphisms, and allele frequencies did not yield any statistically significant differences. Conclusion: We concluded that Adducin Gly460Trp, MTHFR C677T and A1298C gene polymorphisms were not predictive factors for PAD.

High resistance against Beta-lactamase in staphylococcus strains has led to concerns in medical system. Therefore, a rapid and effective method should be used to diagnose resistance. This study aimed to determine the antibiotic resistance pattern, the abundance of mecAgene, and the class and types of SCCmec in staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from the clinical samples of Isfahan. Materials an methods: In a cross-sectional study, 252 clinical samples with the age range from infancy to 90 years old were selected from Asgarieh hospital and Nobel laboratory. After determining the identification of isolations, the antibiotic sensitivity to disk diffusion method was evaluated. Resistance to methicillin was evaluated based on agar screening method. Also, MIC values were examined using Etest method. The identification of mecA and determination of SCCmec types were done by MultiplexPCR method. Results: Among 120 isolations of staphylococcus epidermidis, according to agar screening test and Etest, 68 isolations were resistant to methicillin. The prevalence of resistance to methicillin was observed in 37 samples (54/41%). The typing of SCCmec types were different: 17 (45/94%) isolations were Type V, 5 (13/51%) isolations were Type II, 3 (8/1%) isolations were type III, 2 (5/4%) isolations were Type IV, 2 (5/4%) isolations were Type I, 1 (2/7%) isolation was Type IV, and 12 (32/43%) isolations were non-typable. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the most abundant type of SCCmec wasType V (67/5%) that transfers many resistance genes.","[Shamansouri, Shabnam] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Biol Microbiol Researcher, Falavarjan Branch, Esfahan, Iran; [Karbasizade, Vajehe] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Biol, Falavarjan Branch, Med Microbiol, Esfahan, Iran; [Khozaie, Mehdi] Isfahan Univ, Coll Biol, Dept Biol, Plant Biotechnol, Esfahan, Iran","Shamansouri, S (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Biol Microbiol Researcher, Falavarjan Branch, Esfahan, Iran.",,"Karbasizade, Vajihe/AAA-3417-2020","Karbasizade, Vajihe/0000-0002-3765-8151",,,,45,2,2,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,5.0,,2107.0,2113,,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YW,WOS:000392283800036,,,,,2022-07-14

This study was conducted to assess serum level of soluble Transferin Receptor (sTfR) in children with IDA and healthy subjects recruited to Children's Medical Center. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 26 children with IDA and 27 apparently healthy were recruited from Children's Medical Center, Tehran, Iran, from 2008 to 2009. Hb, MCV were measured using a SYSMEX K21 cell counter. The serum ferritin(SF) was measured using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on an automated Elecsys2010 (Roche Diagnostics) and serum sTfR levels were measured by ELISA method. Results: In Children with IDA had higher level of sTfR, compared with control group. We found a significant negative correlation of sTfR with Hb, MCV and ferritin although it was not significant for SF. STfR found to be unrelated to age and gender in both groups. Conclusion: When a ferritin level is not reliable in circumstances such as infection and inflammation, sTfR can be considered as a useful test for evaluating iron deficiency.","[Shams, Sedigheh; Mohammadian, Seydeh Omolbanin; Monajemzadeh, Maryam; Emamgholipour, Solaleh; Ashtiani, Mohammad Taghi Haghi; Irani, Heshmat; Shafeghat, Leila] Childrens Med Ctr, Pediat Ctr Excellence, Tehran, Iran; [Shams, Sedigheh; Monajemzadeh, Maryam; Ashtiani, Mohammad Taghi Haghi] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Dept Pathol, Tehran, Iran; [Shams, Sedigheh] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Res Ctr Urol, Tehran, Iran","Shams, S (corresponding author), Childrens Med Ctr, Pediat Ctr Excellence, Dept Pathol, Dr Qarib St,Keshavarz Blvd, Tehran 1419733151, Iran.",shamss@sina.tums.ac.ir,"Emamgholipour, Solaleh/T-6035-2017","Emamgholipour, Solaleh/0000-0002-9949-5773",Tehran University of Medical Sciences & health Services grant,This research has been supported by Tehran University of Medical Sciences & health Services grant.

Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a common side effect of cancer therapy that can have an impact on quality of life and survivorship. PN may happen in MM due to adverse effect of chemotherapeutics, amyloidosis or as a part of paraneoplastic syndrome. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in multiple myeloma patients and its association with age and disease outcome. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 92 multiple myeloma patients who presented to hematology clinic between 2009 and 2014. Their age, gender, performance status, chemotherapeutic regimens, stage of disease, diabetes status and electromyography results were noted. An association between clinical parameters and neuropathy was analyzed. Kaplan Meier analysis was used in statistical comparisons between mortality and other parameters. Results: The mean age of patients was 64 +/- 11.6. Patients with neuropathy were enrolled as group 1 (27.2%) and patients without neuropathy were enrolled as group 2 (72.8%). No significant association was found between age and peripheral neuropathy (p=1.00). The estimated median survival time was 27 months in patients with PN, whereas 56 months in patients without PN (p=0.273). In group 1 three year overall survival rate was 41% whereas in group 2 it was 57%. Conclusion: It is important to understand pathophysiology of PN and recognize who is at risk since; it is a common side effect of MM treatment. This study is among the few analyses evaluating prevalence of peripheral neuropathy confirmed with electromyography in MM patients. There was no significant association between increased age, survival and neuropathy. Evaluating other associations and understanding potential risks with further research may guide us in developing better preventive and treatment modalities for PN in older MM patients.","[Silay, Kamile] Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Fac Med, Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Internal Med & Geriatr, Ankara, Turkey; [Akinci, Sema; Guney, Tekin] Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Hematol, Ankara, Turkey; [Ulas, Arife] Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Ankara, Turkey; [Yalcin, Ahmet] Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Geriatr, Ankara, Turkey; [Dilek, Imdat] Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Fac Med, Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Hematol, Ankara, Turkey","Silay, K (corresponding author), Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Fac Med, Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Internal Med & Geriatr, Ankara, Turkey.",,"Yalcin, Ahmet/AAA-9697-2020","Yalcin, Ahmet/0000-0001-9472-2212",,,,24,1,1,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,123.0,126,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700019,,,,,2022-07-14

However, previous studies on its clinical association in pleural tuberculosis are lacking. The aim of study is to investigate the association between serum PCT and clinical parameters and define its utility, in patients with pleural tuberculosis. Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 71 immuocompetence patients (median age, 44 years; PCT < 0.05 ng/mL, n = 40 vs. PCT >= 0.05 ng/mL, n = 31), with pleural tuberculosis Results: There were 44 males. The median serum PCT level was 0.025ng/mL (interquartile range (IQR): 0.025 - 0.110). Forty patients (56%) had pulmonary tuberculosis by radiologic or microbiological criteria. One patient died, and two patients had drug resistance. At the end of treatment, the incidence of residual pleural opacity (RPO) was 62% on chest radiography (CXR). Male, pleuro-pulmonary tuberculosis, high pleural lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), RPO on CXR and mycobacterial identification in pleural fluid were associated with abnormal serum PCT level, in univariable logistic analysis. However, only pleuro-pulmonary tuberculosis (OR: 5.099, 95% CI, 1.044 - 24.908, P = 0.044) and high pleural LDH (OR: 12.874, 95% CI, 2.885 - 57.453, P = 0.001) were still significantly related to serum PCT above normal value, by multivariable logistic analysis. Conclusions: Serum PCT level can be associated with concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis and the degree of pleural inflammation in pleural tuberculosis. Therefore, serum PCT can aid physicians in selecting patients that require early isolation and greater attention.","[Song, Jae-Uk; Lim, Seong Yong; Lim, Si Young] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Med, Kangbuk Samsung Hosp, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med,Dept Internal Med, 108 Pyeong Dong, Seoul, South Korea; [Kwag, Hyon Joo; Hong, Hyun Pyo] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Med, Kangbuk Samsung Hosp, Dept Radiol, 108 Pyeong Dong, Seoul, South Korea; [Yeom, Joon-Sup] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Med, Kangbuk Samsung Hosp, Div Infect Dis,Dept Internal Med, 108 Pyeong Dong, Seoul, South Korea; [Kwon, Min-Jung] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Med, Kangbuk Samsung Hosp, Dept Lab Med & Genet, 108 Pyeong Dong, Seoul, South Korea","Song, JU (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Med, Kangbuk Samsung Hosp, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med,Dept Internal Med, 108 Pyeong Dong, Seoul, South Korea.",,"Yeom, Joon Sup/Q-5559-2019","Yeom, Joon Sup/0000-0001-8940-7170",,,,26,1,1,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,447.0,455,,,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000029,,,,,2022-07-14

Accurate identification and classification of atherosclerotic plaques are essential for predict the possible evolution of plaques. Materials and methods: Automated tissue characterization including atherosclerotic plaques, vessel branching and stent struts in IVUS gray-scale images is addressed. The texture features are firstly detected with local binary pattern (LBP), Haar-like and Gabor filter. Then, a Gentle Adaboost classifier is designed to classify tissue texture features. The manual characterization results obtained by experienced physicians were adopted as the golden standard to evaluate the accuracy. Results: Results with clinically acquired image data indicate that the recognition accuracy of lipidic plaques can reach 94.54%, while classification precision of fibrous and calcified plaques can reach 93.08%. The recognition accuracy of branching and stents can reach 93.20% and 93.50%, respectively. Conclusion: Fully automated identification of soft/hard plaques, vessel branching and stent struts can be realized through detecting and classifying the texture features of IVUS images. However, accurate classification of lipidic, fibrous, calcified and mixed plaques may be implemented according to grey-scale images combined with raw radio-frequency signals.","[Sun Zheng; Wang Lixin; Zhou Ya] North China Elect Power Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Baoding 071003, Peoples R China","Sun, Z (corresponding author), North China Elect Power Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Baoding 071003, Peoples R China.",sunzheng_tju@163.com,,,National Nature Science Foundations of China [61372042]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2014ZD31],This work was supported by National Nature Science Foundations of China (Grant no. 61372042) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant no. 2014ZD31).,,20,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,3.0,,1167.0,1172,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YM,WOS:000392282800009,,,,,2022-07-14

This study aimed to explain ethical predictability of healthcare centers in Iran. Methodology: This qualitative study was conducted on 25 people selected by purposive sampling. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews, which were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed several times, and examined by three experts. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis. Results: A total of 706 concepts were extracted, and categorized in three main themes of essential infrastructures, barriers to ethical predictability, and accountable organization Conclusion: The results showed that ethical predictability depends on certain underlying factors, including concurrent respect for the rights of clients and employees, motivational management, and institutionalization of ethics. Hence, managers can enhance predictability by considering ethical indicators as criteria for decision-making and policy-making. This will in turn lead to respect for the rights of patients and employees.

Because of steadily expanding ascend in death rate, the earnest need is to discover novel prognostic biomarkers. In this attempt, inflammation has been a prominent target because of its importance in the development and behavior of atherosclerotic plaques. The current article came up from the recent suggestions by the scientific community on the role of neutrophils to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as an inflammatory predictive biomarker of cardiovascular events at an early stage. Materials and methods: Blood samples were collected from 100 chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) patients who have visited the outpatient department (OPD) at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and 100 healthy control individuals. Complete blood examination was done on Cell-Dyn Ruby, USA to calculate NLR. In addition, lipid profile, platelet counts, red cell distribution width (RDW), C-reactive proteins (CRP), fasting glucose, insulin and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were also measured by various procedures on different instruments. Results: Total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) showed a significant rise of around 13%. However, non-highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (Non-HDL) level showed a similar decline (P< 0.05) compared with control. A remarkable rise in fasting glucose, Hb1Ac, and insulin by 58%, 53%, and 44% was recorded in CAD group. Moreover, CRP level also showed a significant rise of 39% in CAD group compared with control individuals. The white blood cell (WBC) analysis revealed a significant enhancement in total WBC, neutrophils and lymphocytes counts. The calculated NLR was found to be significantly (P< 0.001) elevated by 110% in CAD patients compared with control individuals. Conclusions: In view of significant enhancement of NLR level in our samples, we recommend its use as a predictive biomarker of CAD because it is a simple and inexpensive method and could be performed in a routine blood sample.","[Tabrez, Shams; Jabir, Nasimudeen R.; Firoz, Chelapram K.] King Abdulaziz Univ, King Fahd Med Res Ctr, POB 80216, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Nabilalama, Mohammed] King Abdulaziz Univ Hosp, Dept Med, Cardiol Unit, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia","Tabrez, S (corresponding author), King Abdulaziz Univ, King Fahd Med Res Ctr, POB 80216, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.",,"Tabrez, Shams/H-9476-2012; Rehumathbeevi, Jabir Nasimudeen/H-9483-2012; Tabrez, Shams/H-7315-2019; KANDY, FIROZ CHELAPRAM/H-9487-2012","Tabrez, Shams/0000-0003-4550-415X; Rehumathbeevi, Jabir Nasimudeen/0000-0001-8548-7986; Tabrez, Shams/0000-0003-4550-415X; KANDY, FIROZ CHELAPRAM/0000-0002-8832-9411","Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah [141 - 912 - D1435]; DSR","This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, under grant No. (141 - 912 - D1435).

Hypoxia and blood re-oxygenation episodes called intermittent hypoxia (IH) initiates the inflammatory response. Midkine (MK), is a heparin-binding protein and plays a key role in angiogenesis and inflammation. Expression of MK increases under hypoxic conditions. Thus, we hypothesised that serum MK levels would in increase in patients with OSA. Materials and methods: Patients who underwent full polysomnography with suspicion of OSA were eligible for the study. Serum MK and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were compared between OSA and control groups. Results: Twenty-four control and 53 patients with OSA were enrolled in the study. Median serum MK level was significantly lower in the OSA group than that in the control group (85.93 vs. 131.86 pg/mL, respectively; p = 0.001). No significant correlation was detected between OSA severity and serum MK level. Median serum CRP level tended to be higher in the OSA than that in the control group (2.8 vs. 2.05 mg/L, respectively; p = 0.075), but the difference was significant only in patients with severe OSA compared with those in the control group (43 vs. 2.05 mg/L, respectively; p < 0.01). Conclusion: Unexpectedly lower serum MK levels were found in patients with OSA than those in the control group, but the mechanism underlying this condition is unclear.

Bronchial inflammation is an expected condition also in pulmonary tuberculosis and may play role in the extent of parenchymal infiltration. It is conceivable that EBC pH may be an useful marker in demonstrating the extent of airway inflammation in tuberculosis patients; however, there is limited clinical data about its role in pulmonary tuberculosis. In this prospective study we aimed to investigate the inflammation of the airways by EBC pH and to evaluate the relationship between the degree of smear positivity and the radiological extent of tuberculosis. Materials and methods: 19 untreated smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis cases and 31 healthy controls were included in the study. While the control group was investigated for only EBC pH, the patient group was investigated for EBC pH, chest X-ray, serum procalcitonin level and acido-alcohol resistant bacilli examination in sputum smear. Available parameters were compared statistically between healthy controls and patients. Results: Mean EBC pH was found to be significantly low in tuberculosis group (p <0.001). In the patient group, there was a moderate negative correlation between EBC pH and ARB positivity (p <0.02), moderate positive correlation between serum procalcitonin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p <0.02), moderate positive correlation between serum procalcitonin and radiological extent (p <0.008), a strong positive correlation between erythrocyte sedimentation rate and radiological extent (p <0.003). However, any statistically significant correlation was not observed between EBC pH and radiological extent. Conclusion: In this study it has been demonstrated that EBC pH was in association with pulmonary inflammation in tuberculosis and smear positivity but had no relationship with parenchymal infiltration. On account of this, we state that EBC pH may be useful in the assessment of the airway inflammation and bacillary load, but is not a good predictor of radiological extent of pulmonary tuberculosis.","[Tasci, Canturk; Dogan, Deniz; Aydogan, Mehmet; Ocal, Nesrin; Deniz, Omer; Tozkoparan, Ergun; Bilgic, Hayati] Gulhane Mil Med Acad, Dept Pulm Med, Ankara, Turkey; [Ozkaya, Sevket] BahcesehirUniversity, Med Pk Hosp, Chest Dis, Samsun, Turkey; [Tapan, Serkan] Gulhane Mil Med Acad, Dept Biochem, Ankara, Turkey","Ocal, N (corresponding author), Gulhane Mil Med Acad, Dept Pulm Med, Ankara, Turkey.",,"BİLGİÇ, HAYATİ/AAC-8764-2021; Ozkaya, Sevket/AAE-4521-2020; ocal, nesrin/D-4118-2016","BİLGİÇ, HAYATİ/0000-0001-5208-3053; Ozkaya, Sevket/0000-0002-8697-4919; ",,,,20,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,747.0,751,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_84,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400013,,,,,2022-07-14

Although mortality risk factors have been investigated in previous studies, there is not sufficient data about the prognostic roles of tracheostomy and central venous catheterization (CVC) in patients with AB bacteremia. Therefore, we performed this study to assess the risk factors associated to mortality from AB bacteremia in intensive care unit (ICU) with a new perspective. Materials and methods: Data of 90 adult patients with AB bacteremia hospitalized between 01 January 2010 and 01 December 2014 in ICU were evaluated retrospectively. The results were assessed in terms of 14th and 28th day mortality rates. Results: The 14th day and 28th day mortality rates for patients with AB bacteremia were 31.1 % and 48.9 %, respectively. The 14th day non-survivors were more likely to have chronic kidney disease, insertion of subclavian and femoral CVC compared to survivors. While tracheostomy, jugular CVC, absence of CVC, higher serum albumin and lower procalcitonin (PCT) levels were observed significantly more common in survivors; higher high-sensitivity CRP, higher PCT, and lower albumin levels were significantly more common in mortality group. Risk factors associated with 14th day mortality were high serum PCT (p<0.001), lack of tracheostomy (p=0.004) and CVC location (p=0.007). Whereas, 28th day mortality was associated with chronic kidney disease, malignancy, insertion of subclavian and femoral CVC. High serum PCT (p<0.001), lack of tracheostomy (p=0.001) and CVC location (p=0.006) were determined as independent predictors for 28th day mortality. Conclusion: These data reveal that lack of tracheostomy and presence of subclavian or femoral CVC are independent risk factors for 14th and 28th day mortality, and high PCT level is a good predictor for poor prognosis in ICU patients with AB bacteremia. According to our knowledge, this study contributes to current literature in terms of being the first study focused on the prognostic roles of tracheostomy and CVC in patients with AB bacteremia.","[Taskin, Gurhan; Ocal, Nesrin; Ozer, Serhat; Yamanel, Levent] Gulhane Mil Med Fac, Dept Intens Care, Ankara, Turkey; [Ozturk, Kadir] Gulhane Mil Med Fac, Dept Gastroenterol, Ankara, Turkey; [Turker, Turker] Gulhane Mil Med Fac, Dept Hlth Publ & Epidemiol, Ankara, Turkey; [Cakar, Mustafa] Gulhane Mil Med Fac, Dept Rheumatol, Ankara, Turkey","Taskin, G (corresponding author), Gulhane Mil Med Fac, Dept Intens Care, Ankara, Turkey.;Taskin, G (corresponding author), Gulhane Askeri Tip Akad, TR-06010 Ankara, Turkey.",,"Taskin, Gurhan/AGQ-8182-2022; ocal, nesrin/D-4118-2016",,,,,26,1,1,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1891.0,1897,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_179,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300023,,,,,2022-07-14

Method: 210 samples of seven brands of internal and imported high consumption packed rice in Iran were selected each brand whereof consisted of 30 samples which were evaluated in terms of contamination with Pb, Cd and As. The evaluation was performed through graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and atomic fluorescence spectrometry methods; afterwards, their concentrations were compared to MAC. Finally, their safety was calculated for the human health. Results and conclusion: The average concentrations of Pb, Cd and As in high consumption rice cultivated in or imported to Iran were 0.061, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/kg respectively. The results of this study showed that the weekly intake of these heavy metals in all rice brands was below provisional tolerable weekly intake. These findings suggest that all evaluated high consumption brands are below 1 in terms of health risk index and are safe for the human health in the present study.","[Tavakoli, Hamid Reza; Rostami, Hossein] Baqiyatallah Univ Med Sci, Hlth Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Farsani, Mehrdad Khosravi] Shahid Chamran Univ Ahvaz, Fac Vet Med, Ahvaz, Iran; [Rastegar, Hossein] Minist Hlth & Med Educ, Cosmet Prod Res Ctr, Food & Drug Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran","Rostami, H (corresponding author), Baqiyatallah Univ Med Sci, Hlth Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran.",hosein_rostami59@yahoo.com,,,Baqiyatallah university of medical sciences [94/6/3-85],This manuscript was extracted from research project approved (grant number: 94/6/3-85) by Baqiyatallah university of medical sciences.,,19,5,5,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,4.0,,1543.0,1547,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YQ,WOS:000392283200036,,,,,2022-07-14

Based on visualization technique, this study demonstrates changes, after leg bath in decoction, at knee joint synovium of rats with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and the efficacy of this therapy is further discussed. Methods: Ninety male Wistar rats were randomly and equally assigned to six groups: Health Group, Model Group, Prednisone Acetate Gavage, Rheumatism Decoction Gavage, Hot Water Bath, and Rheumatism Decoction Bath. After 14 days of experiment, MRI data of knee synovium thickness and smoothness of all groups were collected, analyzed and cross compared. Results: Due to death or other reasons, data of 43 rats were finally obtained: 11 in Health Group, 7 in Model Group, 5 in Group of Hot Water Bath, 5 in Group of Prednisone Acetate Gavage, 5 in Group of Rheumatism Decoction Gavage, and 10 in Group of Rheumatism Decoction Bath. Comparison was made among MRI results of knee synovium from different groups in aspects of volume rendering, density, horizontal and vertical measurement, boundary curve, and smoothness of the boundary. The result showed that there was huge difference between Health Group and that of Model Group; all data of Group of Rheumatism Decoction Bath were better than any other groups and were the closet to those of Health Group. Conclusion: Based on application of visualization techniques, the results can be directly perceived by means of MRI, which showed leg bath in decoction can significantly improve the thickness and smoothness of knee synovium in rats with rheumatism, and its effects are superior to gavage of prednisone acetate or rheumatism decoction, with the placebo effect ruled out (since the result of this group is better than that of Hot Water Bath).","[Tian, Guihua; Tang, Xiaoyi; Wang, Yongxue; Liu, Changxin] Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Dongzhimen Hosp, Massage & Pain Dept, Beijing 100700, Peoples R China; [Tian, Guihua] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Chinese Evidence Based Med Ctr, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Shifeng; Deng, Qingqiong; Wang, Xuesong] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xu; Li, Shuzhen; Tang, Yan] Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China","Liu, CX (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Dongzhimen Hosp, Massage & Pain Dept, Beijing 100700, Peoples R China.",31314165@qq.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [81273690]; Beijing Nova Program [XX2014B049],Funding for this work was provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81273690) and Beijing Nova Program (XX2014B049).,,18,0,0,0,12,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1873.0,1879,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_176,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300020,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: Thirty-two consecutive patients (7 women and 25 men; mean age: 65.0 +/- 9.4 years, range: 43-78 years) with internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis were examined by CEUS and DSA. The studies were performed using a Hitachi Preirus ultrasound machine for CEUS and Allura Xper FD20 system (Philips Medical Systems, Nederland B.V.) for DSA. The contrast-enhancing agent used was 1.2 ml SonoVize (Bracco, Switzerland),In addition, the performances of CEUS and DSA in assessing the patency of ICA and suitability of CEA (carotid endarterectomy) were explored. Results: There was no significant difference between the distributions detected by CEUS and DSA for the four groups. The diameter stenosis percentage measured by CEUS strongly correlated with the DSA image measurements. CEUS reliably identified patients with good sensitivity and specificity at the three cut-off values of 100%, 70%, and 50%. CEUS performed better than DSA in assessing the patency of ICA and suitability of CEA.

Various criteria have been used for the diagnosis and classification of acute renal failure, including RIFLE (Risk-Injury-Failure-Loss-End stage), AKIN (Acute Kidney Injury Network) and most recently KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes). Many studies have only evaluated urinary output or serum creatinine when categorizing ARI. Our aim was to determine the predictors of mortality in intensive care patients treated with CRRT and to compare mortality with ARI level as determined by KDIGO-Serum Creatinine (KDIGO-SCr) and KDIGO-urinary output (KDIGO-UO) Materials and methods: This retrospective study was performed on intensive care patients receiving CRRT at our institute between January 2010-December 2011. Patient files were reviewed and demographic data, hospitalization time, laboratory findings, CRRT commencement and ARI levels were noted. Results: Seventy patients were included in the study. Mortality was found to be associated with patients' age, Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and adjusted predicted death rate. (p<0,01). Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) area under the curve was statistically significant for determination of mortality using KDIGO-SCR (p<0.01) although the same was not true for KDIGO-UO (p>0.05). Conclusions: We believe that RIFLE, AKIN, KDIGO criteria are each good predictors of mortality. In the case of KDIGO criteria, based solely on serum creatinine or urinary output, KDIGO-SCr was found to be a better predictor of mortality when compared to KDIGO-UO.","[Tulgar, Serkan] Pendik State Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, Anesthesiol & Reanimat, Istanbul, Turkey; [Cakiroglu, Basri] Hisar Intercontinental Hosp, Dept Urol, Urol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Cevik, Banu Eler] Dr Lutfi Kirdar Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, Anesthesiol & Reanimat, Istanbul, Turkey; [Karakilic, Evvah] Ankara Numune Training & Res Hosp, Dept Emergency, Emergency, Ankara, Turkey; [Ates, Nagihan Gozde] Gumushane State Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, Anesthesiol & Reanimat, Gumushane, Turkey; [Gergerli, Ruken] Karakocan State Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, Anesthesiol & Reanimat, Elazig, Turkey; [Ozdemir, Erman] Dr Lutfi Kirdar Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Nephrol, Istanbul, Turkey","Tulgar, S (corresponding author), Maltepe Univ, Facul Med, Feyzullah Caddesi 39, Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Tulgar, Serkan/AAE-2589-2019; Cakiroglu, Basri/H-8401-2019","Cakiroglu, Basri/0000-0001-5337-5226",,,,20,0,0,1,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,773.0,778,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_88,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400017,,,,,2022-07-14

Chronic viral hepatitis D continues to be a significant health problem in certain regions of the world. Rates of response to currently proposed treatments are rather low. The aim of this study was to investigate oxidative stress in patients with chronic viral hepatitis D. Materials and methods: A total of 91 patients with chronic hepatitis D virus infection were included in this study (mean age: 42.2 +/- 11.7). In addition, 40 healthy volunteers were included in the study to form the control group. Patients were divided into two main sub-groups as cirrhotic (n=30) and non-cirrhotic (n=61) groups. Blood samples were taken from both patients and control subjects and compared for total oxidant status (TOS), total anti-oxidant status (TAS) and oxidative stress index (OSI). Results: TOS levels were significantly higher in the patients compared to the control sub-jects (p<0.001). Moreover, TOS levels were higher in the cirrhotic patients compared to the non-cirrhotic patients (p=0.006). TAS levels were significantly lower in the patients compared to the control subjects (p=0.003). OSI levels were significantly higher in the patients compared to the control subjects (p<0.001). Moreover, OSI levels were higher in the cirrhotic patients compared to the non-cirrhotic patients (p<0.05). Conclusion: These results are supportive of the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of chronic viral hepatitis D. Antioxidant therapies might be considered in patients with chronic viral hepatitis D considering the presence of oxidative stress in these patients.","[Ucmak, Feyzullah; Ekin, Nazim; Tuncel, Elif Tugba; Yalcin, Kendal] Dicle Univ, Sch Med, Dept Gastroenterol, TR-21100 Diyarbakir, Turkey; [Solmaz, Ihsan] Siverek State Hosp, Internal Med Clin, Sanliurfa, Turkey; [Kaplan, Ibrahim] Dicle Univ, Sch Med, Dept Clin Biochem, Diyarbakir, Turkey; [Senates, Ebubekir] Medeniyet Univ, Sch Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Istanbul, Turkey","Ucmak, F (corresponding author), Dicle Univ, Sch Med, Dept Gastroenterol, TR-21100 Diyarbakir, Turkey.",,,,,,,31,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1865.0,1871,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_175,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300019,,,,,2022-07-14

The aim of this study is to investigate the prolidase enzyme levels as a disease activity indicator in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Materials and methods: The study included 60 patients diagnosed with RA according to the 2010 RA Classification Criteria and 30 healthy controls. The patients were divided into subgroups according to the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS 28), as low disease activity (DAS 28 <= 3,2) and high disease activity (DAS 28 > 5,1). Serum prolidase activity (SPA) was determined by a photometric method based on the measurement of the proline levels produced by prolidase. Results: There were significant differences between RA patients and healthy controls with respect to prolidase activity. Prolidase activity was significantly higher in the patients with RA than those of the controls (P = 0.001). However, no statistically significant difference was found between the high and low disease activity groups. In correlative analysis, prolidase positively correlated with rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies. Conclusion: Increased prolidase levels are related to increased oxidative damage, bone and collagen turnover. SPA in clinical practice may be a useful method for predicting the joint erosion and progression of the disease.","[Ugan, Yunus; Dogru, Atalay] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Dept Internal Med, Div Rheumatol, Fac Med, TR-32000 Isparta, Turkey; [Sezen, Hatice] Harran Univ, Fac Med, Dept Biochem, Sanliurfa, Turkey; [Kucuk, Adem] Malatya State Hosp, Div Rheumatol, Dept Internal Med, Malatya, Turkey","Dogru, A (corresponding author), Suleyman Demirel Univ, Dept Internal Med, Div Rheumatol, TR-32000 Isparta, Turkey.",,,,,,,20,1,1,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,313.0,316,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000006,,,,,2022-07-14

Although multiple agents have been used to minimize this pathology, I/R injury remains a challenging problem. In this study, we investigated the effectivity of escin on hepatic I/R injury. Materials and methods: Hepatic I/R injury was determined in rats by the clamping of the hepatic artery and portal vein for 60 minutes, followed by 60-minute reperfusion. Escin 10 mg/kg (i.p.) was administered 30 minutes prior to ischemia and 30 minutes prior to reperfusion. Liver function tests were evaluated by the assessment of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, the radical oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated by the assessment of malondialdehyde (MDA), and the antioxidant activity was evaluated by the assessment of glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Samples of liver tissues were histopathologically evaluated. Results: The results revealed that serum AST, ALT, and LDH and the MDA levels were lower both in the pre-ischemia and pre-reperfusion escin groups. The CAT and SOD levels were higher in the pre-reperfusion escin group. Histopathologic injury was lower in the rats administered with escin. Discussion: In this study, it was demonstrated that escin provides useful outcomes since it reduces ROS formation when administered prior to ischemia and removes ROS when administered prior to reperfusion.","[Ugras, Daban; Mustafa, Ugur; Seckin, Akkucuk; Gazi, Ozbilen Orhan; Cem, Oruc; Erol, Kilic; Akin, Aydogan] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Sch Med, Dept Gen Surg, TR-31100 Serinyol, Hatay, Turkey; [Oguzhan, Ozcan] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, TR-31100 Serinyol, Hatay, Turkey; [Mehmet, Yaldiz] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, TR-31100 Serinyol, Hatay, Turkey","Mustafa, U (corresponding author), Mustafa Kemal Univ, Tip Fak, Genel Cerrahi AD, TR-31100 Serinyol, Hatay, Turkey.",,,,Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of Mustafa Kemal University,This study was granted by Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of Mustafa Kemal University.,,32,2,2,1,8,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,4.0,,,,,973.0,979,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_118,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DY1XF,WOS:000384887000018,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: Alcohol and drug abuse groups constituted of male abusers who presented to a local Alcohol and Drug Abuse Research Center. Control groups were composed of age-matched healthy men who denied any drug/alcohol abuse. Each group was composed of 30 men. Beck Depression and Anxiety Scales, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OAB-V8), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) and sexual satisfaction scale were the tools applied to the subjects and controls. Additionally, maximum (Qmax) and average urinary flow rates (Qave) were recorded for statistical assessment in all groups. Results: The mean age, number of children, number of siblings, were comparable between the subjects and controls (p> 0.05). LUTS and ED were more prevalent in drug and alcohol abusers when compared with their controls. Higher mean depression and anxiety scores of the drug and alcohol abusers highlighted their worse psychological status. The quality of life and sexual satisfaction assessment of the drug abusers yielded significantly lower results when compared with their controls. Regarding the comparison between alcohol addicts and their controls; quality of life scores were significantly higher whereas sexual satisfaction assessment results were comparable. The Qave values were similar between drug abusers and their controls while mean Qave was significantly higher in the alcohol addicts than their controls. Conclusion: ED and LUTS are more prevalent in alcohol and drug abusers when compared to healthy controls. It can be proposed that alcohol and drug addiction should be considered in the etiology of ED and LUTS especially in young adult population.","[Uluocak, N.; Atilgan, D.; Parlaktas, B.

Methods: A total of 1071 patients, admitted to 8 different state hospitals' ophthalmology clinics around the country, were included to this cross sectional multicentred study. All diabetic patients were asked to respond specifically prepared questionnaire including diabetic retinopathy and diabetes mellitus and underwent fundus examination to assess the diabetic retinopathy level. Results: The mean age of the study population was 57.5 years and the 57.4 % of the patients were women. 34.7% of the patients' were responded NO to the question of Are you aware of the eye complications of diabetes mellitus?. The study also showed that 200 of 699 patients (28.6%) who aware of the diabetic retinopathy, despite having this information do not have regular eye examination for the diabetic retinopathy. It was seen that even 40.62% (26/64) of the college graduates don't go regular checks. The majority of the aware patients (40.5 %) pointed out that they took information from internal medicine or endocrinologists and the 28.1% of the patients were informed from elsewhere (family, neighbor, TV, etc.). Conclusion: One third of the subjects monitored were not aware of diabetic retinopathy. It is noteworthy to emphasize the importance of the routine eye examination for preventing vision loss, regardless of the educational level. The warning of the physicians through written and visual media is thought to be effective in preventing irreversible condition of this disease.","[Ulusoy, Mahmut Oguz] Baskent Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, Konya Res Hosp, Konya, Turkey; [Kivanc, Sertac Argun] Uludag Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, Fac Med, Bursa, Turkey; [Atakan, Mehmet] Aksaray State Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Aksaray, Turkey; [Uzun, Ozgur] Isparta State Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Isparta, Turkey; [Ozturk-Sahin, Bilge] Buca Seyfi Demirsoy State Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Izmir, Turkey; [Olcaysu, Osman Okan] Erzurum Res Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Erzurum, Turkey; [Karatepe, Arzu Seyhan] Kayseri Res Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Kayseri, Turkey; [Zorlu-Ozturk, Sibel] Batman State Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Batman, Turkey; [Turker, Ibrahim] Van Res Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Van, Turkey","Ulusoy, MO (corresponding author), Baskent Univ, Konya Res Hosp, TR-42000 Konya, Turkey.",,"Kıvanç, Sertaç Argun/AAH-6518-2021",,,,,32,1,1,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,4.0,,,,,925.0,931,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_111,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DY1XF,WOS:000384887000011,,,,,2022-07-14

In contrast to be acknowledged the possible role of Fetuin-A in the development of atherosclerosis, its association with vascular changes in SCA appears to warrant further investigation. In the study, we aimed to illuminate vascular pathophysiology of SCA via investigating Fetuin-A levels and its relationship with oxidative stress parameters. Material and methods: Fourty SCA patients and and 35 healthy individuals (n: 35) were included in the study all. After analyzing hematological data, Malondialdehyde (MDA), Glutathione Peroxidase (GSH-Px), Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT) were measured throughout preparing hemolysate from samples with EDTA. Fetuin-A was analyzed from serum samples. Results: Fetuin-A (p<0.001) and MDA levels (p<0.001) were measured significantly higher in SCA group. Similarly, G6PD (p<0.001) and SOD (p<0.01) enzyme activities were determined higher in SCA when compared to the control group. A novel positive correlation was found among Fetuin-A, G6PD (r=0.435, p<0.0001) and MDA (r=0.547, p<0.0001). However, there was no statistical significance between the groups for CAT and GSH-Px.

Rotavirus and enteric adenovirus are among the most common causes of viral diarrhoea among young children worldwide. The aim of this study of samples sent to the laboratory with an initial diagnosis of gastroenteritis was to define the prevalence of rotavirus and enteric adenovirus according to age and seasonal distribution. Materials and methods: The presence of rotavirus and enteric adenovirus antigens was researched using a qualitative immunochromatographic method in stool samples from patients with gastroenteritis who were admitted to Ondokuz Maps University Hospital between January 2009 and April 2013. Chi-square tests were used for comparisons between groups. Results: Of the 2185 stool samples examined, 343 were determined to be positive for rotavirus antigen and 157 for adenovirus antigen. The highest rate of rotavirus antigen positivity (212 cases, 62%) was seen in the 0-23 months age group. Seasonally, rotavirus gastroenteritis was seen mostly in winter (144 cases, 42%). The highest rate of adenovirus positive samples was determined in the 0-23 month's age group (86 cases, 55%). The distribution of the adenovirus cases in autumn, winter, spring and summer was 54 (34%), 31 (20%), 27 (17%) and 45 (29%) cases, respectively. Sixty-three specimens (3% of cases) were positive for both antigens. Conclusion: As rotavirus and adenovirus were found to be significant factors in gastroenteritis in the 0-23 months age group, in the differential diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis in this age group of patients, it is important to consider rotavirus as a factor, particularly in the winter months, while adenovirus should be considered in summer and autumn. Rotavirus and adenovirus can be diagnosed quickly by the immunochromatographic test from stool samples, making it possible to prevent the development of dehydration and the unnecessary use of antibiotics.","[Unal, Nevzat] Adana Numune Educ & Res Hosp, Microbiol Lab, Adana, Turkey; [Yanik, Keramettin; Eroglu, Cafer] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Samsun, Turkey; [Aydogdu, Sema] Bafra State Hosp, Microbiol Lab, Samsun, Turkey; [Gunaydin, Murat; Hokelek, Murat] Istanbul Univ, Cerrahpasa Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Istanbul, Turkey","Unal, N (corresponding author), Adana Numune Educ & Res Hosp, Microbiol Lab, Adana, Turkey.",,"Hokelek, Murat/AAR-8507-2020","Unal, Nevzat/0000-0001-5121-3100",,,,32,5,5,6,8,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,81.0,85,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700012,,,,,2022-07-14

Its daily release is regulated by the hypothalamic-hypophyseal-adrenal axis. In healthy people, an adequate amount of endogenous corticosteroids is synthesized in the adrenal gland in response to stressful events, but in patients with adrenal insufficiency, there is a steroid synthesis defect that prevents the patient's requirements from being met. It may be challenging to diagnose corticosteroid deficiency in some circumstances, which can lead to catastrophic consequences, including death. Case presentation: In this article, we report a patient who had been using prednisolone 5mg/day for 10 years for rheumatoid arthritis with acute gastroenteritis whose clinical condition deteriorated despite appropriate therapy for 1 week and who was subsequently diagnosed with secondary adrenal insufficiency.

Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is a transcription factor which plays an important role in the normal physiology of the thyroid and lungs. TTF-1 is highly specific and sensitive in the diagnosis of certain types of primary lung and thyroid carcinomas and immunohistochemical TTF-1 positivity may be used as a marker of malignancies metastasized from lung and thyroid. Although they are used extensively in daily pathological practice, detailed study of this antibody in some of neoplasms that may show difficulties in differential diagnosis is lacking. In this study, we aimed to determine the usefulness of TTF-1 positivity in the differential diagnosis of gastric carcinomas from lung malignancies. Materials and methods: We examined TTF-1 expression in primary adenocarcinoma and non-cohesive carcinoma of the stomach. Surgical resection materials from 132 patients with gastric carcinoma were evaluated. The diagnosis of primary site was identified for all cases by clinical, radiological and/or histological correlation and the possibility of metastatic carcinoma was excluded. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the tissue-microarray block sections. Results. Among 123 gastric carcinomas, 4 (3.25%) cases showed strong nuclear positivity with TTF-1. None of the 9 poorly cohesive gastric carcinomas stained for TTF-1. Conclusions: In summary, our results show that TTF-1 positivity may be observed especially in gastric adenocarchioma.","[Vardar, Enver; Basmaci, Guldidar; Comut, Erdem; Cavdar, Demet Kocatepe; Erkan, Nazif; Ilhan, Enver] SB Izmir Training Teaching Hosp, Dept Pathol, Izmir, Turkey; [Vardar, Baran Umut] Izmir 9 Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Radiol, Izmir, Turkey","Vardar, E (corresponding author), SB Izmir Training Teaching Hosp, Dept Pathol, Izmir, Turkey.",,"vardar, enver/AAB-1508-2020",,,,,17,1,1,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,753.0,756,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_85,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400014,,,,,2022-07-14

All participants received at least 60 minutes of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2) at 2.5 atmospheres absolute (ATA). Standard blood gas analysis was performed on 10 mL venous blood samples obtained immediately before and after HBO2. Seven biomarkers and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels were measured. Results: Following HBO2, all patients recovered fully and were discharged in stable condition. Significant differences between pre and post HBO2 values were found in three of the seven biomarkers analyzed: TNF-alpha, IL-10, and S100B. Additionally, S100B and NSE levels were significantly different from controls for the 10 patients who experienced temporary loss of consciousness (LOC), and IL-6 levels were significantly different from controls for all CO-intoxicated patients. Conclusion: Conclusive evidence of a correlation between a single biomarker and LOC patients was not found. However, the data suggests that the significance of the fall between pre and post HBO2 values for TNF-alpha and IL-10, along with the resolution of IL-6 levels, may herald the severity of the patient's neurological condition.","[Vezzani, Giuliano; Caberti, Leonardo; Cantadori, Luca; Manelli, Daniele; Mordacci, Marco] Vaio Hosp, Parma, Italy; [Socias, Stephanie; Mangar, Devanand; Camporesi, Enrico M.] Florida Gulf To Bay Anesthesiol Associates LLC, Tampa Gen Circle, Tampa, FL USA; [Bianco, Antonino] Univ Palermo, Sport & Exercise Sci Res Unit, Via Giovanni Pascoli 6, I-90144 Palermo, Italy; [Paoli, Antonio; Bosco, Gerardo] Univ Padua, Dept Biomed Sci, I-35100 Padua, Italy","Bianco, A (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Sport & Exercise Sci Res Unit, Via Giovanni Pascoli 6, I-90144 Palermo, Italy.",,"Bianco, Antonino/AAB-8023-2020; Paoli, Antonio/A-6151-2015; Bianco, Antonino/AAI-7451-2020","Paoli, Antonio/0000-0003-0474-4229; Bianco, Antonino/0000-0001-8334-6581; BOSCO, GERARDO/0000-0001-6595-7944",,,,13,4,4,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,189.0,193,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700029,,,,,2022-07-14

Results: Compared with controls, mRNA expressions of alpha/beta subunit (ITGAD, ITGAL, ITGAM, ITGAX and ITGB2), ligands of integrin beta 2 (RAGE, JAM-1, Fibrinogen, ICAM-1, ICAM-3, ICAM-5 and uPAR), chemokine (fMLP and RAF), inside-out signaling pathway (RIAM, ADAP, SLP-76, PLC gamma, RAPL, SPA1, alpha-actinin, calpain, Dok1, radixin, talin and 14-3-3 zeta) and outside-in signaling pathway (Fgr, Hck, Lyn, PKC, c-abl, Syk, Vav1/3, cdc42, mDia, Rac, RhoA and ROCK1/2) in AMI patients were significantly upregulated. However there was no significant difference of gene expressions of integrin beta 2 and its signaling pathway in SA patients compared to control group. Conclusions: The inside-out signaling pathway was downregulated generally in AMI patients, but not in SA patients. However, the outside-in signaling pathway was activated to be upregulated in AMI patients, but not in SA patients. Thus, the activation of integrin beta 2 was irritated by external factors.","[Wen, Siwan; Jin, Yun; Wang, Lemin] Tongji Univ, Tongji Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Shanghai 200065, Peoples R China","Wang, LM (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Tongji Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Sch Med, 389 Xincun Rd, Shanghai 200065, Peoples R China.",,,,Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine 3-year Development Program,This study was supported by the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine 3-year Development Program (2014-2016).,,32,2,2,1,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,303.0,312,,,,10,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000005,,,,,2022-07-14

Neuroscience is an emerging research field, which contributes to revealing the mechanisms of decision-making behavior. This study investigated the influence of emotion on decision-making in herd behavior and the cognitive characteristics in group incidents from a two-stage experiment. The behavior data demonstrated that herd behavior really existed in group incidents, and interaction between emotion and participation rate influenced the decision making. When participation, rate was 0% or 25%, compared with the negative emotion, decision makers who felt positive emotion tended to choose not to participate in the herd behavior. When the rate rose to 75%, compared with the positive emotion, the decision-makers in negative emotion may be more inclined to herd behavior. The ERP analysis of the emotion presentation demonstrated, an increased early, negativity (NI) and attenuated early negativity (N2) elicited by an angry or sorrowful mood compared with positive emotion. The weakness of early negativity (N2) would make people experience less struggle while making decisions, and it also led to an increase in the amplitude of P3, which reduced the difficulty of decision making.","[Xiong, Guoqiang; Jiang, Meng; Liu, Xi] Xian Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Xian, Peoples R China","Xiong, GQ (corresponding author), Xian Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Xian, Peoples R China.",,,,NSFC [71173171],This study was supported by NSFC (No.71173171).,,30,3,3,0,16,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,1.0,,489.0,496,,,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DN9SI,WOS:000377420600004,,,,,2022-07-14

Materials and methods: Amplification of DNA was monitored through visual inspection of calcein pre-addition and 2% agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE). The optimal reaction system was found to be composed of 150 mM Mg-2+, 50 mu M calcein as well as the 1:8 ratio of Mn-2+ and calcein. Orange to green color change and ladder like multiple bands of different sizes could be inspected in only E. coli O157:H7. Results: The sensitivity of LAMP assays was approximately 10 pg/mu L and significantly prior to 10 ng/mu L of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In the parallel diagnosis of 66 E. coli samples, 36 (54.55%) strains were positive for rfbE. Of these 36 O157:H7, 31 (86.11%) and 29 (80.56%) were positive for stx1 and stx2, respectively.

They are composed of a benign epithelial component and a cellular, spindle cell stroma forming a leaf-like structure. No one morphologic finding is reliable in predicting the clinical behavior of the tumor. The rarity of phyllodes tumor and similarity to fibroadenoma necessitate studies and case series presentations delineating differential characteristics. We aimed to present our phylloides tumor experience to make contribution to the knowledge in the literature. Materials and method: This retrospective study includes 414 patients (62 Phyllodes tumor and 352 fibroadenoma)that were diagnosed and treated at Izmir Bozyaka Education and Research Hospital between January 2005 and January 2013. Patients demographic findings, tumor characteristics, diagnostic and treatment modalities and also their follow-up results were examined. Multivariate regression analysis and ROC curve were structured in order to see the significance. Results: The mean age was 42.5 (22-62) and mean tumor diameter was 4.4 (1,2-15) cm in phylloides tumor group. Breast preserving surgery was the preferred treatment of 52 and total mastectomy in 10 patients out of 62 phylloides tumor. The mean follow up time interval was 51 and 66 months for breast preserving and mastectomy patients respectively in phylloides tumor group. Recurrent cases in phylloides tumor group were respectively (12.5%) and 5 (12.5%) in breast preserving and mastectomy patients. Tumor size and patients age were found to be concordant with the type of histopathology (benign, borderline and malignant) of the phylloides tumor. Tumor size was found to be correlated with phylloides tumor diagnosis rather than fibroadenoma. Conclusion: Histopathologically more aggressive phylloides tumor is more likely in bigger tumor size and older age. This is also true in differential diagnosis of fibroadenoma in suspicion of phylloides tumor. The lesions greater than 3 cm should always be surgically excised with clear surgical margins.","[Yildirim, Mehmet; Carti, Erdem Baris; Ucar, Ahmet Deniz; Erkan, Nazif; Yakan, Savas; Sipahi, Ozgur Esen] Izmir Bozyaka Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Izmir, Turkey; [Vardar, Enver] Izmir Bozyaka Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Pathol, Izmir, Turkey; [Adibelli, Zehra] Izmir Bozyaka Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Radiol, Izmir, Turkey","Erkan, N (corresponding author), Izmir Bozyaka Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Surg, TR-35350 Izmir, Turkey.",,"Ucar, Ahmet Deniz/O-4435-2014; Yildirim, Mehmet/Y-7939-2018; Adibelli, Zehra Hilal/ABE-8234-2020; vardar, enver/AAB-1508-2020","Ucar, Ahmet Deniz/0000-0002-2678-3133; Adibelli, Zehra Hilal/0000-0001-9265-8114; ",,,,21,1,1,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,157.0,161,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700024,,,,,2022-07-14

Left-sided atrial septal pouch (LASP) is associated with potential cardioembolic stroke. This study determines the association between LASP and cryptogenic stroke (CS) using cardiac multi-detector computed tomography (cMDCT) angiograms. Materials and methods: This study included 40 patients with CS (23 males, mean age: 403 +/- 10.4 years) and 40 age- and sex matched healthy controls. cMDCT examinations by dual-source 64-slice MDCT with 0.6-mm slice thickness were performed for all patients and controls. The association between LASP and risk of CS was assessed after adjustment for other stroke risk factors. Results: Patients with LASP were younger than control subjects (41.3 +/- 7.2 years vs 44.2 +/- 5.7 years; p = 0.066), with a comparable prevalence of hypertension (42.5% vs 35%; p = 0.491) and other risk factors. There were no differences in the prevalence of LASP between patients and controls (32.5% vs 25%; p = 0.621). LASP was observed in 43.5% (n = 10) of normotensive stroke patients compared to 15.4% (n = 4) of normotensive controls (Odds Ratio (OR): 4.23, 95% CI: 1.09-16.27, p = 0.063). On the other hand, LASP was detected in 17.6% (n = 3) of hypertensive CS patients compared to 42.9% (n = 6) of hypertensive controls (OR: 028, 95% CI: 0.05-4.23, p = 0.253). The presence of LASP was not associated with an increased risk of CS. Conclusion: This study suggests that LASP is associated with CS. However, in normotensive individuals, LASP may be a minor risk factor for CS.","[Yilmaz, Murat] May State Hosp, Dept Neurol, Ankara, Turkey; [Vural, Mustafa Gokhan] Sakarya Univ, Fac Med, Dept Cardiol, Adapazari, Turkey; [Karcaaltincaba, Musturay] Hacettepe Univ, Fac Med, Dept Radiol, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Yoldas, Tahir Kurtulus] Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Fac Med, Dept Neurol, Ankara, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Muhittin Serkan] Ankara Numune Training & Res Hosp, Emergency Dept, Ankara, Turkey; [Kavalci, Cemil] Baskent Univ, Fac Med, Emergency Dept, TR-06490 Ankara, Turkey","Kavalci, C (corresponding author), Baskent Univ, Fac Med, Emergency Dept, Bahcelievler Ankara, Turkey.",,"Karcaaltincaba, Musturay/A-3866-2016; YILMAZ, MURAT/AAD-2829-2021","Karcaaltincaba, Musturay/0000-0002-3384-0909; Vural, Mustafa Gokhan/0000-0002-7055-0492",,,,14,8,7,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,785.0,789,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_90,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400019,,,,,2022-07-14

It has a wide range of pharmacological activity. Recent studies have found that lycorine has significant effect on the hematological malignancies. However, the effect of lycorine on the Human breast cancer MCF-7 cells (MCF-7) are not clear. In this context, we studied that lycorine induced the apoptosis of MCF-7 cells, and explored the possible mechanism of it. Materials and methods: The MCF-7 cells were treated with different concentrations of lycorine for 72h. The inhibition rate of the MCF-7 cells was detected with Brominated tetrazolium (MTT) assay, cell morphology was observed using an inverted microscope, the change of cell intracellular calcium and membrane potential was detected with confocal laser scanning microscope. Results: MTT assay showed that lycorine could inhibit the MCF-7 growth in dose-dependent manner after 72h. The MCF-7 cells were rupture and dead under inverted microscope. Calcium concentration in MCF-7 cells significantly increased and membrane potential were decreased in dose-dependent manner. Disscussion: These results showed that lycorine could inhibit the MCF-7 cells growth and induce it apoptosis, the mechanism might involve an initiation of apoptosis signals in the mitochondrial pathway.

An in-depth retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 1230 cases (observation group) of congenital heart disease children with dexmedetomidine for anesthesia induction who received surgery from January 2014 to June 2015. The Main research parameters were specific indicator changes in diastolic pressure, systolic pressure, heart rate before and after anesthesia induction in children. The usage frequency of isoflurane among 1230 children was also recorded. To fully demonstrate the impact of dexmedetomidine on anesthesia hemodynamics, the researchers selected 1,000 cases (control group) of children with midazolam who underwent congenital heart surgery during the same period for comparative analysis, with the same parameters as those in the observation group. The study results show that after operative anesthesia, systolic pressure and heart rate of both groups of children decreased significantly; during surgical incision, heart rate, diastolic pressure, systolic pressure increases in the control group children were more obvious than those in the observation group; meanwhile, the observation group children received less isoflurane, With significantly lower frequency compared to the control group.

Epidemiological studies related to various diseases have a key role in diagnosing the sources of contamination, transmission routes, prevalence and spread of various diseases (e.g. varied poisonings) and prevention and control approaches. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of acute poisonings caused by consuming food, chemical and pharmaceutical compounds at Imam Khomeini Hospital of Kermanshah during 4 years (2009-2012). We extracted the research data on food, chemical and pharmaceutical poisonings from Imam Khomeini Hospital of Kermanshah during this period of time using 165, 2610 and 3073 records of hospitalized patients in the hospital, respectively. After classifying the data regarding the objectives of the study, they were analyzed by using Excel and SPSS software. We used chi-square test to determine the association between the different variables and poisoning incidence. The results showed that most food, chemical and pharmaceutical poisonings had accrued in spring and summer. They recorded an increase in food poisoning incidence and a decrease in chemical and pharmaceutical poisonings from 2009 to 2012. The incidence of food and chemical poisonings was reported higher in men than in women, while gender differences in the incidence of drug poisoning were quite opposite. Among age groups, the highest incidence for each poisoning occurred in the age group of 30-15 years. Besides, the association between incidence of food, chemical and pharmaceutical poisonings and year, season, month, gender and age groups was significant (Pvalue<0.001). Therefore, responsible organizations need to take steps to train the public and broaden its knowledge of food hygiene and proper usage of chemicals and pharmaceuticals by employing different means (radio, television, newspapers, etc.), considering the significance of this association.","[Ziapour, Arash] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Kermanshah, Iran; [Pirsaheb, Meghdad; Hemati, Lida; Asadi, Fateme; Sharafi, Kiomars] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, RCEDH, Kermanshah, Iran; [Karimaei, Mostafa] Semnan Univ Med Sci, Aradan Sch Publ Hlth & Paramed, Dept Environm Hlth Engn, Semnan, Iran; [Karimaei, Mostafa; Azari, Ali; Sharafi, Kiomars] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Ghafari, Hamid Reza] Hormozgan Univ Med Sci, Social Determinants Hlth Promot Res Ctr, Bandar Abbas, Iran","Sharafi, K (corresponding author), Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, RCEDH, Kermanshah, Iran.;Sharafi, K (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Engn, Tehran, Iran.",kio.sharafi@gmail.com,"azari, ali/AAA-2177-2019; pirsaheb, meghdad/H-5415-2017; Ziapour, Arash/AAJ-9043-2020; Asadi, Fateme/Q-8256-2019; Sharafi, Kiomars/CAF-0682-2022; Ghaffari, Hamid Reza/AAU-3024-2020","azari, ali/0000-0002-6004-6954; Ziapour, Arash/0000-0001-8687-7484; Ghaffari, Hamid Reza/0000-0002-0029-1616; pirsaheb, meghdad/0000-0001-9189-772X",Kermanshah University of medical sciences [92053],The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of carrying out this project (Grant Number: 92053) from Kermanshah University of medical sciences.,,39,5,5,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,2.0,,933.0,940,,,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SU,WOS:000390175400013,,,,,2022-07-14

The present study was an attempt to investigate the patient satisfaction with medical services provided by one of the hospitals in Kermanshah, Iran. Materials and methods: in this descriptive cross-sectional study, 406 inpatients were randomly selected and included in the study. The instrument for data collection comprised of a standard patient satisfaction questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and inferential statistics (independent t-test and ANOVA). Results: the mean score of the patients' total satisfaction with inpatient services was 3.49 out of 5. The maximum and minimum levels of satisfaction were reported for the domains of behavior of medical and administrative staff (3.65 +/- 0.96) and environmental hygiene of hospital (3.26 +/- 73.0). The patients' total satisfaction was different in terms of gender and age variables; however, it was not statistically significant in terms of education, career, residence, inpatient ward and reason of patient's referral. Conclusion: although the patients' total satisfaction with inpatient services was favorable, the patients were dissatisfied with hospital facilities. Hospital managers can proceed to increase the patient satisfaction with medical services by eliminating the factors causing dissatisfaction.","[Ziapour, Arash] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Kermanshah, Iran; [Khatony, Alireza] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Social Dev & Hlth Promot Res Ctr, Kermanshah, Iran; [Jafari, Faranak] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Kermanshah Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Kermanshah, Iran; [Kianipour, Neda] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Students Res Comm, Kermanshah, Iran","Khatony, A (corresponding author), Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Social Dev & Hlth Promot Res Ctr, Kermanshah, Iran.",akhatony@kums.ac.ir,"Ziapour, Arash/AAJ-9043-2020; khatony, alireza/M-8348-2017","Ziapour, Arash/0000-0001-8687-7484; ",Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences [93058],This article was drawn from a research project (No. 93058) sponsored by deputy of research and technology of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences.,,51,9,9,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,2.0,,959.0,965,,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SU,WOS:000390175400017,,,,,2022-07-14

The study method was correlational. The statistical population consisted of first grade female students of second high school in Kabudrahang in 2014-15. The sample size was estimated to be 210 individuals through Cochran formula. In so doing, multi-stage cluster sampling was employed. Data collection was carried out using Zajacova, Lynch and Espenshade academic stress questionnaire and Savari's procrastination survey. The results of Pearson correlation coefficient indicated that there is a direct significant relationship between female students' academic stress and the dimensions of intentional procrastination, procrastination caused by physical and mental fatigue, and procrastination caused by disorganization. The results of stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that in the second step, the dimensions of procrastination caused by mental and physical fatigue and also intentional procrastination can predict and explain 49% of changes in female students' academic stress. Therefore, it can be concluded that students' academic stress will decrease with a drop in their procrastination.","[Zohreyi, Tahereh] Islamic Azad Univ, Hamedan Branch, Educ Psychol, Hemedan, Iran; [Erfani, Nasrollah] Payame Noor Univ, Dept Psychol, Tehran, Iran; [Jadidiyan, Ahmad Ali] Islamic Azad Univ, Kangavar Branch, Kangavar, Iran","Erfani, N (corresponding author), Payame Noor Univ, Dept Psychol, Tehran, Iran.",erfani@pnu.ac.ir,,,,,,38,1,1,4,18,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,4.0,,1257.0,1264,,,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YQ,WOS:000392283200011,,,,,2022-07-14

First, the osteoporosis conditions of diabetic rats were assessed, then their BMMSCs were cultured to make the experimental group. At the same time, BMMSCs taken from normal rats were cultured as the control group. In the final stage, differently expressed miRNA were singled out using deep sequencing technology. Results: The result showed that 8 weeks after the rats were induced to diabetes by streptozotocin (STZ) intraperitoneal injection, the density of their humerus was lower, their BV/TV (bone volume relative to tissue volume)was smaller and the trabecular spacing was greater than the wistar group. In addition, 10 pieces of miRNA were selected for their striking differences. Conclusion: By the significant enrichment information in pathway, the Notch signal pathway could regulate the diabetic osteoporosis BMMSCs.
