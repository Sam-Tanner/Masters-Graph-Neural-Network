AB Let G be a graph, then the dominator coloring of G is a proper coloring, in which every vertex of G dominates every vertex of at least one color class. The Total dominator coloring of graph is a proper coloring with extra property that every vertex in the graph properly dominates an entire color class. The total dominator chromatic number x(d)(t) (G) of G is the minimum number of color classes in a total dominator coloring of it. In this paper, total dominator coloring of dense, octahedral and queen's graphs have been disscussed.

AB This paper describes the results of experiments on the magnetization of barium hexaferrite particles embedded in lyotropic liquid crystals. The carrier liquid crystal medium was an aqueous solution of a mixture of sodium lauryl sulfate and lauric acid in a ratio 2/1. Barium hexaferrite particles were stabilized with two layers of surfactant. The first layer consisted of oleic acid molecules. Second layer was a mix of sodium lauryl sulfate and lauric acid in a ratio 1/1. The process of particle magnetization was investigated by observing the effect of birefringence. The intensity of light passing through the system of crossed polaroids and the time of its establishment were measured depending on the magnitude of the magnetic field and the concentration of the components of the liquid crystal. It was found that the field dependence of the birefringence effect changes significantly depending on the concentration of the liquid crystal. In a concentrated solution in the liquid-crystalline phase, a significant enhancement of the birefringence effect is observed in weak fields. As the concentration of the solution decreases, the field dependence of the birefringence effect smoothly transforms into the curve for particles dispersed in water.

AB Intelligent load scheduling is an emerging approach that has the potential to facilitate extreme sustainable data center (DC) operation. However, scarcity of straightforward tools in the public domain challenges decision makers performing quantitative analysis of the DC load planning and its potential benefits. In this work, a novel integrated decision-making framework was developed to address this issue, which provides the basis for the multi-objective optimization of carbon-, water-, and economic-intelligent load scheduling. The proposed framework was demonstrated with a case study DC in California, which showed the usefulness of the proposed framework in informing sustainable DC operations.

AB The stability of water supply systems is one of the main factors that determine the reliability of the functioning of large industrial complexes. This problem is considered on the example of the "Azot" branch of URALCHEM JSC in the city of Berezniki, which takes fresh industrial water from the Kama river (Kama reservoir). A specific feature of this water body is the significant variability of its hydrological regime. During the summer dry season, it is characterized by low flow velocities. In winter, with a decrease in the water level in the reservoir, a typical river regime is observed. In addition, there is a strong technogenic impact on the water body. The impact is formed largely due to non-declared dispersed (diffuse) sources. Their characteristic feature is high mineralization and, accordingly, the density of the formed wastewater. Their behavior is fundamentally different from the processes of dilution and migration of effluents with neutral buoyancy. A two-layer structure is formed, when the content of the main ions in the surface horizon is more than an order of magnitude less than in the bottom layer. This circumstance must be taken into account when assessing the reliability of the functioning of water intakes. The most effective tool for solving such problems is the conjugation of a complex of field monitoring observations with computational experiments using hydrodynamic models in one-, two- and three-dimensional formulations.

AB This research is a preliminary study to determine students' initial knowledge of applying physics material in the environment. Environmentally oriented physics learning is essential to do, especially in the process of developing students' higher-order thinking skills which include problem-solving skills, critical thinking skills, creative thinking skills, and metacognitive abilities. The research was conducted using a survey method on 115 students in several schools in Nganjuk, East Java. The research data includes the selection of physics material that can show a relationship with environment-based learning and the types of high-order thinking skills of students which will be further developed through subsequent research. The results showed that students considered the thermodynamics material as closely related to interactions with the environment Also, there are materials on Global Warming and Temperature and Heat. Simultaneously, the high-order thinking skills that are expected to be developed in environment-based physics learning are critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities.

AB Effects of three kinds of columnar defects in NbSe2 single crystals introduced by 320 MeV Au irradiation with a dose equivalent matching field B-Phi up to 4 T were studied. Through the magnetization measurement using a SQUID magnetometer, two pronounced peak effects in the external field dependence of critical current density (J(c)) were observed in crystals introduced with splayed and tilted columnar defects. In crystals with splayed columnar defects, J(c) at the peak field reaches the maximum for splay angle theta(CD) = +/- 10 degrees, which is a little different from that found in YBa2Cu3O7 and iron-based superconductors, where optimal. theta(CD) is equal to +/- 5 degrees.

ID EXCESS HEAT
AB District heating networks (DHN) combined with low-carbon heat sources are a promising way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from heating. However, few works have addressed the problem of allocating localised thermal energy supplies to DHN heating demands considering the spatial proximity constraint of transporting heat energy. The work improves an existing spatiotemporal analysis method by introducing an adapted form of Hitchcock transportation problem and linear programming to solve the optimal allocation problem in network of supplies and demands. The new method is compared with the original method and is found to improve the accuracy of estimating the allocable industrial excess heat supply in a Swiss case study. The method could be applied to diverse thermal sources, such as industrial excess heat, geothermal, lakes and rivers, etc.

ID MYOPIA; OUTDOORS
AB Children between the ages of 6 and 14 spend much of their day in school classrooms, where they are exposed to only a fraction of the daylight quantities typical for natural outdoor conditions. This paper examines unilaterally and bilaterally illuminated classrooms in terms of quantitative and qualitative requirements for daylighting in classrooms during both winter and summer. The results of measurements and simulations pointed out the advantages of bilaterally illuminated classrooms when compared to unilaterally illuminated ones. In winter, the windows placed on two opposite walls provide a significantly higher uniformity of daylight. In summer, in addition to the improved uniformity, this window arrangement offers higher variability in shading strategies, resulting in greater availability of daylight and better visual comfort. These factors can potentially prevent or limit the development of myopia.

AB Prosumer-dominated thermal networks interconnect distributed prosumers. These networks form the infrastructure that allows to execute the trading of thermal energy as desired in the context of local energy markets. However, the significantly different behavior of such networks compared to conventional district heating and cooling networks has not yet been comprehensively investigated. This paper provides a compilation of instrinsic characteristics of prosumer-dominated thermal networks and discusses challenges that arise from these characteristics. As a basis for the investigations an underlying reference concept for the considered type of networks is described. Simulative case studies are combined with scientific deduction and literature references to gain new insights on the design and operation of this type of networks. It is found that due to the variability in these networks, the definition of a design case is a challenge for the dimensioning of concrete network implementations. To anticipate the strong coupling between prosumers and the nonlinear network behavior, it is concluded that centralized control combined with a model of the physical network behavior is necessary. The discussion of characteristics and challenges in prosumer-dominated thermal networks indicates open points in this field and thus provides a starting point for consecutive studies.

AB Cementitious composites are common construction material for infrastructures. Their abundant resources are one of the reasons why they are widely consumed. The drawback of these materials is its brittle nature resulting in unavoidable cracking problems in the infrastructures. Further, the crack will initiate the corrosion of steel reinforcement and reduce structural durability. Calcium carbonate precipitating bacteria are the potential to heal the cracks in the cementitious composite if they are selected and treated carefully. This paper reviews different types of bacteria applied in concrete, and the methods can be used as a healing agent. This study recommends using bacterial cementitious composites as self-healing material, surface treatment, and crack healing agent.

AB The modern built environment is now connected. Multiple software and protocols are used in buildings of many kinds, thus creating a fascinating and heterogeneous environment. Within this context, applied research can be complicated and would benefit from a single data location across projects and users. The first version of BBData tried to solve this problem, BBData v2.0 is an update with a better-defined scope and a new codebase.
   The solution has been open sourced and simplified with a full software rewrite. Its components are now state-of-the-art and proven to be stable in industrial settings. The achieved performances have been thoroughly tested. Together with its new architecture, BBData v2.0 now accommodates the needs of modern experiments; efficient for simple proof of concepts while keeping the possibility to scale up to city-level projects. This flexibility makes BBData a good candidate for research while being able to scale in production settings.

AB In this study, an optical filter based on a plasmonic metal-insulator-metal (MIM) coupled waveguide resonator is simulated and investigated. Using the proposed structure leads to realizing a filter function between targeted wavelengths by manipulating the appropriate geometrical parameters of the resonators. Two-dimensional FDTD-based simulation is implemented to analyze the filter properties. The filter proposed proves to be a potential candidate for highly integrated optical circuit applications.

AB Supercapacitor is a promising solution to storage of pulsed energy generated by MEMS energy harvesting systems, relying on its faster charging/discharging capability than secondary battery. To improve the energy density of on-chip supercapacitor which shows potential for integration with MEMS devices, in this paper we first present a successful electrode design for high specific energy pseudo-supercapacitors on the basis of deep reactive ion etched Si nanowire array supported nano-carbon matrix. Widely used pseudo-capacitive manganese oxide active material is facilely deposited into the conductive nano-carbon matrix by a chemical bath deposition. The derived electrode exhibits a remarkable capacitance increase (around 4.5x enhancement) compared with the nano-carbon matrix benefiting from the contribution of pseudo-capacitive manganese oxide. Assembled sandwich prototype on-chip supercapacitors with a symmetric configuration offer a high specific capacitance of 741.6 mF cm(-2) when discharged at 1 mA cm(-2), and the energy density can attain as high as 51.5 mu Wh cm(-2). The achieved high specific energy makes such on-chip supercapacitors attractive in the field of energy collection when cooperated with micro- or nano- energy generators.

AB The use of georeferenced information system and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data in combination with traditional data analytics tools is very promising in urban scale engineering and especially in energy urban planning. This paper explores the use of new DH networks for industrial waste heat exploitation and for that purpose, a case-study in Vitoria-Gasteiz (Spain) is proposed. The methodology explained in this paper explores the incorporation of data from industrial emplacements, buildings and road network in order to identify optimal areas in the city for the construction of a new district-heating network. An area of influence of a buffer of radius 1.5km from the industry location is defined and the proposed algorithm divides this area into grids of different sizes. The path for the network is calculated by optimizing the economic performance of the network. The results show that the district-heating may be built in the south-west direction from the industry and among the 40 configurations studied, payback periods from 6 to 8.5 years are obtained.

AB This research based on the students' difficulty in solving problem in triangle and quadrilateral topic. The difficulties can be identified from the mistakes made by students when solving triangle and quadrilateral problems. It can be caused because of learning obstacle experienced by the students. The learning obstacle which was described on this research is only focused on ontogenic obstacle. The purpose of this research is to identify the ontogenic obstacle based on the mistakes of the students in topic of triangle and quadrilateral. This research used a qualitative approach. The research was conducted to 25 grade VII students in one of junior high schools in Sumedang and a teacher as participants. Furthermore, the students answered 5 questions in test given and then the researcher interviewed 3 students based on their answers on the test. The researcher analysed the data of this research by using triangulation method from data of students' answer on the test given, also interview of the teacher and the students. The result of this research showed that the researcher identified the ontogenic obstacles experienced by the students on topic of triangle and quadrilateral. The first ontogenic obstacle is psychological ontogenic obstacle where the student were less interested to the learning process of triangle and quadrilateral topic. The second ontogenic obstacle is instrumental ontogenic obstacle where the student were mistaken to recognize the guideline line on the picture given, and the last ontogenic obstacle is conceptual ontogenic obstacle where the student did not understand the topic of quadrilateral well based on the learning experience of the student in measuring length and area.

AB This article is a review articles on three levels of chemical representation until 2020. The method used in this research is document analysis. We obtained 72 articles published within 11 years (therefore, 2009-2020) that discussed the level of chemical representation. The results obtained were 50.67% of researchers using the term macroscopic, submicroscopic, and symbolic levels which were different from the original ideas of Johnstone. In addition, we found 15 new terms for 3 levels of chemical representation. Furthermore, the scope of macroscopic, submicroscopic, and symbolic levels becomes richer and broader.

AB In this paper we present the results of numerical simulation of nonlinear regimes of a NaCl aqueous solution in a square cavity with rigid and impermeable for substance boundaries. The vertical boundaries are thermally insulated, there are different constant temperatures on horizontal ones, it corresponds to the heat from below. The calculations are carried out within the non-stationary approach, with using of Boussinesq approximation and taking into account the polynomial dependence of the thermal diffusion coefficient on temperature. According to experimental data, the sign of thermal diffusion coefficient of the mixture under study changes at a temperature 285.4 K. In this work we consider a temperature range such that the sign of the thermal diffusion coefficient changes inside the simulated region. Other transport coefficients factors are considered as constant. The calculations were carried out for the cases of Earth and reduced gravity. A comparison is made with the case of the thermal diffusion coefficient constant value, which is negative at the considered average temperature.

AB The paper is devoted to the numerical study of two-dimensional convective motion of a viscoplastic fluid in a closed region under lateral heating. The problem is solved numerically using the ANSYS Fluent software. The Bulkeley-Herschel model describing viscoplastic behavior was chosen as a non-Newtonian fluid model. Under certain rheological parameters, this model is reduced to a Newtonian fluid model, the behavior of which is also investigated as a limit case. Based on the results of the calculations, the dependence of the maximum value of the stream function in the cavity on the Rayleigh number is plotted and the evolution of the unyielded zones with an increase in the Rayleigh number is traced. The threshold value of the Rayleigh number, at which a sharp growth of the flow intensity is observed, has been determined. The calculated threshold value of the Rayleigh number for the Bulkley-Herschel liquid was found to be very close to the threshold value of the Rayleigh number at which the flow of the Bingham liquid arises, which was obtained analytically.

ID SORET DIFFUSION
AB The behaviour of the ternary hydrocarbon mixture of toluene-methanol-cyclohexane in mass proportion 0.62/0.31/0.07 is studied. The direct numerical simulation is carried out for the two-dimensional closed cavity heated from above. The mixture is supposed to be in the gravity field. The behavior of the mixture is predominantly caused by the Soret effect (thermal diffusion). An important parameter, responsible for the Soret effect, is the net separation ratio, Psi. For the mixture under consideration, the two sets of values of Psi are known. In both cases, the values of Psi turn out to be close to zero, but in one case. is slightly positive, and it is slightly negative in the second one. This results in qualitative difference in the evolution of the mixture under consideration. If Psi > 0, the mixture comes to the mechanical equilibrium. If Psi < 0, we observe the system to be at the border of stability, under small perturbation there is no instability, but for the perturbation amplitude higher than a threshold value of the convective single-vortex flow arises.

AB This study identifies the initial ICT skills and basic competencies of learning technology for students in learning basic physics. This research was conducted in three different universities in Makassar Indonesia. The research instrument is a test instrument for the basic competency test of learning technology, and a non-test instrument in the form of a learning technology capability questionnaire. The results showed that the average percentage of student learning technology competence in three tertiary institutions in Makassar was level 1 with a percentage of 94.39%; level 2 57.50%; level 3 78.17%; level 4 67.77%; level 5 76.03%; and level 6 67.55%. This shows that the competency of student learning technology for level 1 is in the very good category, and levels 3 and 5 are in the good category. While at level 4, and 6 are in the medium category, while at level 2 it is still in the bad category. The initial ability of learning technology on the attitude aspect is in the high category while the social emotional aspect is also in the moderate category. This shows that the use of learning technology really needs special attention to the social emotional aspects, especially ethics. Therefore, it can be said that the relationship between the initial ability of student learning technology and its use as a medium for learning basic physics is very close. The ability of good learning technology will have the potential for the use of good learning technology.

AB Urban Building Energy Simulation (UBES) is an efficient tool to investigate and subsequently reduce energy demand of urban areas. Nevertheless, UBES has always been a challenging task due the trade-off between accuracy, computational speed and parametrization. In order to reduce these computation and parameterization requirements, model reduction and simplification methods aim at representing building behaviour with an acceptable accuracy, but using less equations and input parameters. This paper presents the development and validation results of a simplified urban simulation model based on the ISO 13790 Standard and written in the Modelica language. The model describes the thermo-physical behaviour of buildings by means of an equivalent electric network consisting of five resistances and one capacitance. The validation of the model was carried out using four cases of the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 140. In general, the model shows good accuracy and the validation provided values within the acceptable ranges.

ID MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY
AB This paper describes the work carried out to assess the use of a quartz reference rubidium Rb-(87) vapor cell for non-invasively magnetoencephalography, avoiding cryogenically cooled sensors as the Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs). An experimental setup based on a cylindrical glass vapor cell of Rb-87 (1= 75 mm, d = 19 mm) was developed. The Rb-87 cell was heated to around 75 degrees C and it was optically pumped with polarized light (range 750-850 nm), tuned to the D1 transition of rubidium, for spin-polarization of the atoms, and the intensity of the light transmitted through the cell was detected using a photodiode. Without magnetic field, the photodiode current is maximized but when a small transverse magnetic field is present a measurable drop in light transmission occurs. A Magnetic Shielded Box (MSB) made by a nickel-iron ferromagnetic alloy, was used for nulling background magnetic fields and the transmittance light versus transverse magnetic field intensity (100-1000 nT) was measured.

AB Suitable lighting control strategies are essential for energy efficiency in buildings. Occupancy sensors are highly promoted by the building codes as one of the most cost-effective solutions in the sector. However, widespread use of these systems is still limited due to lack of user satisfaction. In this study, it is hypothesized that the "conventional use" of occupancy sensors (where user steps inside a dark area, and only afterwards the area becomes lit) is the reason behind the dissatisfaction. To overcome this problem, a new user-centric sensor-based lighting control approach is proposed in this study where users walk into an already lit area. An experiment was carried out in the circulation areas of a university building to test the feasibility of the proposed scenarios along with a conventional occupancy sensor scenario and the existing "no sensor" scenario. The main results revealed that the conventional use of occupancy sensors was not favoured by the participants in circulation areas while use of the proposed user-centric approach was as favourable as the existing constantly lit situation. It is the claim of this study that both energy efficiency and user satisfaction can be provided by the use of user-centric control systems.

ID PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT
AB This paper aims to fill the gap in knowledge about building control testing, thus encouraging control evaluation, to ultimately improve energy efficiency in building operation. A hardware controller and its digital twin are tested in real-time in a separate platform in the cloud, and the results are analyzed to determine what insights can tests on virtual controllers give about the behaviors of their real-life hardware counter-parts. Key performance indicators (KPIs) from literature are used to evaluate the control. It is shown that although the controllers differ in their control output time-series, their overall performance profile along the entire simulation run follows a similar pattern (KPI percent error varies between 3% and 8%). This implies that virtual controller testing can be a good indicator of hardware controller behavior.

AB The concept of integrating programmable low-cost cameras into the office infrastructure and BMS for real-time, web-based sensing and control of the luminous environment in buildings is presented in this study. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential of predicting the luminance field perceived by an office occupant using a programmable calibrated HDR camera installed at the rear side of a computer monitor or on the wall behind the occupant, for a variety of sky conditions and shading options. The generated luminance maps using Python scripts with OpenCV packages were further processed to extract daylighting and glare metrics using Evalgare. The results showed that: (i) among the different camera resolutions that were compared, the 330x330 resolution was selected as the best option to balance between accurate capturing of visual environment and comfort and computational efficiency; (ii) a camera sensor embedded on the rear side of a computer screen could capture interior visual conditions consistently similarly to those viewed by the occupant, except for sunny conditions without proper shading protection. This prototype study paves the way for luminance monitoring and daylight control using programmable low-cost camera sensors embedded into the office infrastructure.

AB The modelling of mooring lines and their behaviour is essential for the research and development of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs). Mooring lines' dynamics impact the platform motions and hence the loads on the turbine's blades. Therefore, coupling the mooring lines' dynamics in the aero-hydro-servo-elastic models is a necessity. In this paper we couple Moordyn to SIMPACK which is a multibody system simulation software. Afterwards, we verify the coupling by comparing the results to OpenFAST v2.1. The IEA Wind 15 MW reference wind turbine coupled to Activefloat and WindCrete floaters, introduced in COREWIND project, are used for the verification process. The two floaters have two different mooring configurations; WindCrete is a spar floater with a symmetric delta shape catenary mooring line system, while Activefloat is a semi-submersible with simple catenary mooring configurations. During the verification, both steady and dynamic load cases are used for the responses of two mooring systems. After the verification, the coupling procedure is open access and can be used to model new innovations in FOWTs using SIMPACK benefiting from the tool's flexibility.

AB This work investigates the flexoelectric potential of titanium oxide thin films regarding their microstructural and electrical properties to be integrated into nanoscaled resonators. Flexoelectricity is an electromechanical effect that can result in deformation of a material due to a polarization gradient and can outperform piezoelectric effects at the nano scale. The flexoelectric constant is linearly dependent on the permittivity and therefore we determined TiO2 as a suitable flexoelectric material because of its high permittivity, its CMOS compatability and its linearity with respect to polarization. TiO2 capacitors with various electrode materials are evaluated in order to achieve the c-axis oriented (110) rutile growth, thus to exploit the highest permittivity. The permittivity ranges from 65 to 95, with TiO2 on IrO2 electrodes representing the highest value achieved in this study. As expected, the IrO2/TiO2/IrO2 capacitors show an almost constant impedance up to 200 kHz and have leakage current density values of similar to 10(-3) A/cm(2) at 0.5 MV/cm at room temperature.

AB Although the influence of urban form on microclimate and building thermal processes has been acknowledged, few studies have addressed the influence of overheating mechanisms on heterogeneous urban fabrics for existing historical cities. This study investigates the impact of changing urban climate on indoor temperatures by focusing on three Venice morphological patterns. Through microclimate modelling techniques, outdoor and indoor temperatures are simulated in 2020 and 2050 scenarios. Results show that the compactness of the urban fabric contributes to reducing indoor building temperatures. The analysis suggests that the increased density of shadow areas can mitigate the outdoor temperature values and reduce direct radiation on facades. When comparing the two climate scenarios 2020 and 2050, average indoor temperatures increase in the latter. However, the analysis highlights that the absence of insulation and the relatively high thermal mass of typical Venetian envelopes plays a crucial role in the building thermal processes preserving indoor comfort in a warmer climate future.

AB This study aims to develop a tool to determine the refractive index and height of objects in three media based on the principle of light refraction. The method used was an experimental method. The results showed the refractive index values of the three media were quite accurate when compared to the absolute refractive index. The relationship of the angle of the incident ray was directly proportional to the angle of the refractive ray. The angle of light produced will be greater if the value of the given beam angle was greater. Thus, the set of refractive index laboratory tools developed is said to be good and suitable to be implemented in schools to explain the concept of the refractive index of light.

AB Athens' extensive urbanisation, lack of green areas and the extreme heat caused by increasingly frequent heat waves indicate the need for actions improving indoor and outdoor comfort, which is closely related to the energy consumption of the buildings. This work's aim is to create a carbon neutral block in Athens on the 2050 horizon. The optimization of the block's form based on principles of environmental design and climatic analysis was performed to enhance its environmental benefits. Simulations on the energy performance of the block and calculations on the ability to cover the energy loads by renewables were conducted. Finally, to meet the zero-carbon neutrality, a connection with the neighbouring blocks was established. The results demonstrate the benefits of a bioclimatic, carbon neutral building design in Athens and provide a practical prototype, which can be adapted in other projects, thereby enabling the shift to a more efficient and environmentally friendly built environment.

AB This research was conduct to determine the situation of learning mathematics physics online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants in this study were physics semester 4th students of Universitas Muhammadiyah Makassar with 21 students. Data collection techniques include online interviews and questionnaires. The collected data analyzed by reduction, display, and conclusion drawing. The results of the study describe the learning process of mathematical physics not conducive during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. The problem that arises in the form of difficulty lectures in teaching explicit physics material that has many mathematical formulas and calculations. The difficulty on the part of students is that students experience limited costs to buy internet quota in online learning. The lecturer provides the solution by creating a mathematical physics module that is given in stages. This module is presented with language and examples of questions that are easily understood by students through the google classroom application. Lectures also occasionally use the zoom application, and Google meets to explain the material that is difficult to understand.

AB This research project compared a standard vapor compression system and a standard desiccant dehumidification system with heat wheel to determine if there was some potential energy savings for "shoulder season" hours in Austin Texas. "Shoulder season" hours as defined in the paper are hours during which the dry bulb temperature falls within the American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) comfort bound but the humidity is above the comfortable humidity point. These hours are normally addressed with vapor compression systems which dehumidify by cooling the air under the comfort setpoint to dehumidify, which is wasteful of energy. The study found that for these shoulder season hours a desiccant dehumidification system was around 4.5 times more energy efficient at reaching comfort setpoints if free heating was used for drying the desiccant.

AB This research is motivated by long distance learning and the importance of critical thinking ability. Several previous studies relating to critical thinking ability were about understanding students' critical thinking ability based on gender and students' characteristics of lower and upper group critical thinking ability. However, almost no research could be found on students' critical thinking ability who have learned with problem-based learning model through e-learning and students' characteristics of middle critical thinking ability. Therefore, this study aims to identify students' critical thinking ability who have learned with problem-based learning model through e-learning. The method in this study was qualitative with case-study approach. We gave a learning with problem based learning model through e-learning and a written test to 36 students on 8th grade students of one junior high school in Banyumas, Central Java. Then, we conducted interviews to 2 upper group students, 2 middle group students, and 2 lower group students. The results show that the students with upper, middle, and lower group critical thinking ability have different characteristics in each indicator of critical thinking ability. Meanwhile, the student who have learned with problem-based learning models through e-learning dominant in middle group critical thinking ability.

AB Education is currently demanded to be able to provide 21st century skills to students so that they can be successful in the world of work and life in the future. One of the 21st century skills of particular concern is Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) which plays an important role for students to be able to solve a problem collaboratively. This study aims to obtain an overview of CPS skills of students in the pursuit of physics. CPS is analyzed through two domains, social skills and cognitive skills. The subjects in this study were students of grade 10 in a public high school in Riau. Data is collected by giving problems of application of parabolic motion in everyday life. Students' answers on answer sheets and recorded conversations of students are then analyzed using a rubric of CPS skills. The results showed that CPS skills of students in social skills and cognitive skills are still dominated in the low and middle categories. This result does not contain all the indicators developed by Hesse et al. several obstacles were also found in the assessment process. For this reason, further research is recommended to assess all indicators and use computer-based assessments.

AB Oasis settlements are the most common form in the Saharan regions of North Africa, identified by a strong harmony between urban forms and palm groves, which present the economic capital for these regions. On the other hand, these oases are significantly growing and impacting the people's livelihood and thermal well-being, especially during summer season. This study aims at first to identify the close correlation between cultivated area (palm grove) and the built-up area throughout the Tolga Oasis Complex in Algeria, which is recognised by its palm groves and well-known as one of the largest oasis settlements of the Saharan regions in North Africa. Furthermore, the current work assesses the impact of palm groves by investigating the 'oasis effect' on the thermal heat stress levels during July and August daytime hours within 9 conducted stations. Suprisingly, the so-called oasis effect generated by palm groves was insignificant during the extreme hot days. On the other hand, the palm groves were extremly hot affected by a warming effect during daytime hours.

AB After its discovery, photoinduced chirality in azopolymer materials has been studied with growing interest because of its potential applications. According to our previous investigations, it is possible to induce chirality in an amorphous azopolymer with a high linear photoanisotropy by illumination with elliptically polarized light. In the present work, we studied the photoinduced chirality in thin nanocomposite films based on the azopolymer poly[1-[ 4-(3-carboxy-4-hydroxyphenylazo)benzenesulfonamido]-1,2-ethanediyl, sodium salt], shortly PAZO, doped with TiO2 nanoparticles with a size of about 20 nm. The thickness of the prepared films was approximately 550 nm and the concentration of the nanoparticles varied from 0 to 3 wt. %. A He-Cd laser beam (lambda = 442 nm) was used, with the input ellipticity varying from -1 (left circularly polarized) to +1 (right circularly polarized). The ellipticity was set using a quarterwave and a half-wave plates. We studied the dependences of the output ellipticity and the angle of self-rotation of the polarization azimuth on the input ellipticity. Based on the experimental data obtained, we could analyze the dependence of the self-rotation of the polarization azimuth on the concentration of the nanoparticles. The results show that small concentrations of nanoparticles lead to an enhancement of the self-rotation, hence, the chirality.

AB The results of numerical modeling (in ANSYS) are presented, concerning the effect of the local residual stress field in the vicinity of the crack tip on the fatigue crack growth rate and change of the crack trajectory. Static indentation by a spherical indenter is considered as a method for creating a residual stress field. In this case, the point (or points) of indentation can be located both symmetrically relative to the line of initial crack orientation and with an offset. It is shown that the fatigue crack can grow in the direction opposite to its initial orientation. This effect can be employed to control the fatigue crack growth trajectory.

AB Residential external wall assemblies are among the key contributors to embodied carbon emissions in the building industry. Their design, however, is still largely oriented towards linear consumption trajectories of extraction-use-waste. Within this context, this paper investigates how established material recovery potential assessment metrics could be used to inform design decisions aimed at improving circularity in buildings. A redesign of a typical timber frame assembly is presented and its material recovery performance is compared to standard systems. Results show a 35%-47% improvement in material recovery potential.

ID WIND FARMS; PARAMETERIZATION
AB This work focuses on the study of interactions between neighboring wind farms through a mesoscale numerical modelling approach. High resolution simulations with three wind farm parameterizations (WFP, EWP and IAWFP), implemented on the WRF model, over a set of "real world" neighboring onshore wind farms are performed. The sensitivity of the three parameterizations to wake development is analyzed. The older version of the WFP is also included to account for differences between versions in terms of wake length and intensity, and TKE production and advection. Finally, the impacts of upstream wind farms are studied through a series of simulations where they are "disabled" and the increases in power at downstream farms are quantified. These results and the adopted methodology have direct application and are highly relevant for the feasibility assessment of new wind farms in the shadow of other existing ones.

AB Dominating set is a set D of vertices of graph G(V, E) and every vertex u is an element of V (G) - D is adjacent to some vertex v is an element of D. The set D is called independent set if no two vertices in D are adjacent. Independent domination number of G is the minimum cardinality of D and denoted by gamma(i)(G). The metric representation of vertex v in connected graph G with respect to an ordered set W = (1), w(2), w(3), ..., w(k) of vertices is the k-vector r(v vertical bar W) = (d(v vertical bar w(1)), d(v vertical bar w(2)), d(v vertical bar w(3)), d(v vertical bar w(k))), where d(v, w) represents the distance between the vertices v and w. The set W is resolving independent dominating set for G if W is independent in G, and distinct vertices of G have distinct representations with respect to W. The minimum cardinality of resolving independent dominating set is called resolving independent domination number and denoted by gamma(ri)(G). In this paper, we analyze the resolving independent domination number of path graph, cycle graph, friendship graph, helm graph, and fan graph.

AB Second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy is an effective analytical tool for a detailed investigation of the microscopic structure of non-centrosymmetric molecules. We developed a four-channel photon-counting-based Stokes polarimeter integrated to the SHG microscope for spatial characterization of polarization effects in the SH signal. We implemented Stokes-vector-based polarization-resolved SHG imaging to perform quantitative polarimetry, with a view to applications in biomedicine, which can measure the full polarization state of the SH light. In this work, we describe the application of a Stokes-vector-based four-channel photon counting SHG microscope to determine the molecular interpretation of the SH light from collagen in normal, scar, and keloid tissue.

AB This paper explores the preliminary design of the support structures for the IEA Wind Task 37 reference wind farm at the Borssele site III and IV. The study looks at two different design methods that might be used within larger wind farm system design optimization (i.e. lay-out, electrical systems, etc.). The first consists of a scaling tool that scales a detailed design according to the rated power, water depth, hub height and rotor diameter. The second is a physics-based optimization approach that relies on the WISDEM (R) design tool. This research compares the results of these two methods for the design of both the tower and monopile of the IEA 10-MW and 15-MW reference wind turbines at a range of sea depths (25 m, 30 m, 35 m, 40m). The two tools yield very similar results in terms of monopile base diameter, support structure natural frequency and mass. WISDEM is then used to also investigate the sensitivity of the design to the tower top forces, wave conditions and the soil conditions. It is shown that tower top forces dominate the design. In general, large diameter structures can carry additional costs associated with manufacturing and transportation requirements. Thus, the paper is concluded with a trade-off study between mass and diameter that quantifies the effect of the reduction in monopile diameter with the increase in structural mass.

AB The German and European climate action programs and the ongoing discussion of resource efficiency require an in-depth analysis of the building sector, especially with the background of the German refurbishment backlog and high energy demands of the German building stock. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) on the city quarter level allows fast and efficient evaluation of environmental impacts, emissions, and energy demands of densification in urban areas. This study presents LCA results for a specific urban city quarter. Thereby environmental and energetic values for specific building ages are developed and used to conduct LCA for the building construction and technical building services components. A 3D city model in CityGMLformat of residential buildings serves as the basis for assessment. The results can be used to identify decisive drivers of energy demands and emissions and the saving potentials of different building development scenarios.

AB Exploiting thermal inertia of buildings as flexibility for the electric grid requires information about thermal dynamics in the system. The presented paper proposes a new method to create digital twins based on smart meter monitoring data and has been applied to 200 Swiss residential buildings. The statistical analysis of these heat pump based heating systems shows expected distributions of key parameters such as heat losses, solar gain factors and thermal capacities. Regional comparisons for crucial building parameters have been carried out and the remote identification of potential renovation candidates has shown promising results.

AB The operation of future wind power plants (WPPs) will rely on maximizing overall profit rather than power production. Factors like current electricity price, grid code compliance, and maintenance costs will affect operational decision. Therefore, it is expected that plant control strategies will trade different control objectives while respecting the industrial practice, where the different levels in the hierarchy may be provided by different equipment vendors. This work proposes a plant controller that aims to track an operator power command at the WPP level and to reject low-frequency loading due to turbulent winds at individual turbines. The plant control respects the hierarchy in which the turbine-level controller takes precedence, interacting only via power set-point commands to each turbine. The control algorithm is based on parallel control loops along with look-up tables and gain scheduling, and its simplicity and effectiveness make it well-suited for industrial applications. Preliminary simulation results with a 32-turbine WPP indicate that there is a significant synergy effect by coordinating operation of the turbines in a plant. Structural loads can be reduced on certain turbines without excessively burdening the others, while an accurate plant-wide power tracking is still provided.

ID RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; GRAPHENE
AB We modified single- and few-layer nano-sized graphene films deposited by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on similar to 300-nm-thick SiO2/Si substrates. The samples were irradiated by a UVC lamp (wavelength of 254 nm) for 15 and 30 minutes in air atmosphere. The light was directed almost parallel (about 2 - 2.5 arcdeg declination angle) to the films' surface. The influence of the modification was evaluated by ellipsometry and X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopies. The results showed that the irradiation caused an increase of the C-O/C-OH bond and a decrease or the complete disappearance of the -C=O/-COOH bond. The structural quality of the graphene films was improved moderately after a 15-min UVC treatment.

AB The aim of this work was to obtain graphene-like phases (defected graphene, graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide) as fine suspensions by applying pulsed laser ablation (PLA) of micro-crystalline graphite suspension in water medium. The fundamental (lambda = 1064 nm), second (lambda = 532 nm), third (lambda = 355 nm) and fourth harmonics (lambda = 266 nm) of a Nd:YAG laser system (15-ns pulse duration and 10-Hz pulse repetition rate) were used. The morphology of the particles was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Their phase composition and structure were explored by Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, grazing incidence X-ray diffractometry (GIXRD) and TEM. The specimens were prepared by drop-casting on a glass substrate (for Raman and GIXRD studies) and on a standard TEM copper mesh for SEM and TEM examination.

AB Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in buildings and wearable technologies for occupants are quickly becoming widespread. These technologies provide copious amounts of high-quality temporal data pertaining to indoor and outdoor environmental quality, comfort, and energy consumption. However, a barrier to their use in many applications is the lack of spatial context in the built environment. Adding Building Information Models (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to these temporal sources unleashes potential. We call this data convergence the Internet-of-Buildings or IoB. In this paper, a digital twin case study of data intersection from various systems is outlined. Initial insights are discussed for an experiment with 17 participants that focused on the collection of occupant subjective feedback to characterize indoor comfort. The results illustrate the ability to capture data from wearables in the context of a BIM data environment.

AB This paper proposes the design of the magnetic circuit to improve stability of the magnetic bearing using HTS. From the rotational characteristic, it is shown that if the flux of the rotor is concentrated to the outer part of the HTS, the rotor will be able to rotate stability. In order to achieve stable rotation, the yoke equipped ring type rotor is proposed. The ring type permanent magnet equipped the yoke is used of this rotor. The change in the flux when the gap between the yoke and the permanent magnet, the yoke thickness and the width are changed is considered. As each value increases, the flux amount increases. As the gap between the yoke and the permanent magnet increases, the flux distribution is more concentrated to the outer part of the HTS. Considering the overall diameter, the boundary where the increasing rate decreases is adopted as the optimum value. In the yoke thickness and the width, the minimum value where the magnetic saturation is not observed is adopted as the optimum value. As a result, the magnetic circuit that the flux is concentrated to the outer part of the HTS is designed. By concentrating the flux to the outer part of the HTS, the stable rotation is given.

AB Kupang is the capital of the Indonesian province of Nusa Tenggara Timur, and has an estimated population in 2019 of 434,972. It is the biggest city and port on the island of Timor. The needs for groundwater is urgent in Kupang. The geology of Kupang is located on the Batu Gamping Koral Formation which composed by coral limestone, which is physically barren and dry. So that local residents often have some problems with water availability. Therefore, needed the information about potential and depth of groundwater aquifers in the area. Measurement of the Wenner configuration 2D resistivity method has been carried out to identify the subsurface to determine the potential for groundwater. Inversion were performed using the method of Least-Square Smoothness Constraint. The result of the interpretation shows that the subsurface resistivity value in the area ranges from 0.4-13.108 Omega m, and groundwater aquifer potential lies at trajectories KPG 01, 02, 03, 04, 14, 15. In the Batu Gamping Koral Formation there is groundwater potential in depth between 0-85 m with a resistivity value of 25.6-205 Omega m, and its constituent rocks are limestone sand and sand. In the Alluvium Formation, the groundwater potential in depth between 0-20 m with resistivity value of 25.6-410 Omega m, and its constituent rock is sand. Whereas in Bobonoro Formation, there is no groundwater potential.

AB This study aimed to explore the teacher's perception of multiple representation in chemistry learning. The research design in this study was descriptive qualitative study. The participant in this study consisted of six chemistry teachers from several senior high schools in Indonesia. The semi-structured interviews were used for data collection. Each sample was asked about their perceptions of multiple representations in chemistry learning process. Data were analyzed by coding which were then grouped into themes. In this study, the researcher find that the teacher has actually applied chemical representations in chemistry learning, but the teacher is not yet familiar with the term of multiple representations in chemistry. Then, representations level that are often applied by teachers in learning chemistry are symbolic and macroscopic representations. Meanwhile, submicroscopic representations are still difficult to apply by teachers in chemistry learning process.

AB In the current study, an excitation laser source emitting at 785 nm (100 mW, CW) was used to obtain ex vivo fluorescence of endogenous melanin in pigmented skin with benign, dysplastic and malignant cutaneous lesions. The samples were obtained after surgical removal during standard excision procedure and split for spectral analysis and histological verification. The samples of benign (BN-5) and dysplastic (DN-3) nevi and of malignant melanoma (MM-7) were used as representative for harmless/harmful cutaneous neoplasia with a similar melanin pigmentation. Emission in the range 800 - 1100 nm was detected and compared using a USB4000 micro-spectrometer (Ocean Optics Inc., USA). The photobleaching dynamics was observed for the emission maxima at 825 nm for 10 minutes with a step of 20 s. These near-IR autofluorescence spectra may be assigned to a single fluorophore if appropriate excitation wavelength is applied, which simplifies the rapid analysis related to the appearance and concentration evaluation of a given type of endogenous fluorophore, as well as allows the evaluation of some parameters, such as photobleaching dynamics, as a diagnostic indicator assessing the tissue state. A diagnostic accuracy of 93.3% was achieved for MM lesions validation when the NIR fluorescence intensity and photobleaching rate values were used to discriminate between nevi and melanoma lesions.

AB A reversible-irreversible transition (RIT) is studied using a periodically-driven vortex system in an amorphous film with random pinning that causes local shear, as a function of shear amplitude d. The relaxation time to reach the steady state exhibits a power-law divergence at a threshold value d(c) with critical exponents in agreement with the values predicted for an absorbing phase transition in the two-dimensional (2D) directed-percolation (DP) universality class. In our previous work, the experiment was conducted at relatively high frequency f, giving rise to a large mean vortex velocity v. Here we use lower f to study the effects of reduced v and increased dynamic pinning on the RIT. The results show that the critical behavior of RIT stays essentially unchanged, while we find a trend for d(c) to increase with decreasing v. We will propose a possible model to qualitatively explain this unexpected result.

AB We have synthesized Fe1+xTe0.6Se0.4 large bulk single crystals by the melting method with a homogenization heat treatment. The relationship between the crystal structures and the superconducting properties was investigated. Critical temperature T-c onset reached the highest value of 14 K for the crystal with x = - 0.005. The maximum critical current densities J(c) in the a-b plane at 4.2 K achieved 1.53 and 0.83 x10(5) A/cm(2) at 0 T and 5 T for the crystal with x = 0, respectively. The crystal lattice and structural parameters were refined by Rietveld analysis. The anion height was estimated by using the obtained parameters. The anion height dependence of T-c and J(c) were investigated. The T-c decreased as the anion height increased, and it showed the same tendency as other Fe-based superconductors. On the other hand J(c) increased initially and then decreased with the increase in the anion height. We believe that it comes from the trade-off between the increase in flux pinning centres of excess Fe sites and the deterioration of superconductivity.

AB We report the fabrication and the transport measurements of FeTe1-xSex (x=0.4, 1) nanobridges along the c axis, toward the appearance of Josephson effects in single-crystal devices. Cross sectional areas of both FeTe0.6Se0.4 and FeSe nanobridges were systematically reduced to 0.06 mu m(2) by using a new method based on the focused ion beam (FIB) techniques. The critical current I-c measured by the current-voltage characteristics is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than that for the conventional microbridges with larger cross sections, while the IcRn product, where R-n is the normal-state resistance along the c axis, is still 3-4 times larger than the theoretical value for the appearance of Josephson effects. We argue the importance of the development of single-crystal Josephson devices and the comparison between FeTe0.6Se0.4 and FeSe nanobridges.

AB The development of efficient methods for non-invasive collection of alveolar lining fluid (ALF) samples containing pulmonary surfactant (PS) components and the study of the surface activity of the obtained native material is relevant for the diagnosis of inflammatory pneumopathies of the lungs. The paper presents an electrostatic aerosol trapping (ESAT) mobile complex for capturing droplets of ALF contained in an exhaled air. Passing the exhaled air through the corona discharge area results in the aerosol droplets charging and their further transferring by electrostatic force into a water surface, where they accumulate forming an adsorbed layer. Additionally, ALF samples were collected using a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The surface properties of the PS obtained by both methods have been examined using the capillary wave method, which was previously modified by the authors specifically for biomedical applications. Significant difference was found in the results obtained with ESAT and BAL in the group of healthy subjects, which can be explained by different origin of the samples obtained by these techniques. Furthermore, significant difference in surface properties was established in the samples collected from healthy volunteers and patient with disseminated tuberculosis, while we did not find significant differences in the limited inflammatory process. The results presented in the paper demonstrate high potential of the proposed non-invasive technique for clinical usage.

AB In this paper, the mixing process of two solutions of inorganic salts in a continuous flow channel with Y-type micromixer is investigated. Due to different diffusivity rates of solutes the double-diffusion convection develops in the channel. To visualize convective flows and the distribution of mixing substances the shear interferometer technique and a fluorescent dye are used. The latter makes it possible to quantify the mixing degree. The mixing extent for different volume flow rates is calculated. The comparison of convection and pure diffusion mechanisms of mixing is provided.

ID SURFACE-TENSION; VISCOSITY
AB In multiphase systems the thermodynamic and rheological properties of the interfacial layer have influences on the overall system behavior. The geometrical properties of capillary waves are extremely useful in the characterization of surfaceparameters. In Shmyrov et al 2019, the modified capillary wave technique was successfully used to perform experiments, to register surface profiles and to realize data processing, yet the algorithm for semi-manual data processing proposed by the authors is labor-intensive and time-consuming. It appears that the analysis of the data is compex because of specific geometry problems, presence of noise at different scales, and data gaps. In this study, the algorithm for analysis of a surface instantaneous profiles formed due to capillary waves propogating is proposed. It was found that the noise and the useful signal have different scales. Moreover, the structure of the useful signal is defined, and therefore it becomes possible to study the noise part of the signal and the patterns of the useful signals. On the basis of the preliminary knowledge about the signal structure, the algorithm has been developed to overcome the above mentioned problems. The proposed method has been tested on the set of semi-synthetic data and provides a reliable result.

ID ARCHITECTURAL TYPOLOGY
AB Climate-resilient buildings in Palestine can play an important role in a more sustainable residential building sector. This paper aims at evaluating the effects of adopting architectural design strategies and material technologies from vernacular architecture to create a new climate-resilient building. The paper targets single houses as these represent the majority of residential buildings in suburban and rural areas, and are similar to the vernacular architecture in size and functionality. The EDSL Tas simulation tool was used to assess the thermal performance and energy savings in the proposed model compared with traditional houses and modern typical houses, in two different climatic zones. The proposed climateresilient house has materials and design strategies derived from vernacular architecture, in addition to the use of thermal insulation. The results show that the proposed house is more climate-resilient compared to modern houses. In cold winter and hot summer climates, the proposed model presents a total annual heating and cooling energy consumption of 59% less than typical modern houses, and 5% more than old buildings. In hot arid summer and warm winter climates, the proposed house presents a total annual heating and cooling energy consumption of 58% less than a modern typical house and 8% more than the traditional house.

AB Using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for classification of the existing residential neighbourhoods and their spatial characteristics (e.g. density) so as to provide plausible scenarios for designing future sustainable housing is a novel application. Here we develop a methodology using a Random Forests algorithm (in combination with GIS spatial data processing) to detect and classify the residential neighbourhoods and their spatial characteristics within the region between Oxford and Cambridge, that is, the 'Oxford-Cambridge Arc'. The classification model is based on four pre-defined urban classes, that is, Centre, Urban, Suburban, and Rural for the entire region. The resolution is a grid of 500 m x 500 m. The features for classification include (1) dwelling geometric attributes (e.g. garden size, building footprint area, building perimeter), (2) street networks (e.g. street length, street density, street connectivity), (3) dwelling density (number of housing units per hectare), (4) building residential types (detached, semi-detached, terraced, and flats), and (5) characteristics of the surrounding neighbourhoods. The classification results, with overall average accuracy of 80% (accuracy per class: Centre: 38%, Urban 91%, Suburban 83%, and Rural 77%), for the Arc region show that the most important variables were three characteristics of the surrounding area: residential footprint area, dwelling density, and number of private gardens. The results of the classification are used to establish a baseline for the current status of the residential neighbourhoods in the Arc region. The results bring data-driven decision-making processes to the level of local authority and policy makers in order to support sustainable housing development at the regional scale.

AB Technological developments are currently entering the industrial revolution 4.0 where everything is digital based. Learning media are tools used by educators in carrying out learning activities. One of the learning media that can be applied in learning mathematics is GeoGebra software. However, the GeoGebra software does not interact between educators and students, so we need a Google Classroom to improve interactive learning that can be combined with GeoGebra Online. The process of developing interactive online learning media using Google Classroom were assisted by GeoGebra software on quadratic function material used the Thiagarajan development model which consisted of four stages, namely define, design, development and dissemination. The results of learning media validation fulfilled the validity criteria with a correlation coefficient based on the validation sheet of 0.92 which is included in the valid category with a very high interpretation. Practical criteria with a percentage of the average value of the user response questionnaire based on a user response questionnaire of 91.75% which is included in the practical category with a good percentage. The effectiveness criteria with the percentage of learning outcomes based on the learning outcomes test was 82.61% which is included in the effective category with a very good percentage. The development of instnictional media tested at SMA Muhammadiyah 3 Jember has fulfilled three criteria, namely valid, practical and effective.

AB With the fourth generation of district heating networks in sight, opportunities are rising for better services and optimized planning of energy production. Indeed, the more intensive data collection is expected to allow for load prediction, customer profiling, etc. In this context, our work aims at a better understanding of customer profiles from the captured data.
   Given the variety of households, such profiles are difficult to capture. This study explores the possibility to predict domestic hot water (DHW) usage. Such prediction is made challenging due to the presence of two components in the signal, the first one bound to the physical properties of the DHW distribution system, the second one bound to the human patterns related to DHW consumption.
   Our contributions include (1) the analysis of recurrent neural network architectures based on GRU, (2) the inclusion of state-based labels inferred in an unsupervised way to simulate domain knowledge, (3) the comparison of different features.
   Results show that the physical contribution in the signal can be forecasted successfully across households. On the contrary, the stochastic "human" component is harder to predict and would need further research, either by improving the modelling or by including alternate signals.

AB Smart building and smart city specialists agree that complex, innovative use cases, especially those using cross-domain and multi-source data, need to make use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, today's AI mainly concerns machine learning and artificial neural networks (deep learning), whereas the first forty years of the discipline (the last decades of the 20th century) were essentially focused on a knowledge-based approach, which is still relevant today for some tasks. In this article we advocate a merging of these two AI trends - an approach known as neuro-symbolic AI - for the smart city, and point the way towards a complete integration of the two technologies, compatible with standard software.

AB Self-sufficiency (SS) of buildings with low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be obtained using photovoltaics (PV). To maximize self-consumption - minimizing the import of grid electricity - PV can be coupled with a hydrogen storage system converting the electricity to hydrogen by electrolysis during the summer season, when the on-site production is higher, and using it during the winter season with fuel cells. This article deals with the sizing constraints of solar hydrogen systems at building-scale. The future building for the Smart Living Lab (SLL) in Fribourg (Switzerland) has been taken as case study. It has four stories and a mixed usage (Office-building and Research facilities), with a multi-oriented PV installation in order to produce enough electricity to achieve at least 50% of self-sufficiency. Using the PV production, this study aims to optimise the sizing of a hydrogen storage system allowing to reach the required self-sufficiency ratio. Finally, a comparison of the global efficiency of the system for three different demand-side scenarios.

AB The study aims to analyze junior high school students' scientific literacy in Natural Science subjects. The study used a case study method. There were 70 students of IX grade in a private junior high school in West Bandung Regency. Respondents consisted of 40 boys and 30 girls with an average age of 15 years old. The instrument used was a written test consisting of 30 simple multiple-choice questions for three aspects of scientific literacy, which were scientific knowledge, scientific competencies, and attitudes toward science. The data analysis used Rasch Analysis Model (RAM) and assisted by Winsteps 4.4.5. The results being discussed are the person and item reliability, variable maps, and differential item functioning (DIF). The results show that the average scientific literacy ability of students falls into the low category, and some questions have gender biases. Thus, scientific literacy needs to be promoted and involved effectively in teaching-learning activities to get students used to the scientific literacy environment in their learning programs during school years.

AB Teacher professional development is inseparable from the process of increasing teacher competency that can be trained through training activities. Training held to improve the pedagogic and professional competence of physics teachers both by the training organizers and the deliberation of subject teachers is generally still conducted face-to-face, even though the teacher has limited time and place in following it. This happens because the teacher also has to carry out his main task of teaching, so we need a training strategy that can be accessed by teachers anywhere and anytime. The purpose of this study is to find out the reasons why in the process of developing pedagogic and professional teachers need learning strategies that are based on hybrid learning. This research method is descriptive qualitative using data collection techniques in the form of interviews, documentation studies, and questionnaires for teacher needs in the implementation of training. The results obtained based on interviews with the training providers showed that the implementation of the pedagogical and professional teacher improvement training was still conducted face-to-face. Meanwhile, the results of the questionnaire distributed to 45 physics teachers showed that most of the teachers stated that they needed training to improve pedagogic and professional competencies, which facilitated the teacher's training in the form of combining face-to-face and online. This can be done by implementing a hybrid learning training strategy, because in hybrid learning we can combine face-to-face and online training.

AB Green chemistry is one of efforts to minimize the dangerous during preparation, reaction and the product of its reaction in daily life, then the application of green chemistry will be important especially among chemistry students. This study aims at analysing students' attitude towards green chemistry and its application in everyday life. Questionnaires distributed to 190 respondents. The questionnaires gathered information on students' opinion on green chemistry and its application in everyday life. The result indicated that most of students agree with the application of green chemistry principles, but on several principles it is known that some respondents still think it is impossible or do not want to apply it in chemistry experiments or everyday life. It can be implied that lecturers should be pay attention more to some emphasis if they want to introduce the application of green chemistry principles in teaching and learning activities

AB In this study we prepared YxYb1-xBa2Cu3O7-delta (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) powders and bulks to use as intermedium for superconducting joint between REBCO-coated conductors. Superconducting joints are essential in the development of high-field REBCO persistent magnets. All the powders and bulks were sintered at 850 degrees C for 10 hours in air. Bulks were prepared by pressing at 70 MPa. Calcination of the bulks was performed under the same conditions as the powders. Two joint samples between GdBa2Cu3O7-delta-coated conductors were prepared by using the bulk samples. For x=0.1, a superconducting joint was successfully obtained.

AB This result of research on Trend In Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) scores of Indonesian students in 2011 puts it at the bottom. And until now there are still many references of mathematics students and mathematics researchers in Indonesia. However, there are no results of research on the position where students in the city of Cirebon currently in the TIMSS score. The method of the reasearch is survey method by taking a random sample of 491 students taken from eighth-grade students of public and private schools showed the average TIMSS score of students who answered correctly from the sample tested reached 58% with a standard deviation of 8. The average of student correct answer in Cirebon higher than national average or international average correct answer in all level at TIMSS in 2011, thus low level, intermediate level, high level and advance level. However, the mathematical ability of students in the city of Cirebon still needs to be improved because in intermediate level, high level, and advance level still less satisfactory. In gender differences perspective, mathematical ability female student better than mathematical ability of male students for all level at TIMSS in 2011.

AB Critical- and creative-thinking skills are important competencies students must have to encounter the challenges of the 21st century. The development of teaching materials that emphasize critical- and creative-thinking skills is very necessary for students to improve these skills. This research aims to analyze three middle school science books based on critical- and creative-thinking skills on environmental pollution material. The research procedure consisted of developing an instrument for assessing critical- and creative-thinking skills, validating the indicators of the instruments using expert judgment, and conducting an assessment of middle school science book. The development of critical-thinking skill indicators refers to Facione while the indicators-of creatives thinking skills refer to Torrance. The results of the analyses show- that the average critical-thinking skill indicator achievement for the environmental pollution material on interpretation is 2.83%, analysis 2.75%, conclusion 3.16%, evaluation 2.83%, explanation 2.91%, and self-regulation 2.33%. The achievement of creative-thinking skill indicators on average is 2.66% for fluency, 2.66% for flexibility, 2.41% for originality, and 2.75% for elaboration. Students have low critical- and creative-thinking skills on the air pollution and pollution sub-materials.

AB Online trading arithmetic is a new learning that is used to improve students' creative thinking skills in solving mathematics higher order thinking skills problems. Besides, it can also improve students' entrepreneurship skills. The learning process online trading arithmetic uses several market place applications such as Shopee, Bukalapak, and Tokopedia in which many online sellers offering the same item at different price. In addition, there are many possibilities to change the price of an item so students are interested in getting the best price for maximum profit. This research aimed to determine the differences of students' level of creative thinking in solving mathematics Higher Arithmetic Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) problems after the learning of online trading arithmetic. This research employed a descriptive method with a qualitative approach The research subjects were junior high school students consisting of 20 students which was divided into two groups; the control and experimental groups. The control group received regular arithmetic learning (control class) while the experimental group received online trading arithmetic (experimental class). The results of this research indicated that: (1) the level of students' creative thinking skills in solving mathematics HOTS questions in the experimental group showed the majority of students are in the creative category, while in the control group was less creative; (2) the metacognitive level of the majority of students at MTs Miftahul Huda Muncar Banyuwangi was at level 3 (aware use) for the experimental group while it was at level 2 (aware use) for the control group; (2) the result of statistical analysis showed the significance value of Sig. (2-tailed) was 0.00 < 0.05; it can be concluded that the implementation of online trading arithmetic learning had a significant effect on students' creative thinking skills; moreover, (3) there was an effect of the students' metacognition level on their creative thinking abilities, which indicated that the higher the students' metacognition level, the higher their creative thinking level.

AB We examine digital behavior of faults caused by a change of the order of the pulse arrivals in Rapid Single-Flux-Quantum (RSFQ) logic circuits. Based on the timing fault model, we present a flow of automatic test pattern generation for testing digital RSFQ chips. As the test pattern generation repeatedly executes fault simulation, the scalability depends on computational cost of the simulation. We propose an efficient fault simulation method based on two ideas. First, we share computation for the fault-free circuit and faulty circuits as much as possible. Secondly, we exploit the pipelined behavior of RSFQ logic circuits to suppress computation for unnecessary signals. We have implemented our simulation method and obtained evaluation results to show that our method is effective for large circuits.

This paper wants to uncover various thoughts about efforts to introduce physics to early childhood. The method used is a Focus Group Discussion (FGD), which involves experts from physics education, linguists, management, and early education. There are several important points that became the result of the FGD, including (1) physics logic must be made simpler that is easy to understand (2) Mathematical formula which becomes a symbol language does not need to be introduced first. Language skills are needed to understand physics and communicate it (3) Through the right approach, method and media, learning that is delivered by the teacher will make early childhood more literate with physics. This research concludes that physics is possible to be taught in early childhood. We, therefore, recommend that early childhood teachers collaborate with physics teachers in planning, implementing, and evaluating physics learning.

AB This paper addresses the limitations of existing Solar Envelope (SE) methods to explore the trade-offs of solar radiation and urban shading, and to simultaneously account for several different Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). It offers an alternative parametric workflow - the Solar Block Generator (SBG) - which is based on an additive voxelization method by which multiple solar-driven massing alternatives are generated and evaluated for a given site, corresponding to a set of user-defined environmental KPIs. This method is tested here on an urban redevelopment case study in the Mediterranean (Tel Aviv). The results help achieve a more holistic approach for solar driven urban design.

ID NANOPARTICLES; DEPOSITION
AB This work presents results of applying a method based on pulses laser co-deposition of a noble metal and a magnetic iron oxide for fabrication of ordered composite nanostructures. The experimental scheme includes two nanosecond laser beams with a wavelength of 1064 nm that ablate simultaneously two targets - Au and Fe2O3. The process is implemented in air - a condition that leads to a fast condensation of the ablated material into nanoparticles. By choosing different positioning of the ablation plumes and the substrate, composites of iron oxide nanoparticles decorated by noble metal ones can be fabricated. An external magnetic field applied close to the substrate orients and aligns the nanoparticles into chains. The effects of the processing parameters that define the geometry of the experiment are studied and presented. The method can be optimized for fabrication of complex composite nanostructures with applications in sensorics, optics and magneto-optics.

ID AIR-GAP
AB We demonstrate that interference wedge structures suitably composed of wedged purely glass elements using Fresnel reflection only can be effectively employed for realization of competitive light beam splitters and filters (especially for high-power laser beams). The theoretical analysis, simulation and experimental testing show that for appropriately chosen parameters and for a suitably composed interference complex such structures can achieve a controlled variable transmission in a wide range (99% - similar to 30%) and reflection from similar to 2% to similar to 70%. The traditional realization of purely glass splitters ensures no more than similar to 20% reflectivity. The splitters proposed are very compact sheet-like elements (e.g., 5x3x0.2 cm) and the splitting is implemented by sliding in the splitter's plane. Thus, the propagation direction of the formed beams is preserved. The incident beam on the purely glass splitter (no dielectric or metallic mirrors) can be of high power and the influence of the air humidity is strongly reduced; also, cleaning the filter surfaces presents no difficulties. A single splitter can work in a wide range of wavelengths (IR, visible) without polarization dependence for incident angles up to similar to 20 degrees.

ID OPTICAL PULSES
AB The nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NSE) is well-known and is one of the most commonly used in the field of nonlinear optics. Pulses with picosecond and femtosecond duration are very well described by the NSE, but it does not work for attosecond and phase-modulated femtosecond laser pulses, where the spectral width of the pulse is of the order of the carrying frequency. In such cases, it is more convenient to use the general nonlinear amplitude equation (NAE). During the propagation of ultra-short pulses in optical fibers, the effects of the third-order linear dispersion and dispersion of nonlinearity become significant and have to be taken into account. We expanded the NAE by including these two effects. In this paper, we present an analytical study on the influence of third-order linear dispersion and dispersion of nonlinearity on the evolution of ultra-short optical pulses and on the possibility of dark soliton formation under such conditions in a medium with normal dispersion.

AB A time-domain filter is presented in this paper for the noise reduction of the camera images, then elaborated for the full-field 3D-DIC vibration analysis of mechanical components. The basic idea behind this filtering is to initially decompose the light signal of each pixel of the raw images, both for the left and the right cameras, with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The signal is then reconstructed with the Inverse FFT by keeping the zero-order harmonic and the first harmonic and just discarding all the others, which only introduce noise contributions. The down-sampling approach is also used in combination with this filtering to reach high loading frequencies, even without (expensive) high-speed cameras, provided that a quite short exposure time is available. A cantilever aluminum plate was tested at 591 Hz, and a similar experiment was repeated on a bladed disk (or blisk) excited at high frequency, 6458 Hz, obtaining clear and smooth displacement maps even in the range of 10 microns. In the blisk application, a single blade with a significantly larger displacement amplitude was clearly observed, which could be interpreted as mistuning evidence.

ID MODEL
AB As wind turbines are usually clustered in wind farms, knowledge of the evolution of the wind turbine wakes is important because downstream turbines will be exposed to them, causing higher loads and maintenance times. For that reason, wind turbine wakes have been studied intensively and different engineering wake models were derived. However, none of them is constructed from a few basic and robust assumptions, while such a formalism already exists for the axisymmetric turbulent wake. Therefore, we will apply these models to data obtained in a wind farm using a scanning LiDAR. The wakes of two wind turbines are analyzed in four different wind directions chosen so that their wakes will have different degrees of interaction. The axisymmetric wake models are found to perform better than the Jensen wake model, and the main source of improvement is shown to be the presence of a virtual origin. Indeed, a virtual origin is shown to also improve the Jensen wake model significantly. Overall, our results indicate that a view from classical axisymmetric wake theory can help to improve the understanding of the evolution of wind turbine wakes in the atmospheric boundary layer.

AB It is necessary to achieve high fatigue strength in order to apply carbon reinforced fiber plastics (CRFP) for critical elements subjected to vibration. Gradual accumulation of fatigue damage is accompanied by changes in the material stiffness and natural frequencies. The purpose of this work is to found experimental data on the change of the elastic characteristics of layered CRFP as fatigue damage accumulates. The object of the study is standard samples made of unidirectional carbon/epoxy fiber with different layering schemes. The samples were subjected to fatigue tests under cyclic tension with constant amplitude. The test of each sample was stopped several times at different loading stages to execute experimental modal analysis and non-destructive inspection of the appeared defects. The found natural frequencies were used to solve the inverse problem of identifying the elastic parameters of the laminate monolayer: two Young's modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio. As a result, the dependences of these parameters on the relative fatigue life were obtained. These dependences, together with the results of non-destructive testing, can be used to describe the process of fatigue damage accumulation and for the subsequent development of methods for the fatigue life prediction.

ID FATIGUE
AB Modern VHCF testing regimes are studied. A new loading scheme applicable to a piezoelectric fatigue testing machine is proposed. The scheme is studied analytically and numerically. The analytical part comprises the calculation of the specimen's geometry to operate correctly on the VHCF testing machine, as well as the specimen's stress-strain state calculation during an experiment in order to determine the one's durability. A model based on a kinetic damage equation is introduced. This model is used in the numerical experiment. The behavior of a finite-element specimen in a fatigue experiment is calculated from the beginning up to the stage of active crack growth.

ID HIGH-CYCLE-FATIGUE
AB The problem of cyclic loading under pure torsion is an important problem for numerous different industrial applications, such as shafts, springs, blades, and others. The loading conditions for aircraft, railway, automobile industries are often corresponding to long fatigue life. The rough estimation shows that the number of cycles for springs in car engine is exceeds 10(8) cycle while blades for aircraft turbine may undergo more than 10(10) loading cycles. Such, to provide a safety in service life for such elements a multiaxial fatigue failure criterion is needed to predict damage zone location and fatigue life. This paper is aimed to introduce the multi regime approach to predict fatigue damage zone evaluation and number of cycles to crack initiation and total fatigue life. The presented approach is based on damage theory supplemented by multiaxial failure criterion. The proposed model includes the algorithm for automatic determination the fatigue loading range (low-, high- or very-high cycle fatigue) and allows different crack opening modes. To show how to apply the proposed approach and verify the results of calculation the series of numerical simulation on hourglass specimen subjected to VHCF pure torsion is performed. The results of numerical simulation are compared to VHCF torsion tests.

AB A two-criterion kinetic damage model is proposed to describe the development of the fatigue fracture process under cyclic loading. On this basis, a procedure is proposed for calculating the coefficients of the kinetic equation for various modes of fatigue fracture from low-cycle to very-high-cycle fatigue. A uniform numerical method has been developed based on an implicit approximation of the differential equation for damage. This method makes it possible to carry out an end-to-end calculation of the evolution of crack-like zones of fatigue fracture in the material without considering cracks in their classical sense, as well as to estimate the durability of samples from the first nucleation to macrofracture. Calculations were made of the fatigue fracture of specimens under long-term cyclic loading according to the three-point bending scheme with the development of crack-like fracture zones in the modes from HCF to VHCF. Comparison of numerical and experimental results for specimens of titanium alloys is carried out.

AB We present a study on nanosecond laser ablation of thin composite films immersed in liquids. The composite films are obtained using a classical on-axis pulsed laser deposition technology, where the target consists of two sectors with different composition. Multicomponent films containing ZnO, TiO2, and Ag, are thus deposited on a substrate. The as-prepared composite films are then immersed in double distiled water and irradiated by nanosecond laser pulses. This results in the production of colloids composed by multicomponent nanoparticles. The optical properties of the colloids are evaluated by optical transmittance measurements in the UV-VIS spectral range. Transmission electron microscopy is used to visualize the nanostructures formed in the solution, as well as to evaluate their size distribution. The phase composition of the samples is determined by selected area electron diffraction.

AB The Parallelized Large-Eddy Model (PALM) and the Simulator for Wind Farm Applications (SOWFA) have been used to simulate the marine boundary layer flows under neutral stability condition. The present work aims to investigate the capability of the two models in reproducing the structure of turbulence in the offshore environment through comparative analysis with a focus on wind spectra and coherence. Wind spectra obtained from the two LES solvers agree well with the empirical spectral model near the surface but show lower turbulence intensity in the low frequency range above the surface layer. Both models also produce highly consistent estimates of coherence with different horizontal and vertical separations, which match well with Davenport and IEC coherence models at height of 180m and 140m respectively. As the height decreases, LES predicts lower vertical coherence compared with the IEC model and the fitted decay coefficient for Davenport model grows as the separation distance increases.

AB We report NMR experiments on heavily electron-doped Fe-based superconductor in comparison with the results on the parent Fe-based compounds. The typical parent Fe-based compound LaFe(As1-x'Px')O exhibits the re-emergent antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at x' similar to 0.6 (AFM2) separated from the parent AFM order at x' = 0 (AFM1). Systematic P-31-NMR study on [Sr4Sc2O6]Fe-2(As1-xPx)(2) (SrSc42622), which has local lattice parameters of iron-pnictogen (FePn) layer similar to the series of LaFe(As1-x'Px')O, also revealed that the presence of AFM1 order is universal for most of parent Fe-based compounds. In contrast, the static AFM2 order was absent in this series, however, the dynamical low-energy AFM spin fluctuations are enhanced at around x similar to 0.8, indicating that the onset of the static AFM2 is quite sensitive to the local lattice parameters of FePn layer. In order to elucidate the further universality and diversity, we have carried out Se-77-NMR measurement on Li-x(NH3)(y)Fe2-delta Se2 (T-c = 44 K) in heavily electron-doped regime. Although the spin fluctuations at low energies does not significantly develops upon cooling, the moderate spin fluctuations were extracted at high temperatures from comparison of the temperature (T) dependences of Knight shift and nuclear relaxation rate (1/T1T). We discuss the universality and diversity of the relationship between the T-c and the characteristics of the spin fluctuations in the Fe-based compounds from a microscopic point of the NMR measurements.

AB E-module reaction rate based guided inquiry has been developed using the Kvisoft flipbook maker. The e-module is developed using the Plomp development model which consists of three phases namely, the initial investigation phase, the prototype making phase, and the assessment phase. The results of the material validation obtained an average percentage for the content aspects, presentation aspects, language aspects, and graphics aspects are 87.46%, 86.63%, 95.80%, and 81.5% with a very valid category. While the result of media validation obtained an average percentage for the cover design aspect, the content design aspect and the display aspect are 100%, 97.80%, and 85.6% with a very valid category. The result of the user response test obtained average percentages are 88.34% and 86.25% with a very good category. Based on the result of the validation and user response test can be concluded that the e-module reaction rate based guided inquiry is feasible to be used in the chemistry learning process as independent teaching material.

AB The historical site of the Great St Bernard Pass, situated in the Alps at an elevation of 2469 m, records very high electricity consumptions. This study aims at evaluating the photovoltaic potential at the pass. The analysis was performed on the envelope surfaces of the building complex, taking into account the topography as well as typical climate data issued from a weather station located on site. It is found that during the months from June to October, each year, 54 MWh of electricity could potentially be generated, which is more than what could be produced by the same system in the climate of Geneva.

AB Education to realize Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is known as Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). Teachers with adequate TPACK competencies integrated ESD is one of the keys to realizing ESD. The purpose of this paper is to reveal the professional knowledge of prospective biology teachers in the form TPACK-ESD, in designing learning plans before and after got ESD briefing. TPACK-ESD assessed from Cores and RPP integrated ESD. Eight prospective teachers in the third year who were taking the capita selecta biology course were used as the research sample, chosen by convenience sampling. Descriptive research was used to study TPACK-ESD prospective teachers by collected data consist of CoRes and RPP about viruses and biotechnology. Scoring results of CoRes and RPP that analyzed through descriptive statistics, showed that TPACK-ESD prospective teachers tended to increase after the ESD briefing for both contents. For each component of TPACK, the results showed that content knowledge (CK) illustrating knowledge integrated ESD compared before ESD briefing. Pedagogical knowledge (PK) has shown a learning design that can facilitate students to be able to develop ESD competencies compared before ESD briefing. On the other hand, Technological knowledge (TK) prospective teachers did not seem to increase after ESD briefing.

AB This study aims to determine the extent of the role of the ability of abstraction to strengthen students early knowledge in learning mathematics. This type of research is a literature study. The type of data used is secondary data from articles related to the study. Data collection methods are by reading the appropriate arithmetic study, then classified more specifically. Next identify the role of the ability of abstraction to strengthen students early knowledge in learning mathematics. From the results of identification then analyzed through the process of categorizing and classifying. The final step is to describe the results of the literature review and conclude it. The results of this paper indicate that the ability of abstraction is very important because it is closely related to the inculcation of basic mathematical concepts that are used as early knowledge or prerequisites of studentss in learning new material in mathematics learning and studentss can demonstrate their mathematical ideas, make connections between concepts and can manipulate objects that are abstract.

The STEM project in learning-by combining science, technology, engineering and mathematics-becomes collaborative in order to overcome problems that often arise in the world of education, especially at the college level that produces teachers generally in schools. Prospective teacher students often experience difficulties in making papers that include STEM components in them. The purpose of this study is to analyze STEM learning that enables students to make better products than other students who obtain regular learning. This study was designed as a quasi-experimental study. The research design was a static group comparison involving at least two groups. The product of STEM results were taken from the students of Biology Education of 2019-2020 Class A consisting of 21 students and Class B consisting of 21 students. Prospective teacher students often experience difficulties in making papers that include STEM components in them The data analysis used was the product data analysis. Each of the descriptive statistics was analyzed, then inferential statistics were analyzed to see the significance of each class. The conclusion obtained is the ability of students who get STEM learning in writing papers is better than students who get regular learning

AB This research is a descriptive study that aims to describe the role of the solution plan as a scaffolding that helps students to solve mathematical modeling tasks. The subjects in this study were 32 students of grade VIII of Junior High School number 3 Ngaglik. Data collecting using observations and documents. The data collected in this study is in the form of field notes and students' worksheets. During the learning process, students are given a worksheet about modeling mathematics and equipped with a solution plan, and then the researcher makes observations. The study results found that the solution plan can be used as a scaffolding to support students solve mathematical modeling problems, where the solution plan consists of four stages: understanding tasks, searching mathematics, using mathematics, and explaining results. The solution plan facilitates connecting students' imagination with the context of the problem and connecting prior knowledge needed to solve mathematical modeling problems through questions or statements that do not directly lead to answers.

AB This study compares a wind field recommended by the wind turbine design standards to more realistic wind fields based on measurements. The widely used Mann spectral tensor model with inputs recommended by the standard, is compared to FitMann, the Mann model with inputs fitted to measurements and TIMESR; using measured time series combined with the Davenport coherence model. The Mann model produces too low energy levels at the lowest frequencies of the wind spectra, while the wind spectra generated by FitMann approaches the measured values. TIMESR reproduces the measured spectral values at all frequencies. The different models give similar vertical coherence, while the Mann and FitMann models give lower horizontal coherence than TIMESR. Investigating the wind loads on a bottom-fixed 10-MW wind turbine, the spectra for the tower bottom fore-aft and blade root flapwise bending moment follow the shape of the wind spectra closely at low frequencies. The low-frequency range is important for the blade root and in particular the tower bottom bending moment. Thus, the TIMESR model, followed by FitMann, is assumed to give the most accurate fatigue estimates. For the specific situation analysed in this study, the FitMann model gives only 18 and 5 % lower estimates than TIMESR of the tower bottom and blade root damage equivalent bending moments, while the Mann model gives 27 % and 12 % lower estimates. The tower top yaw and fore-aft bending moments depend on the wind coherence. For the specific situation analysed in this study, the FitMann model gives 9 and 5 % higher estimates of the tower top yaw and tower top damage equivalent (bending) moments compared to TIMESR, while the Mann model gives 23 % and 18 % higher estimates. Since only measurements of the vertical coherence are available, it is not clear which model is superior for the tower top moments. However, the importance of a proper coherence model is documented.

AB Prestressed concrete floaters are gaining growing interest for floating wind turbines, while different material properties can affect the characteristics of floater motions and the range of suitable floater geometries. In this study, a basic geometry of a semi-submersible floater for 10MW is designed, based on which sensitivity study of the material property on floater design is conducted. It was found that minimum floater pitch angles achieved by selecting the optimum floater geometries were similar for the three types of material, while larger values of geometrical variables were required for concrete floaters than for steel floaters for a floater pitch limitation If larger wall thickness was to be required for concrete structures due to, for example, corrosion protection and crack limitation, generally larger side column width and lower hull length were required for concrete floaters. As the sensitivity of pitch angle to the wall thickness was more affected by wind excitation than wave excitation for normal concrete, it is indicated that the design space for the length of hull can be widened by combining the design with the wind turbine controller methods in the treatment of the maximum thrust force. Lightweight concrete had advantages over normal concrete in the lower center of gravity. The raw material cost of lightweight concrete was higher than normal concrete but significantly lower than steel floaters.

AB The operation of the RF SQUID is restricted by the condition that the inductance parameter beta(L) must be in the range of 1-3. However, since both ends of the Josephson junction (JJ) of RF-SQUID are shorted, it is difficult to non-destructively estimate the critical current (I-C). Thus, we proposed a technique for the non-destructive measurement of the I-C of a high-temperature superconducting (HTS) RF-SQUID ring by evaluating the behaviour of the flux in superconducting thin films using a SQUID magnetometer. A superconducting ring sample with JJ was placed below the HTS SQUID magnetometer and cooled down to 77 K. The change in the SQUID output was monitored on application of the magnetic field. When increasing the field, the waveforms indicated that the screening current of the ring sample exceeded the I-C of the JJ, and the JJ became a normal-conducting state. As a result, we estimated the I-C of the JJ of this sample a s 134 mu A using the values of mutual inductance and the coupling coefficient alpha between the coil and the sample.

AB MgB2 superconducting bulk materials are characterized as simple and uniform metallic compounds, and capable of trapping field of non-distorted conical shapes. Although pulsed-field magnetization technique (PFM) is expected to be a cheap and an easy way to activate them, the heat generation due to the magnetic flux motion causes serious degradation of captured fields. The authors precisely estimated the flux trapping property of the bulk samples, found that the flux-shielding effect closely attributed to the sample dimensions. The magnetic field capturing of Ti-5.0wt% sample reached the highest value of 0.76 T. The applied field which reached the centre of the sample surface shifted from 1.0 T to 1.2 T with increasing sample thickness from 3.67 mm to 5.80 mm. This means that the shielding effect was enhanced with increasing the sample thickness. Moreover, Ti-addition affected the frequency of flux jump happenings. The occurrence of flux jumps was suppressed in 5.0wt%Ti-added sample. This means that the heat capacity of the compounds was promoted by Ti addition.

AB In this work, we propose the finite-element-based mathematical model of the metal-inducer system. This system consists of a coil with put-on C-shaped ferromagnets. We study how the measurands of the inducer, such as the coil voltage and the uncompensated force acting on metal, depend on the system parameters. We variate the geometry of the system to estimate the boundary effect impact. Also, we study how the coil voltage depends on the ferromagnets' spacing and their number. The inhomogeneity of electric conductivity is modeled via holes in the metal volume. To estimate their impact, we defined the dependences of the measurands on the number and the size of inhomogeneities.

AB High-temperature superconductivity (HTS) has the potential to be a useful technology for space applications, allowing for high current densities and magnetic field generation in compact devices. However, HTS requires cryogenic temperatures and it is not well understood how this can best be achieved in a space environment. Using a modelling approach, the expected heat load on a hypothetical 3U CubeSat with an HTS coil during a sun-synchronous low Earth orbit was predicted. The direction and magnitude of solar, albedo and infrared incident radiation toward the satellite was calculated for each orbital position of a circular 732 km, Omega = 0 degrees longitude of ascending node orbit. Using a finite element approach, the surface radiosity and temperature of the CubeSat was predicted and validated. Finally, the instantaneous heat load on the HTS magnet, which generates a 1T magnetic field, was calculated as a function of orbital position. This study provides technical information about the characteristics of the refrigeration device required to maintain cryogenic temperatures for an HTS coil on a space faring vessel, such as a portable cryocooler. Selection and design of a satellite cooling system must be optimised according to the calculated heat load and available solar power.

AB This article presents the results of a simulation of conjugate heat transfer between cold air and warm shaft lining during airflow reverse at a hard rock mine. A comparison of the numerical results with collected experimental data was carried out. A significant discrepancy between the two was revealed, indicating that not all heat sources and additional air heating mechanisms were taken into account in the simulation. Possible reasons for the discrepancy are discussed and the most probable reasons are identified for further study. A quantitative assessment of the possible factors considered is carried out. Further tasks for research are determined.

AB The article is devoted to the study of the mechanical response of an electro-viscoelastic structure if an electric voltage with given characteristics supplied to a piezoelectric element attached to the surface of the structure. A cantilever plate made of a viscoelastic material is considered as a structure under study. The amplitude of displacements of the free end of the plate in resonance modes occurring at forced steady-state vibrations is considered as the mechanical response. Excitation of vibrations is realized by a harmonic movement applied to the clamped end of the plate. The control of the mechanical response within the framework of this work is supposed to be performed by supplying an electric signal to the piezoelectric element. This signal changes harmonically and has the form of a potential difference which changes according to a harmonic law. The magnitude of the vibration amplitude of the structure is determined numerically by the finite element method implemented in the ANSYS software package. The viscoelastic properties of the plate material are described according to the relations of hereditary theory of viscoelasticity in terms of complex dynamic moduli. Within the framework of this work, the relations between the mechanical response of the structure and the magnitude and polarity of the electric voltage applied to the piezoelectric element were obtained. It is shown that by a proper selection of the characteristics of the electric voltage, it is possible to control the magnitude of the amplitude of forced steady-state vibrations.

AB A systematic search of scientific literature on the topic of Design for Disassembly (DfD) in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry was performed with a special focus on study cases. The results were augmented by electronic magazine search due to the non-representative amount of data found in the scientific database. Results show the domination of wood and steel solutions among architects and engineers designing for disassembly. Frame structural system is preferable. DfD structures are mainly located in Europe but observed in the whole world and growing exponentially since 90'. The database with 117 built DfD study cases is made available online and will be further developed.

AB The impact on the molten metal with electromagnetic forces makes it possible to create specific flows in the metal, which, in turn, are able to concentrate particles of inclusions in a given area, from where they can be removed mechanically. In this case, it is important to determine the shape of the inclusions, which will provide the best efficiency of impact on them with electromagnetic forces. The use of such an effect is possible in the process of crystallization (transfer of partially crystallized small regions of the metal), as well as during the separation of impurities from liquid metals using electromagnetic forces.
   The work is devoted to a numerical study of the features of the effect of electromagnetic forces on inclusions (in shape that differs from spherical) in an electrically conductive medium.

AB The current study presents the CO2-eq emissions of the operational energy use of a single-family house, equipped with a micro-cogeneration unit. A back-up boiler and electricity from the grid cover the remaining energy demand, not covered by the micro-CHP. Two different technologies are evaluated, i.e. ICE and fuel cell systems, operating with a variable share of biomethane, while two different substrates were considered for the biomethane generation. A dynamic LCA was applied for the electricity mix, coming from the grid, using different time steps. The results show that producing biomethane from biowaste compared to conventional natural gas is beneficial, in terms of CO2-eq emissions, independently of the micro-CHP technology, while the total CO2-eq emissions of the fuel cell technology are higher than those of the ICE, independently of the substrate and the biomethane share.

AB A quantitative study aims to investigate preservice teacher's beliefs in mathematics and mathematics teaching and learning. The participants were 103 preservice mathematics teachers who were studying at the Musamus University of Merauke. The TBTP questionnaire was used to measure the beliefs of preservice teachers. The results showed that there were differences in the beliefs of preservice teachers when teaching in classes dominated by high ability students and low ability students. Preservice teachers tend to have platonist beliefs when teaching in high ability classes and when teaching in low ability classes preservice teachers have instrumentalist beliefs. Most preservice teachers have instrumentalist beliefs in mathematics. The implications of the study provide recommendations for teacher educators to change the beliefs of preservice mathematics teachers into problem-solving views.

ID TISSUE
AB Boiling histotripsy is a promising noninvasive ultrasonic technique that can be used to mechanically destroy solid tumours. In boiling histotripsy, the formations and dynamics of a boiling vapour bubble and cavitation clouds contribute towards mechanical tissue fractionation. Whilst a number of numerical and experimental studies have been performed to examine and understand the evolution of a boiling bubble at the HIFU focus in a viscoelastic medium, little is known about the subsequent generation of cavitation clouds that form in between the boiling bubble and the HIFU transducer during boiling histotripsy insonation. Previous experimental observations suggest that the shock scattering by a boiling bubble may play a significant role in producing cavitation clouds. The main objective of the present study is, therefore, to investigate the relationship between the shock scattering phenomenon and the occurrence of cavitation clouds through (a) performing a numerical simulation of nonlinear wave propagation with the presence of a bubble at the HIFU focus and (b) comparing with the previous high speed camera observations of a cavitation cluster formation. The size of a bubble (i.e., 95.7, 128.1 and 258 mu m in diameter) as well as the HIFU exposure conditions (i.e., a driving frequency of 1.1 MHz, peak positive and negative pressures of 68.4 MPa and -13.9 MPa) used in the simulations were obtained from the previous boiling histotripsy experiments conducted with a tissue gel phantom. The numerical results presented in this study clearly demonstrate that the shock scattering is the main cause of the creation of a cavitation cluster in boiling histotripsy.

AB Classroom action research (CAR) is very important to be carried out by a teacher. However, it was found that very few teachers conducted classroom action research. This research is quantitative descriptive. The research aims to identify the teacher's initial ability to carry out the practice of classroom action research. The research subjects were math teachers of the Merauke consisting of 60 teachers. Data collection techniques using interview, questionnaire and observation methods. Analysis of research data with data reduction methods, data presentation and conclusion drawing. The results showed that 73% of teachers had never carried out CAR, 27% had implemented CAR. Most teachers, 85% said that CAR is very important and must be carried out by every teacher. There are still very high teachers who find it difficult to implement CAR, which is 81.7% with average difficulties for the CAR title component (30%) and Library (23.3%). The main need that is urgently needed immediately is mentoring CAR theory understanding (41.7%), proposal preparation assistance (36.7%) and CAR practice assistance (20%). The training model desired by the teacher is a workshop (40.1%) and practicum (31.8%).

AB To achieve cost-effective deployment of floating offshore wind farms, it is necessary to reduce mooring costs of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs). Beyond the cost, in terms of environmental impact, the seabed disrupted area due to mooring lines should be mitigated with care. The objective of this paper is to shed light on design parameters for cost-effective and low-footprint mooring configurations for FOWTs using coupled dynamic analyses. A design space is explored for mooring configurations with different pretension ratios, laid down length ratios and clump weight sizes. Ultimate and fatigue load cases are simulated in Open-Fast to compute the floater motions, mooring line tensions and fatigue damage. With constant pretension ratio of 0.15 and adding clump weights of 40t, mooring line length, mooring footprint and peak tension can be reduced by 14%, 15% and 9% respectively, while maximum surge and fatigue damage increase by 25% and 12% respectively. This paper will serve as a basis for further work on mooring design in the EU H2020 funded project COREWIND and provide a practical reference for the mooring system design for FOWTs.

AB The deformation behavior of capillary porous (CP) Ni and CP Ti is examined under uniaxial compression in air, water, and ethanol. CP metals contained inert liquids such as H(2)0 and C2H5OH are used as the heat pipes' active elements in space applications. The samples for mechanical testing were isostatic compacting and vacuum annealing (porosity of 60%). Uniaxial compression tests were carried out in the air, water, and ethanol in Shimadzu AG-50K XD (traverse rate 0.1 mm/min). It was shown that CP Ni and CP Ti exhibit the ductile deformation behavior in all cases, which is inherent to Ni and Ti. The ethanol environment induces the increase of the compression strength and the total deformation in both materials compared to deformation behavior in air and water. Therefore, a heat pipe's failure containing CP Ni and CP Ti matrixes and ethanol as the working body is caused rather by manufacturing defects, but not the structural materials' intrinsic properties.

AB The problem of the malleability of rhenium at room temperature is discussed. It has shown that rhenium manufactured by the mean of the electron beam melting is able to the mechanical treatment by rolling at room temperature. The primary condition for mechanical treatment is the minor share of the tensile stress in the processing scheme. It suppresses the grain boundary sliding in a coarse-grained workpiece of this refractory HCP-metal.

AB Task-lighting is a well-known strategy to save energy by bringing light where it is most needed, providing adaptable localised light conditions of special interest in the current home-office context. Despite these benefits and in addition to negatively impacting biological rhythms, the generalization of backlit screens has made task lights less demanded, with screen users tending to accept significantly lower amounts of the illuminance standards. In parallel, the advantages of task-lighting may contradict the energy benefits of presence-driven lighting or blinds automation. This pilot experiment aims at evaluating the task light usage patterns and characteristic preferences for both paper and computer work from a user-centered perspective to provide guidelines in terms of luminaires characteristics. Thirteen participants evaluated three different task lights in both paper and computer conditions. Our results emphasize the role of the luminaire's form factor, interface and lighting control characteristics, providing general recommendations on luminaire design.

AB The problem-solving skills is one of necessary competence to compete in twenty-first century. However, research about the impact of Project-based learning based science, technology, engineering and mathematics (PjBL-STEM) towards problem solving skills in the topic of electromagnetic induction is still limited. Faraday flashlight project as representative of basic development of modern technology in the topic of electromagnetic. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of Faraday flashlight in STEM integrated PjBL learning towards the increase in students' problem-solving skills. The mixed methods involved 36 senior high school students as participants. The research instrument was the Problem-Solving Skills Test, observation (panduan observasi), and interview. Data were analyzed by paired sample t-Test, N-gain, effect size, and data reduction. The result shows that PjBL-STEM had enough effect on students' problem-solving skills. This condition was caused by each syntax of PjBL based STEM, which could help students enhance their problem-solving skill. Students' skills in describing problems, utilization of Faraday induction approach, specific application of physics, and logical progression had increased in medium categories. However, mathematical procedures had a high category. Based on effect size criteria, PjBl based STEM had high effect on all problem-solving skill indicators.

AB At present, many methods are used to discussed about landslide problems, especially regarding the slip field from the perspective of a one-disciplinary or multidisciplinary approach. One of the approach is using the 2D resistivity geoelectrical method. This research has been carried out to identify landslide and slip fields in Citeko Village, Cisarua District, Bogor Regency using the dipole-dipole resistivity configuration on geoelectrical method. Measurements were made in three passes with 235 metress in length and 5 metress in electrode distance. Data were processed using Res2dinv software, and the results showed that in the study , area lithology of its subsurface rocks was detected, including alluvium and sand layers, weathered material, up to volcanic rocks. Then, there are also clay layers, silt clay layers, and sandstones. The slip fields could be analyzed like a clay layer with resistivity values ranging from 42.3 Omega m(-1) to 155 Omega m(-1), and its position was in line 1 and line 2, with a depth of 8.5 metres - 16.4 metres. It also identified in line 3 at the depth of 16.4 metres. Then, based on the interpretation of resistivity 3D modeling with Rockworks software from geoelectric data, it shows that the direction of the landslide tends to be centered towards the Northwest to the West, this is also supported by visual observations in the field.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has forced all communities to have technological knowledge, particularly in the education sector. This study aimed to introduce the integrative STEAM approach as a learning innovation in the COVID-19 pandemic for schools in South Kalimantan, Indonesia. The implementation of the 2013 thematic integrative curriculum in elementary schools is a unique challenge for parents in guiding their children. One of the suitable approaches following this demand is integrative STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics). This approach is able to perform creative and innovative learning by utilizing integrated technology in accordance with the 2013 Curriculum in elementary schools. The total of 120 correspondents participated in the service activities aimed to introduce this approach, and it consisted of Elementary School teachers and its students' aide in the South Kalimantan. This introductory activity began with the presentation of the approach, followed by a discussion session as well as questions and answers, which ends with an evaluation of its implementation by filling a questionnaire The results showed that 93.75% of the participants were interested in the presented topics since they aroused their curiosity. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is an increase in insight and knowledge about the integrative STEAM approach to the participants.

AB In this study we examine the summer cooling effects of trees and green facades on reducing urban heat island effects. Using ENVI-met model simulations, we investigate the influence of added greenery on the surface and ambient air temperature and its role on air fluctuations in the hot humid climate of Austin, TX, at pedestrian height. Under the specific conditions considered in this model, the results show the combination of trees and green facades has a greater cooling effect. Added greenery to the building mostly impacts the building ' s surface temperature during the hottest hours of the day, registering a maximum surface temperature reduction of 20.33 degrees C. Simulations also show a maximum overall potential air temperature reduction of 0.54 degrees C, and a maximum potential air temperature cooling effect near the building of 0.91 degrees C. Future research should be conducted to address this study ' s limitations. Nevertheless, these findings can provide architects, designers, planners, and policymakers with a better understanding of the many benefits trees and green facades have, and provide them with the necessary tools to implement new solutions across sectors and scales to reduce the impacts urban areas have on the environment and provide a better living for all.

AB The city of Lausanne is built on fairly steep slopes, with the consequence that some buildings are leaning against what could be described as cliffs and, therefore, have only one glazed facade. The Rue Saint Martin office building has been built during the 1970s. Because of its important depth (similar to 23m from the facade), the spaces located at the back were totally deprived of natural light. During the renovation of this building, the architects wanted to create large openings in the roof and in the floors' slabs in order to provide daylight to the rear spaces. The close collaboration between Estia(1) and Archespace(2) allowed for the design and implementation of an efficient daylighting system that provides a new quality of use for the interior spaces and a new identity for the building.

AB The digital world we are living in today offers viewers an experience of buildings before they even exist. This experience is no longer just geometric or descriptive, but also sensory. It generates emotions through fixed or animated images of 3 dimensional objects inserted in an urban context. These images are produced by specialized agencies with specific tools allowing them to generate visual artefacts with a striking impression of realism. The light that bathes these scenes is carefully worked out in order to capture our gaze. We believe that, in some cases, this may generate errors of appreciation and that these representations can lead to questionable choices when they are used in architectural competitions. This paper proposes some keys to analyse these sublimated images and aims to give the reader the possibility to interpret architectural projects in a more realistic way.

AB The study was designed to quantify the thermal conditions in tall atria in office buildings to serve as a starting point towards understanding their performance. The simulation study of a non-segmented and segmented atrium of 250 m height reveals indoor air temperature, wind velocity contours and wind pressure coefficients at various heights of each atrium type. In a hot and humid climate like that of Singapore, the internal temperatures within each atrium stack remain constant at 27 degrees C. However, the wind velocity in the non-segmented atrium (of 0.5 - 0.7 m/s) is lower than acceptable (0.9 m/s) for human occupancy. Adding segments and a larger inlet to the atrium solves the problem of low wind velocity without increasing the effective ambient temperature within the atrium stack. Additionally, the segmented atrium offers the advantage of displaying lower buoyancy forces by lowering the pressure differential within a tall stack thereby providing better comfort conditions.

AB The physics-based modeling has been the workhorse for many decades in many scientific and engineering applications ranging from wind power, weather forecasting, and aircraft design. Recently, data-driven models are increasingly becoming popular in many branches of science and engineering due to their non-intrusive nature (i.e., they are equation-free) and online learning capability. Despite the robust performance of data-driven models, they are faced with challenges of poor generalizability and difficulty in interpretation. These challenges have encouraged the integration of physics-based models with data-driven models, herein denoted hybrid analysis and modeling (HAM). We propose two different frameworks under the HAM paradigm for applications relevant to wind energy in order to bring the physical realism within emerging digital twin technologies. The physics-guided machine learning (PGML) framework reduces the uncertainty of neural network predictions by embedding physics-based features from a simplified model at intermediate layers and its performance is demonstrated for the aerodynamic force prediction task. Our results show that the proposed PGML framework achieves approximately 75% reduction in uncertainty for smaller angle of attacks. The interface learning (IL) framework illustrates how different solvers can be coupled to produce a multi-fidelity model and is successfully applied for the Boussinesq equations that govern a broad class of transport processes. The IL approach paves the way for seamless integration of multi-scale, multi-physics and multi-fidelity models (M-3 models).

ID COMFORT
AB In this paper, we present the results obtained by modelling the users' behaviours in a mixed mode office building in a tropical climate, more exactly in La Reunion. Few specific research studies on comfort in tropical climates have been published, and there is little feedback on the users' behaviour in these buildings.
   In order to improve users' assumptions in the design phase, users' actions on ceiling fans and windows have been measured and analysed. These data have then been modelled by machine learning methods, according to hygrothermal comfort and occupancy. The F1 scores eventually obtained for predicting fan use by random forests, decision trees and Bayesian networks are 99%, 98% and 95% respectively. For windows use, the F1 scores obtained are 92%, 91% and 70%, which demonstrates the ability of the models tested to predict the users' behaviours.

AB Wind farm parametrizations are nowadays commonly used to predict the output of wind farms in real-time numerical weather prediction mesoscale models. However, their accuracy both to reproduce the wind speed and turbulent kinetic energy fields behind turbines is a matter of debate. Here, and to the authors knowledge for the first time for a single turbine, the inbuilt wind farm parametrization of the Weather Research and Forecasting model is evaluated using detailed large-eddy simulations of the wake performed with a generalized actuator disk model that was implemented in the same modeling system. Thus, a fairer evaluation is achieved compared to previous works, as we try to set the simulations as similar as possible within the same modeling framework. We find that both types of simulations can be used to provide similar inflow conditions to the turbine. Most importantly, by comparing the detailed-wake results, within the area where the turbine is placed, with the mesoscale results at the analogous position, velocity deficits can differ up to 50%. However, within the same area, the vertical profile of turbine-generated TKE is nearly identical between the two types of simulations. Our findings demonstrate that the generalized actuator disk implementation can provide us with a solid foundation for evaluation of wind farm parametrizations within weather models.

This research is aimed at getting a picture of the knowledge of science teachers in applying learning using technological devices. A descriptive analysis research method was used. The test result data were obtained from 100 science teachers in Banten Province who answered the questions online as the sample. The research instruments consisted of 10 essay questions and a scoring rubric for the assessment. Test questions cover aspects of the application of learning methods, learning media, learning resources, assessments, and student learning outcomes. The Cronbach's instrument reliability coefficient value is 0.7. The average score of the test-takers in this research was 29.90 with a standard deviation of 17.31. Based on the categorization of the assessment results, the scores of the subjects were distributed as follows: 1% of the good category, 10% of the fair category, 40% of the poor category, and 49% of the very poor category. The analysis of the items indicates that the most difficult problems to be answered are the questions about learning methods and student learning outcomes.

AB We analyse for approaches to elimination of a fast variable, which are applicable for systems like passive Brownian particles: (i) moment formalism, (ii) corresponding cumulant formalism, (iii) Hermite function basis, (iv) formal 'cumulants' for the Hermit function basis. The accuracy and its strong order are assessed. The applicability and performance of two first approaches are also demonstrated for active Brownian particles.

AB Aggregated building energy demand is a useful indicator for urban energy planning. It can be used by planners and decision-makers to identify clusters of high energy demand in a given urban area and efficiently plan, for example, district heating networks. Various data sources exist at the pan-European level describing land use and built areas. Combined with statistical data, such maps have been used in previous research for estimating building energy performance aggregated at the hectare level, using engineering assumptions. In this paper, we show that large-scale land-use maps alone can be used for predicting annual building energy demand with an accuracy comparable to the one of previous engineering models. We hence present a preliminary method based on Convolutional Neural Networks at different spatial resolutions. The resulting model was trained and tested in an area of about 170 km(2) in Geneva (Switzerland) using a local annual heating demand dataset comprising 16239 buildings. On a 300-m aggregation tile, the obtained mean error (14.3%) is significantly reduced compared to the one of a simple linear model (37.2%). Using solely land-use data, we also achieve similar results for a 100-m tile as those of an engineering model from the literature.

AB A large-scale massive transport of Saharan dust over all of Europe was observed in the last third of April 2019. As part of the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET) and the Aerosol, Clouds and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure (ACTRIS), Sofia lidar station conducted lidar observations of the atmospheric aerosol load in this period. Some of the results obtained are described in this work. Remote measurements were implemented using two elastic-scatter lidar channels (1064 nm/532 nm). The paper presents results of studying and analyzing the optical and microphysical properties of the aerosols detected, as well as the topological and dynamical features of the aerosol/dust layers observed. The height profiles of the atmospheric aerosol backscattering coefficient are retrieved and discussed. The microphysical properties of aerosol/dust particles are characterized qualitatively based on an analysis of the backscatter-related Angstrom exponents profiles and distributions obtained for particular aerosol layers. Dust mixing with other aerosol types of local origin or such captured during the transport is also considered and discussed based on local meteorological radiosonde data and air-transport modeling and forecasting data. Conclusions are drawn concerning the experimentally ascertained and the possible impacts of the massive dust intrusion event on the local tropospheric aerosol structure and meteorological conditions.

AB A study is presented on supercapacitor prototypes using chimney soot as the active electrode material. Despite its highly developed surface and the existence of capacitive properties, some compounds present in chimney soot make it unstable during the charge process. The irreversible electrochemical process leads to anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction of the soot. In this work, chimney soot was treated electrochemically with different electrochemical potentials, thus altering the initial organic compounds in the material; different parts of organic compounds were affected, so that more stable compounds remained, without all functional groups being removed. The altered material was investigated by IR and TEM spectroscopy. Supercapacitor prototypes were subjected to charge-discharge cycles and their capacitances were determined and compared.

AB Human environmental perception leads occupants' behaviour when interacting with buildings components, affecting the final building energy performance. A solid understanding of human comfort perception includes simultaneous multisensory stimuli and cross-modal interactions among different comfort domains. This study aims to explore the cross-modal effect between thermal and acoustic domains. Each of the 40 subjects took part in a multisensory survey under two different stationary environmental temperature settings. Results show that people in thermally warm conditions are less confident in describing the provided acoustic records. To perform the same procedure but providing a decreasing air temperature ramp would lead to a better interpretation of the results of this campaign.

AB We discuss the optimization-based conceptual design of support structures and mooring system for floating wind turbines. A four degree-of-freedom frequency-domain model is used for the dynamic response of a spar floating wind turbine subjected to wind and wave loads. The framework allows for design optimization involving the geometrical properties of the floater and the mooring system and inclusion of long realizations of multiple load cases in the analysis. The adopted optimization approach adopted relies on analytical design sensitivities of the governing frequency-domain equations and of the design requirements. This ensures that modern gradient-based optimization algorithms can effectively be used to solve the design problem at hand. The optimization approach is applied to the design of the spar-buoy floater and its mooring system for the IEA 15 MW reference wind turbine. A post-processing approach for identifying discrete designs from predefined catalogues is also presented. The post-processing allows to transform continuous design solutions into practical ones that can be used in subsequent analyses with time domain response models for the full validation of the design solutions obtained. The numerical results highlight the capability of the approach discussed herein to provide discrete optimized designs for given design constraints and loads in few minutes requiring modest computational resources and time.

AB The roles of coffee commodities for the Indonesia economy are quite important. They are as a source of income for coffee farmers, foreign exchange sources, industrial raw materials producers, as well as employment providers through processing, and also marketing and trade (export and import). This research was conducted with the aims: (1) To know the impact of multiplier caused by coffee commodities to economy of East Java province.; (2) To know the value of coffee commoditis sector relation to other sectors that support the economy in East Java province. The results showed: (1) Coffee commodities have an impact of multiplier on East Java province's economy of 1.115. It means that if there is a change in demand in coffee sector of one million rupiah while final demand in other sectors does not change; it will increase the use of output of other sectors either directly of indirectly Rp. 1.115.000,-. (2) Coffee commodities have direct and indirect inter-sectoral values of 1,854. It means that if there is an increase in demand for coffee commodities sector of one million rupiah. It will increase the supply of inputs among the whole in the economy of East Java province of 1.854 million rupiah or Rp. 1.854.000,-.

AB Assessment activities can help lecturer to understand the strengths and weaknesses experienced by students in learning. By implementing quality assessments and analyzing them to get information about student learning weaknesses, lecturers have a reference to make effective decisions in the learning process. Ability to understand is very important to solve physics problem. Geometric optics is a concept that occur in our daily life. In contrary, it doesn't ensure students have correct concept about geometric optics.The purpose of this study is to diagnose students' level of understanding in geometric optics concept. This study used mixed method design. The sample used in this study was Mechanical Engineering students who took Engineering Physics courses. Based on test result data using paired sample t-test, the average score was obtained from 39.08 to 75.76 (p<0.01). The results of data analysis from the three-tier test diagnostic instrument showed that there are 4 level of students' understanding such as understand, guess, misconception, and don't understand the concept. This study revealed the students' difficulties such as students were not been able to analyze terms and conditions of f = R/2 and light refraction in half covered lens.

AB Understanding how students perceive global warming concept is important for their metacognition. A total of 241 junior high school students including all grades were involved in this research. With an open-ended question, this research identified students' perception of global warming concept. Semantic network analysis was chosen as the method to determined and displayed students' perception by checking the connection of the words used to response the open-ended question. After the process of analysis, there were there main statements from students to define global warming: (1) Increase of earth temperature, (2) depletion of ozone layer, and (3) greenhouse gas and human activities as the cause of global warming. The result of this research can be used to develop the teaching method which can motivate the students' scientific thinking.

AB In order to limit global warming, remaining carbon budgets have been defined by the IPCC in 2018. In this context translating global goals to local realities implicates a set of different challenges. Standardized methodologies of allocation can support a target-cascading process. On the other hand, local strategies and norms are not currently designed to directly respond to limited carbon budgets in a 2050 horizon. The life cycle assessment of buildings implicates an intricate cross-industry and cross-border carbon accounting. For these reasons, effective and aligned carbon targets are needed to support and guide all actors in the construction sector. This research aims at addressing these challenges by developing a new methodology of allocation of a global carbon budget at different scales using the Swiss built environment as a case study. This approach allows the assessment of current best practices in regards to limited carbon budgets. Results show misalignment of global goals with current practices at all levels and present the magnitude of effort that would be required to have a chance to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C.

AB The paper describes the environmental education teaching model, in which students actively participate in solving global environmental problems directly during formal secondary education. Education is based on the principles of personal commitment of students; effective interconnection of online and outdoor education; linking environmental education with current sustainable development goals; combining individual work of students with group problem solving; use of diverse ICT in individual phases of teaching. The model is based on interdisciplinary collaboration and connects outdoor education, information and communication technologies, individual and collaborative work of students and can be used in traditional and online education.

AB The purpose of this study is to develop food security behaviours in rural communities. The place of this research was conducted in the village of Banyubiru, Labuan district, Pandeglang regency, Banten Province, Indonesia. The method used in this study was an experiment with the design of forming three village community groups, each group consisting of 15 people. The instrument used in this study was a food security behaviours questionnaire test and an observation sheet during the implementation of the corn labyrinth educational game. The results of the questionnaire of resistance behaviours in the village community in Labuan Banten amounted to 66.83% or 0.67 in the good category. Furthermore, the observations during using the labyrinth educational game of 72.50% or 0.73 are in the good category. So it can be concluded that the behaviours of food security can be grown through learning activities through the design of a corn maze educational game.

AB In this paper we present an investigation of the influence of nanoindentation location on the top surface of silicon micro-pillar. This silicon micro-pillar array which will be employed as a micro force sensor array based on three-dimension silicon (3D Si) structures, is fabricated by near UV nanoimprint lithography (NIL) technique and etched by Cryogenic Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) sequentially. To determine its mechanical properties, those micropillars are measured by instrument indentation testing (IIT) to obtain its hardness and reduced modulus. For the measurement, a Berkovich diamond indenter is utilized to penetrate a single and also multiple point indentations on a micro-pillar surface. Afterwards, these results are compared to the indentation at the central point of the tested pillar and Si bulk as its reference to examine the influence of different probing locations on the measured reduced modulus and hardness.

AB Pre-eclampsia is a complication in pregnancy that is often diagnosed by hypertension and proteinuria in the second tri-semester of pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia could cause suffering for mother and fetus and also increase the risk of mother and child death. The main objective of this research is to develop an expert system to identify the risk of pre-eclampsia in pregnant women. The device was designed with 16 inputs in the form of symptoms and risk factors that influence the disease. This system uses the Dempster Shafer method for classification of 2 classes: there is a risk of pre-eclampsia and no risk of preeclampsia. The test consists of 2 aspects, namely the performance test and user satisfaction test. The results of the research for the performance test showed that the system accuracy reached 88.18% with sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value, and Negative Predictive Value were 92.72%, 83.63%, 85%, and 92%. User satisfaction test results show "good" in all aspects.

AB The background of this research was the limitation of interactive multimedia for identifying the plants. One method for identifications is using a determination key that contains statements between two alternative choices and then followed by a further choice that will ultimately lead to the level of the taxonomy. However, the available key determinations are based on websites which can only be accessed if the internet is available and only in English, Belgian and Korean. This research produce an interactive multimedia application (e-KeyPlant) as a media for identifying seed plants. The method used was ADDIE (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate) approach. The population was oppinion of e-KeyPlant involved 50 respondents (biology lecturers, graduate students, undergraduate students, laboratory assistants majoring in biology education and biology teachers). The data obtained was a quantitative data from the results of validation, questionnaire responses to satisfaction of the application used. Validation by experts on the application resulted in an average value of 89,74% (content) and 83,06% (design). This study concludes that the e-KeyPlant application can be used as a learning media for identifying seed plants and suitable for use in learning.

AB Concerns about mathematics learning are rarely associated with life contexts, giving ideas to teachers and researchers developing didactic phenomenon-based learning. Didactic phenomenology is defined as a bridge to study mathematical concepts. Unfortunately, the use of didactic phenomena still leaves problems when formalizing the idea, including the concept of spherical volume. The qualitative method was chosen with a didactic phenomenological design, to explore the transposition of spherical volume construction, to strengthen the results of didactic phenomena based learning. By utilizing didactic phenomena and assuming students know the surface area of the sphere informally, the spherical volume can show. Formally with the concept of the volume of a rotating object and double integrals can be proven the volume of the sphere. With the idea of vector and limit the surface area and volume of the sphere can be determined as students know it. Further studies need to do regarding research collaboration mechanisms that involve teachers and academics so that the efforts of teachers in utilizing various didactic phenomena have a foundation of thinking that can be scientifically justified.

AB This article dicussses how the SPRIDER learning model is used to improve student's critical thinking in natural science learning junior high school. Critical thinking skills are a person's ability to analyze ideas or ideas logically, reflectively, sistematically and productively to help making evaluation and decisions about what is believed or will be done so can solve the problem. The development model used in this study is the Thiagarajan 4-D development model. Result of the need analysis questionnaire, overall 100% of teachers support the development of learning models that are integrated with religious aspects with expectations that it will strengthen the student's religious character to produce an intelligent and religious generation. The first syntax model for SPRIDER is stimulation; provide a stimulus that student interested in the material to be studied with religious integration. The second stage is problem orientation; provide problems that can improve student's critical thinking skills. The third stage is reading; student read material related to the problem given. The fourth stage is investigation; students conduct investigations in groups to solve problems. The fifth stage is discussion; students dicuss in their groups to find solutions. The sixth stage is evaluation; the last stage where the teacher will evaluate the learning activities that have been implemented to determine the level of student's understanding about the material that has been learned.

AB Collaborative problem-solving (CPS) is an essential competency in the 21st century. However, this skill is quite complex due to the two-dimensional domain having to measure at once. This study is a literature review aimed to presents various CPS measurement methods from empirical research for the past 17 years. Hence, teachers can get insight to implement and to develop CPS assessment mainly for training students to solve complex problems. Based on this review, there are two broad methods to measure CPS including using computer environment and real-life context. The former allows measurement to be more accurate and quicker, while the latter enables students to experience face-to-face interaction during problem solving. However, the development of CPS assessment using a computer needs professional ICT and an adequate number of computers as well as a high internet connection. In Indonesia, the implementation of computer-based assessment faces many challenges, and only some schools in the city centre can meet that requirement. Hence, it can be an alternative to measure the interaction of students during the CPS activity by putting high consideration of the using pedagogical content to facilitate CPS environment.

AB The research aimed to get a valid and tested VCCLab model product complete with syntax and supportive materials. This research is encouraged by the need for a VCCLab model for remedial teaching oriented towards remediation of students' misconceptions through the mode of virtual laboratory activity. The research method used is research & development which consists of four stages, namely: Need Analysis, Product Development, Field Testing, and Product Revision. From the development research process, the VCCLab model product is produced with syntax consisting of five stages of lab activity. The results of expert judgement on the VCCLab model product indicate that the VCCLab model and supporting materials have a construct and content validity. The results of limited field testing indicate that the use of the VCCLab model in remedial teaching activities with the mode of virtual lab activity has high effectiveness in remediating students' misconceptions regarding the concept of parallel electric circuit. Another field testing result is that there is no gender bias in the use of the VCCLab model in the students' conception reconstruction process related to the physics concept being reviewed.

AB Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) works by using the principle of frequency shifting in quartz crystals due to mass deposition on the surface of the crystals. QCM sensors can be applied as chemical sensors and gas sensors. To increase its sensitivity and selectivity, QCM must be coated with active ingredients, one of which is Polyaniline (Pani). There are several methods for the Pani layer deposition above QCM. In this study, the evaporative deposition method was carried out. The purpose of this study was to analyse the effect of deposition time on the thickness and impedance value of the Pani layer. Before being coated by Pani, QCM was given a polystyrene coating to increase its adhesion. The variation of deposition time used was 10; 15; 30 and 60 seconds. The characterization carried out was measured the impedance of the layer by using an impedance analyser, observing the layer morphology by using an optical microscope, and determining the thickness of the layer using the Saurbrey equation approach. The results showed that the longer the deposition time caused the Pani layer to be deposited thicker and had a more even morphology. The layer impedance value was also getting bigger. The maximum thickness obtained at the deposition time of 60 seconds was 32.21 mu m with a layer impedance value of 891.57 Omega With a huge impedance value, the Pani layer provides a substantial damping effect on QCM.

AB This study aims to determine the percentage of biology misconceptions especially in ecosystem topics at senior high school. Ecosystem topics are basic in science. But there are still many students were got difficulties in understanding the concept, that causing misconceptions. A misconception is an explanation of the phenomenon according to the experience and student's previous knowledge. This study used a descriptive statistics method. Profiling data was used to describe the percentage of mastery concept students and misconceptions. Multiple-Choice tests were chosen to measure the understanding of concept mastery and misconceptions in ecosystem topics. The results have shown the average of percentage in mastering conception is 58.65%, while the average percentage of misconception is 41.01%. It means misconceptions that are inversely proportional to the understanding of student concepts. Therefore, to reduce the misconceptions that emerge a needed an improved understanding of the concept.

AB In this work, solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) based poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) have been prepared with carbon dots (C-dots) and C-dots/manganese oxide or C-dots/(MnO2)(x) (x = 0, 2, 4 mM) addition. C-dots synthesized by low-temperature heating oven using cassava peels as a carbon source. Furthermore, C-dots/(MnO2)(x) prepared with C-dots solution as media for reducing potassium permanganate (KMnO4) into MnO2. C-dots/(MnO2)(x )solutions were characterized by UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. The SPE samples with C-dots/(MnO2)(x) addition were characterized by electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We provided the information that the presence of C-dots/(MnO2)(x )has accelerated and facilitated the ionic transport in the SPE. These results reveal that C-dots/(MnO2)(x) nanocomposite is a good candidate for SPE.

Round wires are fabricated by powder-in-tube (PIT) method and hotisostatic-press (HIP) technique. To increase I-c keeping the diameter of the wire constant, the cross section area of the superconducting core is enlarged by changing the dimensions of metal sheaths. At 4.2 K under a high field of 100 kOe, J(c) of a short segment of HIP wire reaches 42 kAcm(-2), which is comparable to the highest J(c) of IBS round wires of 44 kAcm(-2). Furthermore, I-c of the HIP wire at 4.2 K under 10 kOe and 100 kOe reaches 95 A and 54 A, respectively, which is about twice the value of the previous report. We also fabricated a small demonstration superconducting coil using 12.5 m long PIT wires by HIP method. I-c of the whole coil is similar to 60 A under the self-field, and magnetic field at the center of the coil reaches 2.6 kOe. The coil generated the magnetic field of 43 Oe /A, which is almost consistent with the calculated field from the coil dimensions.

AB In high temperature superconducting (HTS) applications, joining two HTS wires is considered as an essential process for extending the available length. Many soldering and diffusion joints have been designed in recent years, but these joints mainly focused on joining two HTS virgin tapes with 4mm width and 0.15mm thickness. As for the recently developed soldered-stacked (SS) HTS wire, it does not have applicable methods of joining. In this paper, we proposed a novel technique to join two SS wires by soldering and stacking, and measured the joint resistance to demonstrate its feasibility of engineering. First, we join separate layers in SS wires using spot-welding machine. Second, we coat these layers in the solder bath. This method allows making joints and manufacturing SS wires simultaneously. This work will introduce the specification of this jointing method for SS wire, and the related experimental results will provide a reference for the SS wire joint fabrication in the future.

ID FILMS
AB Thin HfO2 films were deposited on polished microscope glass substrates by DC magnetron sputtering at bias voltages of -85 V, -100 V, -115 V, -130 V and -145 V. The deposited films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometry. The XRD results show the presence of a polycrystalline monoclinic phase. The roughness calculated from the AFM images increases as the bias voltage is raised to -130 V and then starts decreasing. The effect was also investigated of the bias voltage on the optical properties of the HfO2 films.

AB The building envelope acts as a shield against varying weather conditions and modulates thermal energy flow between outdoors and indoors. The choice of layers used in the assembly impacts the heat loss and gain through the wall structure and potentially can affect the comfort indoors. Thus, the building envelope plays an essential role in the thermal performance of the building. Optimizing the cladding design in the envelope has recently become increasingly important to reach sustainable development strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This paper aims to analyze several cladding types used on the EPFL campus in Lausanne and compare their impact on the energy performance of the building envelopes. The building assemblies constructed on the EPFL campus in different years vary in composition and thermo-physical properties of the layers used. The impact of these parameters on the thermal performance of the wall assembly is evaluated by comparing the variation of heat flux and temperature fluctuations within the wall structure. The results obtained highlight the importance of the building envelope layers and materials used in the wall structure. Due to the variations in the thermal inertia of different wall assemblies, a time shift of more than 3 hours in the transient response of the building envelope to the fluctuation of the outdoor weather conditions is observed.

AB The challenge of the industrial revolution 4.0 (4IR) demands that future generations have high knowledge, skills, and capabilities in technology. A country's competitiveness depends on STEM human capital as 4IR develops. Therefore, more organized and holistic actions need to be taken to ensure that the STEM level of mastery is enhanced among students. High demand for STEM human capital is a challenge to most developed countries in the world. Teachers are a crucial medium in the implementation of STEM education in schools. Mastering the knowledge of teachers in STEM education will provide positive input to students' interest in learning. The purpose of this study was to identify the mathematics teacher's knowledge of STEM-based education. A quantitative study was conducted on 66 teachers - who teach STEM subjects in high school. Twenty-three of them are math teachers. The findings show that these teachers know STEM education at a moderate level. The implications of this study indicate that the mastery of teachers 'knowledge of STEM education will stimulate students' interest in STEM education. Future studies can explore, the factors that influence teachers' knowledge of STEM education in terms of teacher preparation and in-service teacher professional development programs.

AB Indonesia is a multicultural country with a variety of cultures, one of which is Reog Ponorogo. Reog Ponorogo is a traditional dance passed down from generation to generation as a culture and identity of the Ponorogo society. Unfortunately, many people considered that Reog Ponorogo only as entertainment that does not contain scientific concepts. This research investigates physics concepts, especially Newton's Law in Dadhak Merak dance of Reog Ponorogo. This research used the content analysis method involving unitizing, sampling, recording, reducing, inferring, and narrating. The result indicated that Newton's First Law came up in the inertial frame of the Dadhak Merak. Newton's Second Law is shown in the acceleration changes influenced by the mass and force of Pembarong. Newton's Third Law is related to the dancer's reaction force and the ground that raises a lateral force to the Dadhak Merak dance. This research is expected to contribute as a source of information on the development of contextual teaching and learning physics material.

AB This research was motivated by the variation of e-learning in 21st-century education used in elementary schools during the corona pandemic. The study aimed to determine the differences in the effectiveness of e-learning variations based on Google Classroom and Edulogy in elementary school students about Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) in the corona pandemic. This type of research was quantitative, with quasi-experiment the PosttestOnly Control-Group design. The subjects in this study were 38 students of grade V elementary school in the even semester of the academic year 2019/2020. Data was collected using interviews and test instruments in the form of problem descriptions to test the ability to do HOTS questions. The results showed that the value of Sig. (2-tailed) = 0.011 was smaller than alpha = 0.05 which indicates that H0 is rejected and Ha is accepted. It was implied that there were differences in posttest results between e-learning based on Google Classroom and e-learning based on Edulogy that affect the effectiveness of e variations -learning. The features of Google Classroom such as assignment, grading, communication, time-cost, archive course, privacy, and mobile application facilitate the learning process of blended learning methods.

AB The instrument was made as an effective way to measure students' science self-efficacy in a particular topic such as environmental pollution during the implementation of STEM Learning. A sample of 65 students grade 8th near West Java was involved in this study. The instrument consists of 28 statements, which are divided into six aspects of science self-efficacy which are conceptual understanding, high order cognitive skill, everyday application, science communication, physiological state, and practical work. The process of developing instrument consists of several steps: (1) conduct literature review, (2) construct students' science self-efficacy, (3) validity and readability test, and (4) conduct test. Rasch Analysis Model is used to analyze the data using version 4.4.5 of the Winstep Application. The result shows Cronbach's alpha value is 0.91, which means the interaction between items and the person as a whole is in a very good category. It could be used as an instrument for another implication.

AB Monitoring of fibre composites is an important task to spread the application of fibre composites. Cure monitoring of the polymer matrix of fibre composites during the fabrication can be realized with interdigital sensors. The measured impedance can be directly related to the curing process. However wiring the sensor may disrupt the material, therefore sensing should be done wireless. As many fibre composites are processed under high temperature and high pressure conditions no electronics can be used inside the material. Here we present the design, fabrication, and characterization of a wireless sensory system using a chipless strategy for online cure monitoring. For this purpose, different combinations of sensors and readers are designed, consisting of a planar inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, where capacitance is an interdigital capacitor, and an inductor as antenna operating wirelessly through inductive coupling. The designs are realized onto flexible polyimide substrate using microfabrication technology. To characterize the coupling effect, the response of the reader antenna has been carried out when sensor is placed in its vicinity. Furthermore, the curing process of adhesive is demonstrated and results are discussed. It is shown that the curing process of a thermoset polymer can be monitored by a flexible chipless LC resonator wirelessly.

AB Humans in the 21st century spend nearly 90% of their time in an indoor environment. This environment is far from the one in which humans have developed their physiological adaptation and regulation mechanisms. The indoor environment must be optimized for wellbeing and cognitive performance with an anthropocentric and multidisciplinary approach. The objective of this paper is to identify and evaluate the reliability of approaches to characterize thermal comfort in a humid tropical climate. To do so, we will present (i) an experiment conducted to evaluate this perception in a quantitative (physical measurements) and qualitative (field survey) way, and finally (iii) an intermodal and experimental comparison analysis. The results reveal some notable discrepancies between numerical approaches and experimental data. This finding reinforces our study perspectives on the need to engage a multimodal and multidisciplinary analysis to improve the accuracy of comfort models.

AB During the COVID-19 pandemic, the education system was faced with a situation that required teachers to master distance learning media. Distance learning is still a polemic among the community, this is because distance learning is still considered no better than conventional direct learning, especially in mathematics learning that requires understanding of concepts to be able to master the material. The purpose of this research is find out which method is better between the class using the distance learning method during the COVID-19 pandemic and the class using the conventional direct method. This type of research conducted in this study is ex post facto research with a causal comparative design. The sample in this study was class 11th grade of the 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 school year at one of the senior high school in Sukabumi. Mathematics learning outcome data is obtained from the end of semester exam results, the data is then processed using the Mann-Whitney nonparametric difference test. The results showed that there were differences in mathematics learning outcomes between students who used the distance learning method and students who used conventional direct methods, and students who used distance learning had better results than students who used conventional direct methods

AB The cable layout optimisation for floating offshore wind farms is a complex task due to the number of elements involved and their nature, such as dynamic cables with buoyant sections. The first step is defining a model of the suspended cables that connect wind turbines between them or to cables on the seabed (risers). A lumped mass model and the finite element method are used to find the static position and mechanical stresses of the cables, keeping a balance between computational time and the quality of the results. The model allows the inclusion of standard ancillary equipment such as bend stiffeners, buoyancy modules, clamps and tethers in order to simulate multiple configurations: double hanging, single hanging (catenary), lazy wave, steep wave and tethered wave. The external actions considered are marine growth and currents and the main cable properties are taken into account to calculate its weight, buoyancy, tensions, moments and drag forces. The information obtained after the simulation includes cable tensions, curvature, laid and suspended lengths and tether tension, when applicable. Next steps include the optimisation of the suspended cables and the full network in the farm.

AB In everyday life, we are always faced with problems. In trying to solve problems, we need higher-order thinking. One of higher-order thinking is critical thinking. Critical thinking includes critical thinking dispositions and skills. The critical thinking dispositions are an attitude or soul to develop critical thinking skills. This study aimed to describe the validity and reliability of the inventory of critical thinking dispositions. Testing of inventory used survey research. The testing was conducted at the public senior high schools in Buleleng Bali Indonesia. The population of the study was 4579 students from natural science classes. The samples were determined using the proportionate stratified random sampling technique. By the margin of error of 5%, the minimum number of samples needed was 355 people. By considering a return rate of 80%, the number of samples drawn was 444 people. The number of questionnaires returned by the students was 443. The data obtained were analyzed using the moment product correlation statistics and Cronbach's Alpha to determine the validity and reliability of inventory, respectively. The results showed that the instrument's validity is in the range of 0.095 to 0.756. Meanwhile, the reliability of the instrument is 0.727. There are two invalid items from 62 items. It can be concluded that this inventory of critical thinking dispositions can be used to measure the critical thinking dispositions of senior high school students.

AB This paper presents a time-sequential probabilistic simulation model for the detailed design of maintenance strategies for turbine critical items. The term item shall refer to any part, component, device, subsystem, or functional unit of a wind turbine that can be individually described and considered. The model enables wind farm operators and turbine manufactures to find the most cost-effective maintenance strategy for each turbine critical item. Cost optimizations are realized through a better adaptation of the maintenance strategy to the item-specific failure modes, degradation processes, failure detection capabilities and the given operational configuration of the wind farm. Based on a time-sequential Monte Carlo simulation technique, the maintenance activities at turbine level are simulated over the windfarm's operational lifetime, considering correlations between the stochastic variables. The results of the Monte Carlo simulation are evaluated using statistical means, thereby, determining the optimal maintenance strategy and associated parameters. The developed model is implemented as a Python application and equally applicable for onshore and offshore windfarms.

AB Novel nematic states as well as remarkable superconducting properties were reported in iron-based superconductors. We synthesized high-quality single crystals of (Ba1-xRbx)Fe2As2 close to the optimal composition of x approximate to 0.4, and have characterized normal state and superconducting properties for pristine and proton irradiated samples. The highest T-c was found to be similar to 36.6 K for pristine samples. A maximum critical current density of 12 MA/cm(2) was achieved in a proton irradiated sample, which is comparable to that in irradiated (Ba0.6K0.4)Fe2As2. Twin boundaries were observed optically in both non-doped and under-doped samples. We also attempted local magnetic field measurements induced by transport current in a sample with twin boundaries for future exploration of nematic states in different regions of doping.

AB Radon is a natural radioactive gas that may cumulate in indoor environments. The impacts of weather events on indoor radon concentration had been explored in different places around the world but only marginally in Switzerland. Using basic statistical analysis, this study investigates different meteorological parameters' influence on indoor radon concentrations and shows that outdoor air temperature is the most influential beyond others. Finally, this paper highlights the importance of radon dynamic in buildings, a topic often overlooked by construction professionals and the broader public in Switzerland.

AB Laser Doppler Vibrometers (LDVs) are exceptionally well suited to non-contact vibration sensing applications in various environments. This work focuses on diarisation of conversations that might be recorded via a drone-mounted LDV by reducing the effect of external noise, extracting useful features from frames of audio and clustering them into homogenous segments based on speaker identity. The two-step noise reduction (TSNR) technique was introduced to these vibroacoustic data for the first time and tested against Gaussian bandpass filtering for noise reduction from sources such as laser speckle and additional broadband 'white' noise. Feature extraction was then performed using a time-delay neural network, with the grouping of frames to a particular speaker tested with various clustering methods. Each noise reduction and clustering technique combination were tested on a twospeaker conversation recorded via the LDV. In the case of no added noise, the most effective combination was found to be the TSNR/Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) combination with a diarisation error rate of 6.13%. In the case of additional broadband noise, the most effective combination was found to be TSNR followed by Gaussian bandpass filtering then clustering via AHC with a diarisation error rate of 11.9%. With this work, another aspect of the challenge of covertly obtaining and interpreting vibroacoustic intelligence in remote and hostile environments using LDVs has been addressed.

AB Education for sustainable development (ESD) is a concern for not only Indonesian government but also worldwide. To create sustainable education, every individual has the responsibility to keep ESD as valuable capital for today's and future generations. The aim of this study to get information on the level of awareness about sustainability in protecting planet Earth. In addition, This study aims to work out the extent of sustainable awareness within the concept of sustainable development education among pre-service physics teacher based on gender at one of the universities in Tasikmalaya. Data collection was administered employing a closed questionnaire. The results showed that the sustainability awareness of students with an average value of 0.77 was in the high criteria. However, the sustainability practice awareness category includes the standards of rarely done. In addition, the sustainability awareness of female students is relatively higher compared to male students with percentage ratio of 78.1% and 75.5%. In conclusion, although they have a high level of sustainability awareness, students are "still less effective" in the category of "sustainability practice awareness with performance" and "practice some attitudes in making practices that support sustainable development".

AB This paper describes a simulation study of the measurement of the flexural deflection of a thin plate, excited by a transverse force at the fundamental frequency of the resonance modes, using an optical system consisting of multiple cameras. The estimate of the amplitude of the vibration is obtained starting from two or more sequences of images taken by the cameras, by means of triangulation. In this paper, we assume that the system is calibrated, and we focus on the error resulting from pixellisation. The simplified optical model is used to simulate how the accuracy of the measurements varies with respect to: the distance of the cameras from the structure; the opening angle between pairs of cameras; the resolution of the cameras and their number. The aim of the work is to evaluate the influence of the cameras arrangement on the measurement quality, and in particular if the use of a number greater than 2 cameras can allow a reduction of the measurement error, allowing a favorable compromise between spatial and temporal resolution of the cameras. As an example, the average error of the reconstruction of the first flexural deflection shape falls from 12% to 4%, when the measurement setup passes from 2 cameras to 12 cameras in the considered setup.

AB This study aims to provide information about the characteristics of eco dome as tool for greenhouse effect experiments. This research uses experimental method. This research was held in 2019 at FMIPA Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia. Experiment used eco dome include: the effect of presence of plants inside of eco dome towards changing temperature and the effect of administration of CO2 in eco dome that presence of plants towards changing temperature. Data collection was done by measuring the temperature and intensity of light. Data analysis uses statistical tests. The result of this experiment was temperature in eco dome which has no plants inside is higher rather than temperature in eco dome which present plants inside. Another result is the added of CO2 in eco dome which contain plant has higher temperature rather than eco dome which has no CO2 added. Experiments shows the eco dome has characteristics in showing significant results and can be developed various potency.

AB Physics education researchers have put out a large number of papers about attitudes. Yet, only few papers employed Rasch model to analyze data of attitudes. This paper reports a comparative study of students' attitudes toward physics from rural and urban high schools (n=130). In order to collect data of attitudes toward physics, the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) was administered online to participated students. Obtained data were analyzed by using Rasch model and t-test. Prior Rasch analysis revealed that all items of the CLASS were fitted the Rasch model and had good psychometric properties. The present research found that there were no significant differences between rural and urban students in terms of attitudes toward physics. This result was in line with some earlier finding, but contrary to other previous result. One of variables probably affecting this outcome was teachers' unawareness of technology usage and other school facilities to enhance teaching quality.

AB Critical thinking skills must be included in the classroom learning process since it is an important aspect of 21st century learning. This study was intended to investigate high school Mathematics teachers' perception of the learning models associated with students' critical thinking skills. This study was conducted through a survey and the respondents were 44 Mathematics teachers from various high schools in several cities in Indonesia. Random sampling technique was employed to decide the subjects of the study. The research instrument used was a questionnaire and it was distributed by using Google Form. The data were then analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. The results revealed that high school Mathematics teachers recognized various innovative learning models. Moreover, the teachers had a positive perception of critical thinking implementation in learning. They took the learning model which was appropriate to develop high school students' critical thinking in learning Mathematics. Most teachers chose and applied problem-based learning models to improve high school students' critical thinking skills.

AB Most of the global dynamic response models used today for the design of wind turbines are based on the aero-hydro-servo-elastic analysis of one single turbine. However, research on bottom-fixed offshore wind turbines has shown that interactions among turbines in a farm influence both the power production and the structural loading. Furthermore, floating wind turbines (FWTs) are sensitive to low-frequency variations, and therefore to wake meandering perturbations. In the current work, we use the Dynamic Wake Meandering (DWM) model as implemented in DIWA and FAST.Farm, to study the low-frequency content of the meandering at a target turbine placed 8 diameters downstream. At frequencies in the range of the natural frequencies of rigid body motions of semisubmersible floaters, the two models yield different results. These differences are seen for every wind speed and wind turbine model, even though they decrease as the wind speed increases. The observed differences may affect low-frequency motions and consequently mooring system design.

AB The rapid development of digital technology has stimulated teachers with the number of competencies called digital literacy. The purpose of this study was to describe gender differences in digital literacy among prospective physics teachers. This research was conducted using a descriptive method involving 71 prospective physics teachers at a university in Tasikmalaya. They consisted of 31 males and 40 females with age 19-21 years old. Data was collected using valid digital literacy tests and interview. The collected data was processed by determining the average score of male and female students then analyzed through interview. The results showed that the mean of male's digital literacy was higher than female. The males had a mean 57 (moderate category) and the females had a mean 53 (low category). There was a difference in digital literacy between males and females prospective physics teachers. These distinctions were influenced by their tendency in using digital technology. Some recommendations were delivered to prospective physics teachers, especially for females. They should effectively increase their digital technology use and appropriate training in the use of digital technology is needed to achieve a higher level of digital literacy.

AB Despite their rapid growth, renewable energies cannot provide energy on demand, which is an essential requirement for heating buildings. To this end, we developed heat exchangers with Phase Change Materials that allow the on-demand charge, storage and discharge of thermal energy. In this paper we evaluate the storage capacities needed to achieve thermal energy autonomy. An existing reference house, meteorological data from MeteoSwiss and solar radiation intensity were used to evaluate the thermal needs and the solar power production for the year 2019. To heat the building an air-water heat pump is preferably powered by solar energy. The calculations have been performed from October to March. Using 1200 litres of PCM, a thermal autonomy of 100% was achieved for March and October. In February, November and December, 24 days could not reach a thermal autonomy. For the month of January that was studied in detail 15 days are self-sufficient. By increasing the PCM volume to 2'600 litres 5 more days become self-sufficient. To achieve total building heating autonomy, seasonal storage is necessary.

AB Remote working proved to be an advantage in terms energy-saving as well as, for many, in terms of quality of life, while it was a necessity during the pandemic crisis of 2020/2021. This new habit is now promoted by many big enterprises due to associated cost savings. Some experiences of remote working in different locations have started to be supported by incentives in small municipalities to repopulate remote locations in Italy and people are now more inclined to move not just for vacation. These conditions could lead to a sort of "climatic nomadism" achievable, among other, through transportable homes. The net-zero energy Green and Transportable Modular Building (GTMB) project is able to cut its environmental impact. It can assume different configurations according to the user's needs. The house is based on a timber construction system, easily adjustable and adaptable according to a modular framework. The energy performance has been simulated by means of BIM/BEM methodologies. The building has been tested in two different climates and configurations according to variable social interaction. The energy balance of the house in the life cycle showed the achievement of a carbon zero balance mainly due to timber technology, a heat pump, and PV integration.

AB One of problem in mechanics is vertical body motion in upward and downward direction due to gravitational and resistance forces. In this paper, we are interested to analyse the effect of quadratic resistance force respect to the instantaneouly velocity and position of the body. The equation of the vertical body motion affected by gravitational and quadratic resistance forces derived using the second Newton law generally in the form of Riccati differential equation of constant coefficients. Therefore we need a method for solving the mathematics model. For the purpose we introduce a closed form solution for Riccati differential equation of constant coeficients based on discriminant criteria that can be used to solve the analytic model of vertical body motion by simple manner.

AB Mathematical communication has an important role in the problem solving process. One factor that can support mathematical communication skills is learning style. It is important for teachers to analyze their students learning styles, so that the information obtained can help to be more sensitive in understanding differences in class and can make learning more meaningful. This research aims to describe a mathematical communication of students based on Kolb's learning styles of assimilator and accommodator type. This research used a qualitative descriptive method. The subjects of this research consisted of two Junior High School students who were selected using purposive sampling. The instruments used in this research were tests and questionnaires, while the data validity used the triangulation method. The data analysis was performed through data collection, data reduction, data presentation, and conclusion. The research result shows that the assimilator type students were able to describing the problem situation in the form of geometry and using mathematical solutions related to the analysis of other forms. While the student with accommodator type can investigate about what is known and describes the problem situation in the form of geometry.

AB This study aims to describe students' creative thinking process in solving mathematical problem. This study used descriptive qualitative method. The data were collected by using written test and interview. The test used six creative thinking questions that each two of them covered one of four indicators of mathematical creative thinking. The research subjects were five 8th grade students who have prior knowledge above the Minimum Mastery Criterion value taken from two research classes. The result shows that students can understand all the questions that indicate fluency, flexibility, and originality by read the questions repeatedly, write important information of questions on another paper, redraw, and imagine the problems situations in daily life. Students can give ideas well on fluency and originality questions by recall and carry out the knowledge but some students don't provide different solution on flexibility questions. Students do the illumination process well by show the ability to count and carry out well-generated ideas. Students can solve the problem by using the trial and error method in any situation. Furthermore, the verification process is carried out by do a recalculation, read the question to adjust the purpose of the problem, and use other strategies to have the same answer.

AB Pro-contra about concept mastery in STEM learning inspired this study to encounter conceptual change and STEM-project at the same time using R and D at different educational (junior, senior, university) levels. System thinking was chosen as medium to combine conceptual change and STEM learning, as it was found as part of Scientific Literacy in PISA and STEM approach, and as a UNESCO competency for Education for Sustainable Development. Groups of students from different levels of education were involved as research subjects. Certain consideration in choosing the biology topics and pre-posttests (concept mastery and system thinking skills) was administered for all level. Using system thinking oriented learning material it was reported that 7th graders can understand (plant & animal) cells structure well, no misconception for new concepts (prokaryote, plant tissue system), as they experience EDP in STEM-project and produce cell models. Conceptual change in high schools still resulted in misconception when the pre-post tests were taken once, but not for pre-post tests taken in each meeting. Topic choice and specific learning material for STEM based learning with system thinking oriented are very important to have complex system topic that enable to develop three types of system thinking.

AB The roof geometry is an important parameter in determining the natural cross-ventilation in buildings. Although many studies have been performed on natural ventilation, the impact of the large set of vaulted roofs on the building cross-ventilation remains to be addressed. In this paper, high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, validated with experimental data, are performed on five naturally ventilated buildings with two opposing windows, each with a specific type of vaulted roof and otherwise identical, in 0 degrees incident flow angle, to assess the impact of vaulted roof geometry on the building cross-ventilation performance. The following vault geometries are investigated and compared against a flat-roof building with the same specifications: (i) segmental, (ii) low-rise pointed, (iii) mid-rise catenary (iv) high-rise pointed and (v) high-rise catenary. The results show that compared to the flat-roof building, the vaulted roofs cause a <5% decrease in volume flow rate and 16-29% increase in the average mean velocity magnitude at the occupants' level. In vaulted buildings, the low-velocity regions of the flow are moved further away from the occupied zone towards the ceiling, thus providing a fresher air to the occupants. The results clarify the high potential of vaulted roofs for natural ventilation and sustainable design.

AB Pedestrian wind environment assessment is becoming an essential part of the urban design process especially in dense urban areas due to its ability to address the wind comfort/safety/health concerns in an early phase. In this paper, high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, validated with experimental data, are performed on eight different designs in a generic urban layout to study the impact of volume distribution on pedestrian wind environment in high-rise urban districts. The results show that the blockage effects of the highrise buildings decelerates the wind in the streets parallel to the flow while accelerating the flow in the streets perpendicular to the flow. This effect is evident up to a two block distance upstream of the high-rises. Furthermore, it is shown that consequent rows of high-rises in the downstream of the first row facing the wind flow have little effect on the upstream pedestrian wind; however, they have a significant role in the extent of affected areas downstream. The findings of this study provide further understanding about the impact of different volume distributions on pedestrian wind environment in high-rise urban districts and clarify their effect on wind safety and comfort.

AB We have developed a system using high-temperature radio frequency superconducting quantum interference device (RF-SQUID) for detecting metallic contaminants in the liquid component of a lithium-ion battery. Although we have executed detection experiments using a simulated system without liquid in the past ([1]), we have developed a new system to inspect real liquid components. Small cylindrical metallic contaminant samples were fabricated using a gallium-focused ion beam to evaluate the detection performance. Tap water containing the metallic contaminant sample was poured into the tube using a pump, and the magnetic signal of the contaminant matter was detected using the RF-SQUID. Among the tested small metallic contaminant samples, the volume of a minimum detectable metallic contaminant was evaluated to be 2 x 10(4) mu m(3), which corresponded to that of a spherical sample with a diameter of 33 mu m and a sensitivity of a signal-to-noise ratio of more than three. Moreover, the dependence of the detected signal strength on the volume of the metallic contaminant samples is discussed here.

AB The aerodynamic performance of building-integrated ducted wind turbines depends on several parameters such as the duct geometry, variation in wind speed and direction (which are inherent characteristics of the urban wind). This study focuses on the impact of wind direction on wind energy potential of a previously optimized building-integrated duct geometry [1], embedded in a generic isolated high-rise building. The mean power density at the duct throat (where the turbine can be installed) is investigated in four wind directions of theta = 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees. High-fidelity steady RANS simulations, validated with experimental data, are used. The results show that the studied duct can increase the mean power density at its throat (i.e. rotor plane) up to 7.08 - 24.8 times that of the freestream flow at the same height for a wide range of -60 degrees <= theta <= 60 degrees. The variation of wind energy potential in different wind directions is shown to be due to the increased size of the nozzle stagnation and separation regions for. > 0 degrees which limit the nozzle effective area and lower flowrate through the throat. Flow deviation from the duct central axis towards its walls further depletes the wind energy in friction.

ID SIMULATIONS; TURBINES; DESIGN
AB Extensive characterization studies are required to identify optimal wind farm layouts and achieve high power density, i.e., power per land area. Performing such studies using experimental or high-fidelity numerical methods can be timely and computationally expensive. To alleviate this obstacle, surrogate models can be developed to mimic the behavior of the simulation/experiment. In this paper, a shallow feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) surrogate model is developed. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is used to train a model with 3 layers and 10 hidden nodes. The model correlates the arrangement of a double-rotor vertical axis wind turbine array, as the fundamental generating cell of the wind farm, with its overall power performance. The inputs are the relative distance (R) and angle (Phi) between the rotors, and the output is the overall power coefficient of the array. In total, 96 CFD-simulated arrangements are used as data points to train, validate and test the model. The trained model has a mean square error of 2.10 x 10(-5) and R-squared of 0.99, indicating its accuracy and generalizability. The average and maximum errors are 3% and 10%, respectively. The employed method can be expanded to accommodate more rotors towards optimal urban wind farm layout design.

AB The discovery learning model is a learning model which can be implemented in the Curriculum 2013 in Indonesia. However, the student's learning outcomes of chemistry subject at SMAN 7 Palu using this learning model are not satisfactory because the students' scores have not passed the passing grade. Therefore, it is needed other learning model that has the characteristics of the scientific approach to be implemented. The purpose of this study is to see whether the application of the guided inquiry learning model based on the scientific approach in Fundamental Chemical Law topic can provide better learning outcomes for students in class X of SMA Negeri 7 Palu compared to the discovery learning model. The research method was a quasi-experimental study by conducting the experimental group and control groups. The results obtained by this study, to be precise the learning achievement data reached 92,1% to 96,05% in the experimental class 1 and 91.35% - 94.75% in the experimental class 2. While student's learning outcomes obtained an average of 56,48 and 46,25 with a standard deviation of 11,07 and 11,98. These values prove that the guided inquiry learning model to provide better learning outcomes compared to discovery learning. Furthermore, based on the two samples t-test results obtained, it was found that - t(table) < t(coun)> + t(table) (-1.68 < 2.99 > +1.68) with a significant level (alpha = 0.05) and degrees of freedom 41. Consequently, it can be inferred that the implementation of the guided inquiry learning model based on the scientific approach in the Fundamental Chemistry Law topic can provide better learning outcomes for class X students of SMA Negeri 7 Palu.

AB This study aimed to determine the composition of gold to silver minerals in rocks originating from Dongi-Dongi at 2 stations and to determine the composition of gold to silver minerals in rocks fixed to definite proportion. This study used secondary data, which were the result of rock analysis from Dongi-Dongi. The analysis showed that the gold composition from the three samples at Station 1 ranged from 0.01 to 0.99%, and the composition of silver ranged from 0.02 to1.46%. While the composition of gold at Station 2 ranged from 0.01 to 2.55%, and the composition of silver ranged from 0.07 to 3.02%. The results of the similarity analysis test of two variances and more than two variances showed that the composition of gold to silver has the same ratio in each sample, with F-count < F(table )then H-0 is accepted. Therefore, it can be concluded that the ratio of gold to silver in each sample is the same, and follows the Law of Definite Proportion as stated by Proust that a chemical compound consists of elements with a mass ratio always remains the same. In other words, each sample or compound has a fixed composition of elements.

AB Italy was the first country in Europe to enter lock-down due to COVID-19 pandemic. Most employees have been forced to adopt a work at home solution to avoid any possibility of spreading the virus. The article presents the results of a survey carried out in March-June 2020, during the first lockdown in Italy, aimed at investigating how people perceive the Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) of their households during working from home. The questionnaire consists in a general section reporting information about participant, households and rooms where they perform the working activities; a specific section reporting feedbacks on each IEQ aspects (thermal, visual comfort, air and acoustic quality), overall comfort, productivity and other external variables that can affect users' well-being during working hours. A total of 330 participants from all over the Italian territory signed the consent to participate in the survey over a period of about 3 months. The dataset was used to define the global level of satisfaction, perception, preference and interference with work at home, considering the main indoor environmental factors. The Machine Learning (ML) approach was applied to identify the most useful model to predict the overall comfort satisfaction.

AB Global energy demand has been increasing exponentially in the last three decades, which has been exacerbated by climate change. To alleviate the energy load, researchers have been exploring innovative passive techniques to enhance the thermal performance of building envelopes. This research evaluates a novel building envelope solution, which includes the development of a Concrete Masonry Unit that is integrated with bio-based micro-encapsulated Phase Changing Materials. The mechanical behaviour of the enhanced CMU is investigated to study the applicability of PCMs into the no-slump concrete mix. Compatibility with the applicable standards opens a broader prospect for thermal characterization and building performance simulations of PCM enhanced CMU building envelopes.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB We propose a model that aims to fulfill the following three necessities: the demand for refurbishing the existing built environment, the lack of a reliable means to help architects navigate among the numerous possible solutions for low-energy constructions, and the need for a multi-function tool to analyze buildings as complex systems. We introduce the Optimal Refurbishment Design (ORD) model that is a novel tool to help architects with the refurbishment of an existing building or the design of a new one. The ORD shows four innovative aspects. First, it opens the way to passive building design while focusing on affordable solutions. Second, its core component is based on mathematical optimization. Third, it simultaneously outputs optimal thermal mass and insulation of all the required elements in the building. Fourth, it automatically accounts for the user's needs and local regulations. Unlike most of the approaches in the Literature, the ORD's outputs are not limited by any pre-defined set of materials or strategies. We tested the ORD using a realistic study case of refurbishment, and found that the renovated house achieved the energy consumption of a Passive House by lowering its annual heating/cooling consumption by 23% with a payback period of less than 5 years.

AB Different types of skills are required to be able to remain competitive in 21st-century global developments, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of STEM project-based learning on students' motivation in learning heart transfer. The pre-experimental method with one group pretest post-test design was implemented. The sampling technique used in this study was convenience sampling. The samples of this study consist of 26 students who come from two different schools in 7th grade. Student's motivation is measured using the SMTSL questionnaire, and the data result analyzed using SPSS software. The result of this study showed that the implementation of STEM project-based learning gives an improvement in students' motivation significantly. Although N-gain values are 0.06, which categorized as low levels, the statistical test shows that there is a significant difference before and after the implementation of STEM project-based. According to this research, STEM project-based learning can be an alternative strategy to improve students' motivation towards science learning.

AB A timely identification of an anomalous functioning of the energy system of an industrial building would increase the efficiency and the resilience of the energy infrastructure, beside reducing the economic wastage. This work has been inspired by the need of identifying, for a series of supermarket buildings in Switzerland, the failures happening in their heating systems across the years in an unsupervised and easy-to-visualize fashion for the building managers. The lack of any a-priori label differentiating between typical and anomalous behaviors calls for the usage of unsupervised machine learning methods to extract the relevant features to describe the system operations, to reduce the dimension of the feature space, and to cluster together similar patterns of operations. The method is validated on a standard supermarket building, where it successfully discriminates winter and summer operations from periods of refurbishment or malfunctioning of the heating system.

AB Previous study at three leading high school in East Java have revealed that student's higher order thinking skills are good but their collaboration skills are still low. This study was aimed to reveal the effect of implementation the ASICC problem-based learning model on student's critical thinking and collaboration skills. The study included quasi-experimental research with a non-equivalent pre-post test control group design in second grade students in three leading high school in East Java. All instruments used are valid and reliable. Collaboration data that were normally and homogeneous were analyzed by t-test. The correlation between collaboration skills with critical thinking was analyzed with Pearson's correlation. This study revealed that there were significant differences in student's collaboration scores in the experimental and control classes. The ASICC class collaboration score is higher than the control class. There was a positive correlation between the ability of collaboration with critical thinking (r = 0.78). The ASICC learning model can be used as one of promising learning model to improve student collaboration skills and maintain critical thinking skills.

AB Time management skills cannot be released with student learning activities in project-based learning. The development of PjBL-based student worksheets is expected to not only empower higher-level thinking skills but also students' time management. This study aims to develop project-based learning worksheets. This research was conducted by using the Plomp design research consisting of preliminary, prototyping, and assessment phases. The results of this research revealed that both of critical thinking and creative thinking skills had increased (medium category) and it was have an impact on improving student time management with an effect size of 14,18 (very high). There was a positive correlation between HOTs with students' time management skill (r=0,82). Both of critical thinking and creative thinking were involving mental processes at each stage of project implementation so students must be able to manage their time well. This happens repeatedly and structured. Finally, the implementation of PjBL-based student's worksheet can improve student's higher-order thinking skills and time management skills.

AB The NEWA ALEX17 experiment was conducted with the objective of characterizing the wind conditions upstream of the Alaiz Test Site for the validation of flow models. From the intensive operational period, a case study has been selected for a Wakebench benchmark consisting of four consecutive days with relatively persistent winds from the North. The validation is centered around a 118-m mast at the Alaiz site and six additional masts located along the valley and at the lee side of a ridge delimiting a 8-km long area of interest. The benchmark is a follow-up of the GABLS3 diurnal cycle benchmark in flat terrain to test mesoscale-to-microscale transient and steady-state modeling methodologies in the assessment of stability-dependent bin-averaged wind conditions. Meso-micro methodologies reduce the wind speed mean bias from 32%, at 3-km mesoscale, to +/- 5%. Beyond mean bias mitigation, these initial results demonstrate the added value of meso-micro coupling at reproducing non conventional wind conditions at the test site like high-shear low-level jets in stable conditions and negative wind shear in unstable conditions. The benchmark also discusses the challenges of each meso-micro methodology going forward.

AB The problem frequently encountered in physics practicum activities is measuring instruments in limited reading data variable time of dynamic moving objects. In practical exercises needed the accuracy of measurement data to avoid a mistake in analysis and interpretation data. R-TDA of Dynamic Moving Objects measurement tool is expected to be a solution to overcome these problems. The electronic components used are Infra-Red Obstacle Sensor, connector cable, NodeMCU. The principle of this device is to send a recording time of modulo infrared to the cloud server and accessed via a smartphone and Personal Computer. The results show the sensor a responsive time of 6.8 x 10-11 seconds, and the effect of gravity acceleration of 9,70 m/s2 close to universal gravity acceleration 9,81 m/s2 with an average relative error of 1.22%. The R-TDA of Dynamic Moving Objects has a high response time and accuracy in recording the time of dynamic moving objects.

AB This research was conducted to compare the temperature and humidity data presented by the BMKG against realtime data based on the DHT11 sensor readings in Kedunggalar, Ngawi. Data was collected for 14 days (8-21 September 2020) at the same time interval between 07-10 AM according to the data update on the BMKG website. Temperature and humidity readings are recorded periodically with the DHT11 sensor every second for one minute, so that 60 data generated every one day. The average temperature and humidity data produced by the DHT11 sensor is 29.18 degrees C and 68.16% with a comparison of the average data from the BMKG website 28.79 degrees C and 65.36%. So that from the comparison of direct measurements of DHT11 and from the website it has a sensor reading error against a temperature of 1.59 degrees C and a humidity of 5.24%. The conclusion is that the measurement of temperature and humidity in Kedunggalar with the DHT11 sensor is very valid against the data on the BMKG website. Even though the humidity exceeds the accuracy limit of the DHT11 sensor which is a maximum tolerance value of 5%, on the other hand the temperature reading is very accurate because the tolerance value is less than 2 degrees C.

AB The purpose of this study is to equip students with ESD competencies of systemic thinking and problem-solving in the topic of environmental change. The weak experimental method with the one-group pretest-posttest design was used for this study. Twenty-nine students were selected by purposive sampling in grade X Public High School I Bandung. Data was collected through instruments written tests. Each test was arranged based on the indicator of systemic thinking and problem-solving that have integrated with the aspect of ESD (social, environment, and economy). Data was tested by N-Gain. Based on the results of the N-Gain category on student systemic thinking ability were high (0%), medium (48.27%), and low (51.72%). And then, the results of the N-Gain category on student problem-solving ability were high (0%), medium (72.41%), and low (27.58%). The result test of pretest-posttest scores of students' systemic thinking ability showed an average of 69.13 and 80.03. Then, the result test of pretest-posttest scores of students' problem-solving ability showed an average of 61.48 and 79.03. It can be concluded that the effort to implement ESD in Biology learning was quite successful in equipping students' thinking systems and problem- solving skills.

AB Covid-19 is a global emergency epidemic that affect all areas of life including the economy. Growth in the world economy has decreased due to lack of purchasing power that lasts for only at home policy. This policy is carried out to prevent the spread of covid-19, which on the other hand actually increases the use of e-commerce and mobile commerce as means of shopping. The use of e-commerce and mobile commerce is considered capable of helping consumers to buy basic necessities and health that are needed during activities at home. Buying and selling transaction through e-commerce and mobile commerce have increases during covid-19. Which is then utilized by e-commerce and mobile commerce by providing various attractive offers for consumers. The consumer does not need to interact with the seller and the items needed will be sent home.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB In line with the development of information systems and technology today, which has entered the era of the industrial revolution 4.0, the learning process in high schools also develops by utilizing information systems and information technology platforms by developing electronic learning systems or often called e-learning. For the successful implementation of e-learning, it is important to know what factors and indicators can be used to build a performance evaluation model., so that the implementation strategy can be determined in a future that is sustainable and superior in competition. The method used to process data is a factor analysis method, whereas to construct an evaluation model of a number of factors obtained, the regression model is used. The results of the analysis produced 5 (five) new factors, namely a culture of change, a knowledge management system, the latest information, the dissemination of knowledge, and the development of teaching materials.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB The spread of the 2019 Corona virus Disease pandemic (Covid-19) resulted in many organizational entities being forced to redesign business processes, reducing the cost of reducing working hours, to terminating employment (layoffs). The informal sector has the worst impact. Thus, both the government and the private sector make various efforts in overcoming problems of social impact that arise. One of them is through the formation of the Task Force for the Acceleration of Handling Covid19 (covid19.go.id ) as a single contact crisis center. However, the extent of the impact that arises will result in preventive, curative and promotive efforts at risk of not being handled properly. The implementation of knowledge management based on graphs (knowledge graph) will enable agile integration between various sources of information. The Graph Data Model captures the relationships of various different entities by connecting them through the edge of information extracted from various heterogeneous sources. After the data is represented in a graphical format, there are various analytic graph techniques for asking multi-hop (multi-node) relationships between entities in the knowledge graph that is built. In addition, graphs allow users to visualize data quickly, interactively and exploratively for analysis.

AB Marginal land development in Situbondo Regency has not yet received special attention from farmer as the farmer-enterpreneur, so that the efforts made by stakeholders have not yet gotten maximum results. Therefore, increasing awareness and understanding of the development and use of marginal area is needed. The objectives of this study are: 1) knowing the land characteristics of crops commodities at marginal land and (2) mapping the suitability of cropland at marginal land. The locations of the study are Jatibanteng and Sumbermalang Subdistricts with the consideration that the subdistrict is the area where the majority of rice fields are dry and marginal area in Situbondo Regency. The research method uses an analytical approach The data collection method is using secondary data, which is available statistical data that has been published by BPS and primer data. The data analysis method uses SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) and soil chemical analysis. The results showed that of (1) the land characteristics can be seen from soil chemical analysis including: a) Phosfor content of land ranged from 28,06-84,28 me/100g which was dominated by high status; b) Potassium value of land ranged from 16.95-59.96 me/100g which was dominated by moderate status; c) Organic matter content of land ranged from 1.75-3.39% which was dominated by medium status; d) Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) value of land ranged from 14.76 - 37.03 me/100g which was dominated by the high status; and e) Base Saturation in Jatibanteng Subdistrict was classified as low to moderate, ranged from 30.39% - 50.10% and Sumbermalang subdistrict ranged from 20.15% - 48.62%. Provision of organic material is a way that can be applied to increase the value of BS, because organic matter affects soil properties such as its physics and chemistry. (2) Meanwhile the the second objective was found that: a) around 35% of Jatibanteng Subdistrict was in the S1 (Highly Suitable) category; on the other hand, Sumbermalang Subdistricts was in the S2 (Moderately Suitable) and S3 (Marginal Suitable) categories for the rice field suitability, b) class suitability of corn in the study area was included in the more dominant of S2 (Moderately Suitable) category reaching almost 85% of the land areas, and c) cassava plants had an S1 (Highly Suitable) suitability class dominated by Jatibanteng Subdistrict which was almost 50% of its areas in Sumbermalang Subdistrict with the suitability of S2 (Moderately Suitable) and S1 (Highly Suitable).

AB To prevent undercooling of the ground in densely populated areas, regeneration of borehole heat exchangers (BHEs), for example by solar thermal heat, may become necessary. However, the usable roof area is often small compared to the building's heat demand, especially in urban areas. It was investigated how much regeneration is possible in districts that are supplied entirely by heat pumps with BHEs. Example buildings were modelled based on the buildings of two districts in Zurich. Uncovered PVT collectors and glazed flat-plate collectors were used as regeneration sources. The possible regeneration was determined in a simulation process that included the effects of mutual influences between the BHEs of neighbouring buildings. As expected, glazed flat-plate collectors allow for more regeneration than uncovered PVT collectors. For full regeneration, the required usable roof area relative to the annual heat demand is about 1.8m(2)/MWh for PVT and 1.2m(2)/MWh for flat-plate collectors. Large buildings often do not provide sufficient roof area for full regeneration. A sustainable heat supply of the entire district with regenerated BHEs can be possible in suburban neighbourhoods, if the bigger buildings are distributed rather evenly. In urban neighbourhoods, areas may exist in which solar thermal regeneration alone is not sufficient.

AB A coordinated operation of decentralised micro-scale hybrid energy systems within a locally managed network such as a district or neighbourhood will play a significant role in the sector-coupled energy grid of the future. A quantitative analysis of the effects of the primary energy factors, energy conversion efficiencies, load profiles, and control strategies on their energy-economic balance can aid in identifying important trends concerning their deployment within such a network. In this contribution, an analysis of the operational data from five energy laboratories in the trinational Upper-Rhine region is evaluated and a comparison to a conventional reference system is presented. Ten exemplary data-sets representing typical operation conditions for the laboratories in different seasons and the latest information on their national energy strategies are used to evaluate the primary energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and demand-related costs. Various conclusions on the ecologic and economic feasibility of hybrid building energy systems are drawn to provide a toe-hold to the engineering community in their planning and development.

AB One of the promising methods for increasing the resistance of polymer composite materials to high-speed impact is the use of protective shockproof coatings. At the same time, over the past two decades, polyurea have been gaining noticeable popularity among such coatings. This work is devoted to study the effect of polyurea coating of 1.2 mm thickness on ballistic resistance characteristics of glass-fibre reinforced layered polymer of 8.5 mm thickness. During the experiments thirteen composite targets was affected by high-speed impact loading in the range of 80.150 m/s by spherical steel projectile of 23.8 mm diameter. It was shown that using the polyurea coating can increase the ballistic limit by 19% increasing the mass of the target only by 7%. Dynamic strain and displacement fields on the back surface of the target was obtained using digital image correlation method for 81.2 m/s collision process.

AB Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) facades are a solution to consider when it comes to electricity generation on the building site. One of the main challenges attributes to this technology is finding the best trade-off between the electrical efficiency of BIPVs and the energy use of the building. This study aims to identify a scenario that yields the optimized results for electrical and thermal performance in a test building. Among the scenarios, the original wooden cladding in the test building is either replaced with PV panels or the PV modules are added to the existing facade. Rhinoceros 3D CAD software and its visual programming plugin Grasshopper are used to perform various simulations for both east-oriented and west-oriented facades with low and high thermal inertia wall structures. Although a complex flow phenomenon behind BIPVs is simplified in the 3D heat transfer model, relatively reliable results are obtained using the chosen simulation tool. It is observed that the east-faced BIPV facade in the test building has higher electrical efficiency. This could be attributed to the lower inertia of the east wall that allows easier propagation of heat through the structure.

AB In this paper a design concept and a finite element analysis of a combined electromagnetic/piezoelectric scalable hybrid energy harvesting device is presented, which converts mechanical energy from low frequency rotations into electrical energy. The electromagnetic (EM) transducer comprises an electric coil and a permanent magnet which is moved by the changing gravitation force vector caused by the rotational movement. The piezoelectric (PE) transducer is based on a vibrational energy harvester excited through magnetic plugging, which is induced by the movement of the permanent magnet of the EM harvester. As the magnetic plugging mechanism acts as a frequency-up conversion the device can be used in a wide range of rotational frequencies. The performance of both transducers is evaluated by finite element simulations to estimate the output power.

AB Wake steering has an impact on both the wind farm energy yield and turbine loads. We evaluate these effects based on yaw-corrected power and thrust curves and tabulated turbine load simulation results. In a first step, wind direction and wind speed dependent yaw angles were determined by maximization of the wind farm power for an example wind farm. Secondly, the optimizations were repeated for the objective of minimal flapwise blade fatigue loads. The results were then combined such that the power optimized yaw angles dominate the partial load region while the load optimized results were chosen for higher wind speeds. We find that this combination increases the annual energy production in an example wind rose while simultaneously reducing the lifetime damage equivalent loads. The analysis was repeated including wind direction uncertainty into the optimization. This significantly reduced the benefit of wake steering on AEP but caused only a mild decrease of the overall load reduction.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB HVAC systems are among the biggest energy consumers in buildings and therefore in the focus of optimal control research. In practice, rule-based control and PID controllers are typically used and implemented at the beginning of the building operation. Since this approach neither guarantees optimal or even good control, optimal control algorithms (which can be predictive and adaptive) are in the focus of research. The problem with most of the approaches is that a model of the system is often needed which comes with high engineering efforts. Further, the required computing power can quickly exceed the capacities, even in modern buildings. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the application of a state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, as a self-calibrating valve controller for two water-air heat exchangers of a real-world air handling unit. We choose a generic problem formulation to pre-train the algorithm with a simulation of an admixing heater and use it to control an injection heater and a throttle cooler. Our results show that after only 70 hours, the control quality significantly increases. Therefore, it seems evident that with pre-trained RL algorithms, a self-improving HVAC automation can be realized with little hardware requirements and without extensive modelling of the system dynamics.

AB We present results from an experimental investigation of two closely spaced helical vortices. The two co-rotating vortices are generated in a water channel by a one-bladed rotor, whose tip geometry is modified by the addition of a perpendicular fin on the pressure side. The fin parameters are tuned so that the two vortices have approximately equal circulation. Dye visualisations and flow field measurements from Particle Image Velocimetry show that the vortices merge into a single tip vortex within less than one rotor rotation. This fast merging is caused by a rapid increase of the core radii of the initial vortices, which indicates the presence of an instability phenomenon. Analysis of the vortex velocity profiles identifies it as a centrifugal instability, linked to the presence of opposite-signed vorticity in the blade tip region. We further explore the origin of this vorticity by modifying the streamwise fin position. Measurements suggest that the interaction between the secondary fin vortex and the blade surface is partly responsible for the generation of the unstable velocity profile. The vortex resulting from the merging has a significantly larger core size than the one developing without a fin, indicating that this configuration could be beneficial in the context of Blade-Vortex Interaction noise for helicopters, or for the reduction of fatigue loads on wind turbine rotors caused by the interaction with concentrated tip vortices in the wake of upstream turbines.

AB Two-bladed turbines might be an alternative for future offshore wind turbine installations due to the promising opportunity to be more economical compared to three-bladed turbines. Looking at the rotor blades, two-bladed turbines with a comparable design either rotate 22.5% faster or have up to 50% increased chord lengths. The latter result in a significantly higher second moment of area, which enables rotor mass savings and thus fewer costs while withstanding similar to 50% higher flapwise loads per blade. Unfortunately, such a design could also cause buckling issues. increasing the design tip speed reduces stability issues but lowers the rotor mass savings. Consequently, the challenging task is to find an optimal compromise between preventing buckling and saving rotor mass, and thus to ensure a fair comparison of two- and three-bladed turbines' blades. To overcome this challenge, a procedure for redesigning a comparable blade structure is introduced. The procedure is exemplarily demonstrated for large 20 MW offshore wind turbines. Compared to the three-bladed reference, the overall rotor mass reduction of the two-bladed turbine is 13.5% for the most beneficial compromise detected. Simultaneously, the blades showing good accordance with the reference concerning static stresses and buckling characteristics under their respective loads.

AB Immersive virtual reality offers a wide range of applications. Immersive virtual reality in particular can play an important role in lighting design, thanks to its ability to allow a quick assessment between different design choices based on spaces, colours and light. However, immersive virtual reality has to guarantee a correct reproduction of light behaviour from photometric and visual points of view, in order to be effectively used for lighting analysis. This paper presents a literature review aimed to analyse the activities of the research groups operating in this field that have addressed, with different approaches and points of view, the issue of iVR applications in the reproduction of environments illuminated by either daylight or electric lighting, as well as a combination of them.

AB Indonesia is one of the countries whose people are most affected by the 2019 corona virus (COVID-19). When the corona virus spreads faster, the Indonesian government imposed large-scale social restrictions in big cities to villages in Indonesia. With the changing situation in carrying out work activities during this pandemic, it will certainly affect the quality of organization in companies and the quality of education in schools and colleges. In order to identify all processes in teaching and learning activities that are running well or not, schools need to monitor and measure employee performance. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are generally used as benchmarks to determine how well a company's performance can be represented by employee performance. In this study, the key performance indicator preparation process was carried out through the stages of designing a questionnaire, distributing questionnaires to employees in educational institutions, conducting factor analysis and then developing a KPI model. The output is in the form of a KPI model that can be used as a reference in the formation of KPIs in educational institutions, namely Y = 5,360 + 1,380 X1 -1,068 X3.

AB The building construction industry is adapting Additive Manufacturing (AM) and robotic fabrication techniques to, among other efficiency and cost benefits, reduce the lifecycle Green House Gas (GHG) emissions of new buildings. This research aims to fabricate a low-GHG emission facade by encoding environmental performance using a combination of material selection, AM techniques, and bespoke geometry. This paper presents the design methodology, specifically the response to solar radiation (i.e. shading and daylight transmission). The key contribution of this publication is establishing the digital fabrication process of AM facades: beginning with performative parametric design, using empirical Bi-directional Scattering Distribution Function (BSDF) data of AM thermoplastic elements for daylight simulation to assess performance, and finally optimising the topology for a specific context (location and orientation).

AB Unsteady frequency response of in-plane electro-thermal MEMS-based cantilever sensors can cause up-/down-shifting of the resonance phase, which becomes an inhibitive factor in resonance locking using a phase-locked loop setup. Moreover, the inconsistency of resonance phase during real-time measurement potentially causes inaccuracy in resonant-frequency locking. In this work, reference parameters are differentially subtracted from the sensor output signals to enhance the characteristic of frequency response. As a calculation result, a constant resonance phase can be successfully achieved by adjusting the reference parameters close to the sensor baseline, both in sensor amplitude and phase.

AB The purpose of this study was to obtain the impact of using Electronic Conceptual Development Conceptual Change Text (E-CDCCText) related to the concept of acceleration of free-falling objects on K-10 students. E-CDCCText consists of seven parts. The third part is a conceptual development text. The fourth, fifth, and sixth parts are conceptual change text added with cognitive conflict and scientific explanation. The method used is pre-experiment with one group of three test designs. Research subjects were 32 K-10 students whose average age is 1415 years old, consisting of 20 female and 12 male students in Yogyakarta. The research subjects were selected by random sampling techniques for the class. Data is collected based on parallel conception tests in the four-tier test format on the free-falling objects acceleration concept. These results indicate that E-CDCCText has high effectiveness in remediating misconceptions. In general, the use of E-CDCCText has been effective in facilitating the conceptual progression of students in the type of well progression (75%). The use of E-CDCCText does not cause gender bias between female and male students.

AB The dynamics of some magnetic fluid (MF) samples of various concentrations filling the tube horizontally and held by a field of a magnetic axial system made based on unipolar permanent rare-earth ring magnets were studied. The magnetic field of an "axial" magnetic system of MSO was studied, as well as the dependence of the system oscillation frequency on the length of the MF cylinder. An original method for determining MF magnetization is proposed and applied to the obtained data. Magnetization was determined for three magnetic fluid samples. The results obtained by the developed method are comparable to the magnetization values obtained by the ballistic method. The developed and presented technique of a dynamic experiment with measuring oscillations frequency of the "MF column suspended in a strong and inhomogeneous magnetic field" system involves the creation of a new absolute method for determining saturation magnetization and can be useful for studying magnetophoresis and aggregation processes of magnetic nanoparticles. This technique is used to study the degree of elastomagnetic consistency parameters over time.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has forced schools to make a shift in learning mode, from face to face become online remote learning. This is also faced and done by chemistry teachers. The study was conducted to investigate the response of chemistry teachers to online learning in the COVID-19 pandemic. A purposive survey method was used in this study by giving online questionnaires through Google form containing 10 open questions about chemistry learning and practicum conducted by the chemistry teachers in the COVID-19 pandemic. The data were collected for a week at the beginning of June 2020. A total of 55 chemistry teachers from West Java participated as respondents. The result found that chemistry teachers had tried to utilize various technology platforms in conducting learning. Moreover, most of them faced difficulty to arrange the lab-work activities and did nothing. Some teachers try to find lab-work multimedia instead of real activities. However, the multimedia commonly did not make students pertain the processes skills. Since the pandemic could not be predicted when it will finish, this is a kind of challenges and opportunities to think about implementing online chemistry learning from now and then.

AB The design of plug-in wire system is improved for 200-pixel superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) array of X-ray detector on a helium three cryostat. The electrical connections between the STJ array to the room temperature electronics consists of plural wire modules, which have connectors at the both ends. A flexible coaxial cable with electrical conductors of stainless steel (SUS-FFC) is manufactured and attached to make the electrical connection between room temperature to the 3 K stage. After the installation of SUS-FFC, temperature of the cold stage is 302 mK, and the holding time is more than 115 hours. Compared with the previous setup, the temperature of 3He stage decreased 5 mK, and the holding time increased 30 hours.

ID CONSUMPTION; SECTOR
AB Energy-related household consumption lead to a substantial share of the total household GHG emissions (direct and indirect). The policies or technologies, which try to mitigate these emissions often end up 'rebounding' i.e. the savings of energy (bills) caused by these measures, induce further expenses in other (e.g. travel) or same (e.g. electricity) categories, leading to (partial) offsetting of the emissions saving. This research introduces application of a data-driven bottom up method to evaluate these rebound emissions based on the household consumption (expenses) and properties. Two scenarios of energy-savings measures are evaluated here: (1) switching to energy-efficient devices, and (2) switching to renewable energy. The results are discussed for households with varying income, region of residence and household size. The results show that higher income and bigger households have higher total rebounds for both scenarios, while Zurich has lowest compared to all other Swiss regions.

AB The current-biased kinetic-inductance detector (CB-KID) is a solid-state superconducting neutron detector with high spatial and temporal resolutions, and multi-hit tolerance. We demonstrate high temperature operation of CB-KID at 7.9K with the delay-line method. High temperature operation reduces imaging pixel size by suppressing signal propagation velocity. High spatial neutron transmission image for a mixed metal alloy consisting of heavy elements Sm and Sn is successfully constructed. We also examine the capability of element discrimination imaging based on the resonance dip analysis.

ID THERMOCAPILLARY FLOW; SOLUBLE SURFACTANTS; CONTAMINATION; VELOCITIES
AB The results of the flow structure visualization experiments conducted on the surface of a single bubble streamlined by uniform flow are presented. It is shown that, at certain critical values for bubble size, flow velocity, and contamination level, the axial symmetry of the surface flow loses its stability in a threshold manner, and the first instability mode in the form of two vortices appears. Below the threshold, the stationary flow on the bubble surface is impossible. The experimental results indicate that the assumption about the axial symmetry of the motion on the bubble surface containing surfactants, which is used in most theoretical and numerical studies, is invalid. Analysis of the results has revealed the most likely reason for the spiral form of the trajectory in the problem of a small rising bubble in the surrounding fluid. For the surfactant-free surface realized in the experiments with isopropyl alcohol, the rising trajectory was a straight line, and no vortex structures were observed on the bubble surface. In the experiments with water, a spiral rising trajectory was observed, and the first instability mode was formed on the bubble surface.

AB Brown sugar is one of the traditional artificial sweeteners that is widely used by Indonesian people. Unfortunately, society considers that the brown sugar-making process is only a step of unscientific traditions and habits. This research aims to explore the physical concepts of heat transfer in making traditional brown sugar. Data were gathered through interviews, documentation, and observation. Analysis of the data used is descriptive qualitative with triangulation techniques. This research represented that brown sugar manufacturing contains heat transfer processes of conduction, convection, and radiation in the Ndewan processes. The conduction process occurred in the furnace (heat source), which propagates in the pan during the heating process, and the convection process happened when the palm sap is heated. Also, the radiation process transpired around the furnace. This study is expected as alternative teaching material in the learning physics class to be more contextual.

AB Acquired defects of the maxillofacial region require orthopedic treatment. When choosing a structural material for the manufacture of a jaw prosthesis, it is necessary to provide for functional loads on the prosthesis during operation. Defects in the jaw bones require a structural material with high strength characteristics. The article deals with the method of increasing the strength of polyamide dental material with nanoscale titanium dioxide. Objective: to improve the strength characteristics of orthopedic structures made of polyamide. The study of the polyamide material was carried out on control and experimental samples, in which a modifying component was introduced by the method of dispersion reinforcement - nanoscale titanium dioxide in an amount of up to 1 wt.%. The three-point bending strength (sigma max, MPa) and Young's modulus (E, MPa) were experimentally studied. These criteria are indicative when assessing the strength of the basic structural materials from which removable dentures are made. These parameters take into account both vertical and horizontal functional loads, similar to the forces that arise when using removable dentures. The results of the study showed an increase in the maximum voltage by 8.4%, and the Jung module by 7.2% in samples with nanoscale titanium dioxide introduced into their composition to 1 wt. %. This study is of practical importance for orthopedic dentistry in cases where it is necessary to strengthen the structural base material in the manufacture of jaw prostheses for patients with acquired defects of the jaw bones, which reduces the risk of fracture of the base structures under the influence of functional loads.

AB The aim of this research is to quantify the impact of heating set point on space heating energy demand for a typical UK dwelling. Retrofit includes fabric energy efficiency improvements. Energy performance certificates (EPCs) inform the householder of typical savings per measure, but this has previously been found to inaccurately estimate space heating energy demand, leading to errors in 'typical savings' presented to householders. The most sensitive inputs have been found to be temperature set point, followed by fabric efficiency. The BREDEM methodology assumes a temperature of 21 degrees C for nine hours a day, rather than similar to 16 degrees C and similar to 20 degrees C found in research. The methods used to inform this study are local sensitivity analysis of the domestic energy model, based on a typical dwelling example with calibrated inputs. This is done using an open calibrated Python model, based on BREDEM. The impact of heating patterns on space heating energy demand are modelled pre retrofit; according to differing heating set points, following wall and loft fabric upgrade and full fabric upgrade. The BREDEM heating set point assumptions lead to space heating energy demand predicted similar to 50-100 kWh/m(2)/yr higher than real heating set points. Implications for retrofit design and EPCs are discussed.

AB The microstructural analysis of tissues plays a crucial role in the early detection of abnormal tissue morphology. Polarization microscopy, an optical tool for studying the anisotropic properties of biomolecules, can distinguish normal and malignant tissue features even in the absence of exogenous labelling. To facilitate the quantitative analysis, we developed a polarization-sensitive label-free imaging system based on the Stokes-Mueller calculus. Polarization images of ductal carcinoma tissue samples were obtained using various input polarization states and Stokes-Mueller images were reconstructed using Matlab software. Further, polarization properties, such as degree of linear and circular polarization and anisotropy, were reconstructed from the Stokes images. The Mueller matrix obtained was decomposed using the Lu-Chipman decomposition method to acquire the individual polarization properties of the sample, such as depolarization, diattenuation and retardance. By using the statistical parameters obtained from the polarization images, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was trained to facilitate the tissue classification associated with its pathological condition.

AB The problem faced in classroom learning was rarely a learning activity that was able to improve creative thinking skills consistently. Therefore, one of the alternatives to the learning activity that could be used as a tool for improving the basic skills needed in this century in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. This study aimed to describe the effectiveness of the STEM learning model in improving the creative thinking skills of students. It was a quasi-experimental research with Posttest-Only Design with Nonequivalent Groups. Based on data analysis, there was an effect of STEM education on students' creative thinking skills. Based on the research results obtained from students' creativity varies between low and moderate and the answers to the creativity tests given show lower results than expected. STEM can be recommended as an alternative and approach in learning biology, especially in improving students' creative thinking abilities. Creative thinking is important to everyone, because to proof of the truth of the formulation of an assessment can be encouraged by way of thinking.

AB The integration of STEM education in all fields can contribute to the economic and educational development of a nation. In today's global age, all countries around the world need to integrate STEM education into school curricula to foster STEM students' interest from elementary education to college. The purpose of this study was to test the impact of STEM interest based on family background for secondary students. This study conducted a quantitative paradigm involving 150 secondary students. the results show that there is a STEM interest based on family background. In addition, STEM interest is strongly influenced by student gender. The findings of this study provide implications for teachers and school curriculum makers that students 'interest in STEM subjects is influenced by students' family background and gender. Future researchers need to delve deeper into the factors that influence students on STEM subjects based on student attitude, achievement, and socioeconomic status.

AB High-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnetic levitation (maglev) systems have been studied by various research groups regarding both experimental and modelling point of view. However, there exists a trade-off between levitation and guidance forces acting on the vehicle, especially in the case of high-speed curve negotiation. To overcome this trade-off, we proposed a multi-surface permanent magnet guideway (PMG) design, for the small-scale maglev vehicle, in which polarization of the permanent magnets (PM) changing with track segments. The HTS-PM interaction model was constructed by utilizing H-formulation implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics (R). The hysteretic levitation and guiding force expressions used in the dynamic simulation have been obtained by a polynomial fit to force-displacement curves obtained by the finite element model built in COMSOL Multiphysics (R) environment. Also, the damping effect derived from free-fall dynamic tests is incorporated into the model to construct a more realistic simulation model. The effectiveness of the proposed track design has been validated through comparisons with Halbach-derived PMG. Finally, it can be thought that the proposed PMG design is a good candidate for the high-speed operation of a maglev system when the increased levitation and guiding stiffness values are considered.

AB The power system is experiencing an increasing share of renewable and intermittent energy production and increasing electrification. However, these changes are creating high power peaks, are straining the grid and call for expensive investments in expansions and improvements. This paper examines how the operational strategy of shared battery energy storage systems (s-BESS) can address these issues for commercial buildings with relatively high power peaks. Due to the uncertainty in long-term costs when subject to a measured peak (MP) grid tariff, the scheduling of the battery is optimised with a receding horizon control algorithm. The optimisation model is used on a Norwegian real-life case study to find the best possible configuration with an already existing battery. Although current Norwegian regulations challenge the possibility for shared metering and billing for a s-BESS configuration, the results show that the total system cost was reduced by 19.2% compared to no battery. The community peak was reduced by 17.8% compared to no battery and 6.22-17.5% compared to individual storage, which indicates that s-BESS is of value for the DSO as well.

AB This study aims to determine the profile of evaluative thinking skills (ETs) of Chemical education pre-service teacher on the theme of carbohydrates in food chemistry (FC). The research method used was descriptive qualitative with a research sample of 31 students from 2013, 2014 and 2015 who have attended FC lectures in one of the Chemical Education department in South Sumatra. The instrument used was a test of ETs totaling 4 questions that had been validated. Indicators of ETs to be achieved include 1) Asking questions. 2) Seek deeper understanding through reflection and perspective, and 3) Making informed decisions in preparation for action. The results showed the profile of students' ETs on theme carbohydrates in FC lectures showed that the average student ETs were classified as low. Generally, students have demonstrated skills in asking questions adequately, but still show weaknesses in reflecting and perspective thinking. Likewise decision-making skills also need to be improved. ETs are needed so that students are able to do self-evaluation and introspect their own weaknesses to be able to think more forward.

AB This work analyses the accuracy of large-scale experimental testing procedure in ocean basin facility involving real-time hybrid model testing (ReaTHM) techniques. The analysis is based on a scaled concept for a 15MW floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) supported by a concrete semi-submersible platform (ActiveFloat) developed within the framework of the project COREWIND. The real-time hybrid model considered includes a multi-fan system located at the aero-rotor interface, which permits to generate the aerodynamic loads, reducing the limitations typically given by scaled problems. In order to assess the uncertainties in the hardware in the loop (HIL) implementation, firstly we define the quantities of interest to be evaluated from all the possible sources liable to inaccuracy identified. Then, we quantify the systematic and random discrepancies of the selected mooring, platform and HIL parameters. Finally, we propagate the previously quantified errors, running simulations in OpenFAST under extremal and severe environmental load cases in Gran Canaria Island (Spain) site. Comparing the platform response and mooring tensions of these uncertainty propagations with the ones of the unperturbed simulation as a baseline case, we analyse the effect of each representative parameter. Thus, the reliability of the results in ocean basin testing is numerically assessed, depending on the design load case.

AB Thermal convection of dehumidified air is studied experimentally under conditions close to normal (atmospheric pressure approximate to 740 mm Hg, temperature range T = 0 ... 50 C). The study is based on fundamental experiment, which is focused on the physical aspects of thermoconcentration convection in fluids, undergoing first-order phase transitions of the "gas-liquid" type. The peculiar features of convection, caused by concentration changes of water vapor (as a result of its evaporation or condensation), are discussed in terms of dimensionless parameters. The couple of standard complementary experimental methods are used: holographic interferometry for visualization of convective flows and thermocouple method for heat flux measurements. Test experiments demonstrate and approve the design characteristics of the setup. The observations of convective flows in dehumidified air are demonstrated. Experimental setup is described in all details, including the original design of the cold heat exchanger (resembling a heat tube), proposed for next experiments with humid air.

AB A minimalistic model complex for determining the available wind power and associated costs related to the development of large-scale offshore wind power was recently developed by Sorensen and Larsen [1]. The model complex demands only a few global input parameters, such as turbine rotor diameter, nameplate capacity, area of wind farm, number of turbines, water depth, and mean wind speed Weibull parameters for the site. Using actual wind climate and bathymetric data for the North Sea, the model is in the present work used to map the annual energy production and levelized cost of energy (LCoE) for wind farms located in the North Sea. As a main conclusion, exploiting all locations with water depths down to about 45 m comply with the electrical power demand of Europe, which is about 3500 TWh/year. In this case, the LCoE is found to be about 7 (sic)cents/kWh for wind farms consisting of 15 MW wind turbines and an interspacing between the wind turbines of 8 diameter, corresponding to 2 km.

AB A novel method is introduced to determine the long-term extreme value distribution of variables with an associated short-term distribution. The method is applicable to e.g. the extreme value with a return period of 10.000 years for wave height, crest height of waves as well as wave-induced response and loads on offshore wind turbine monopiles. The extreme values are determined by a combination of a joint probabilistic description of the met-ocean environment and of a recently developed database of fully nonlinear wave kinematics computations. For two benchmark monopile structures, representative for the conditions at Dogger Bank and the German Bight in the North Sea, the one-hour max value of crest height, inline force and overturning moment are computed via the Rainey slender-body force model. Convolution with the joint probability of the sea state parameters in the nondimensional space of wave steepness and Ursell parameter leads to the marginal probability distribution for these parameters up to a 10.000 year return period and properly accounts for the uncertainty of the extreme value parameters in also the short-term distributions. It is found that the best extreme value fit is generally obtained with a third-order polynomial fit within the space of steepness and Ursell parameter. Compared to the Forristall crest height distribution, the inclusion of full nonlinearity leads to larger crest heights at low return period levels. However, due to its realistic treatment of the breaking limitation, lower crests are predicted at the 10.000 year level for the two positions considered in the North Sea. With further verification of the wave kinematics in combination with load models and a thorough comparison to present engineering practice, the proposed methodology provides a robust future solution for directly estimating extreme value distributions of loads and response of offshore wind turbine monopiles.

AB The laser-related activities are reviewed of the Biophotonics Laboratory at UL Institute of Atomic Physics and Spectroscopy following the previous ICSQE-2018 conference. Four recent research projects are considered, including one EC Horizon-2020 project, two European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) projects and one project funded by the Latvian Council of Science (LCS). The projects are generally aimed at developing new optical methods and technologies for non-invasive in-vivo skin assessment to facilitate the early diagnostics of skin malformations (including cancers). Most of the projects explore novel approaches of camera-based biomedical imaging to the clinical diagnostics and recovery monitoring.

AB The introduction of new upconverting nanoparticles (UPCNPs) in the tumor area is being investigated worldwide as a solution for deep tissue theranostics interventions. Moreover, as the development of biophotonics techniques permits bioimaging in nanoscale, both photodynamic and photothermal sensing should be achieved even at cellular level with minimum perturbation, i.e., in absence of any physical contact between cells and sensing units at a single-cell level via optical tweezers. In our work, we discuss the biophotonic upconversion mechanism of nanoparticles' excitation/emission at cellular level, under laser trapping conditions, via considering laser radiation of NIR (specifically at lambda = 808 nm) for optimal penetration in biological tissues. Moreover, a theoretical simulation model will be presented for evaluation of the electric field distribution in optically trapped particles. Water soluble UPCNPs with maximum absorbance wavelength at lambda = 808 nm and emission at 545 nm and 660 nm will be studied. The photoluminescence of biocompatible UPCNPs could provide a promising powerful tool for PDT single-cell analysis and/or for photothermal enhancement and sensing in an optical tweezers' platform.

AB Pulsed laser ablation in liquids is utilized for preparation of composite nanostructures on the basis of TixO2x-1 and Ag. Plates of bulk Ti and Ag immersed in the corresponding liquid serve as targets in the ablation procedure. A nanosecond Nd:YAG pulsed laser is employed as a source of irradiation. Its fundamental wavelength and the third and fourths harmonic are used both to fabricate and to change the chemical composition and the morphology of the nanostructures considered. The procedure for synthesis of complex nanostructures is performed following a specific sequence, namely, the consecutive laser ablation of the selected targets is followed by a post-ablation irradiation of the colloid obtained of the complex nanostructures. The changes in the characteristics of the complex nanostructures are indirectly evaluated based on the profile of the optical transmission spectra of the as-obtained colloids. The colloids' properties are controlled by varying the laser beam parameters. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is applied for direct visualization of their shape. The chemical composition and the morphology were assessed by high-resolution TEM and SAED analyses.

AB In the context of global warming, cities promote temporary or permanent public space designs based on the integration of various cooling techniques, hereafter called spatio-climatic devices, to locally cool down the atmosphere and preserve urban liveability. Such public spaces create interaction opportunities for citizens to seek thermal pleasure outdoors. To inform about the citizens' thermal experience of these spaces, this paper explores fieldwork and data analysis methods at the crossroads of urban climatology, environmental psychology and urban design. Four spatio-climatic configurations are investigated in the 'Extraordinary Garden' in Nantes (France) through mobile microclimate measurements and ethnographic observations. By applying an 'urban transect' approach, preliminary selected microclimate, behavioural and activity observation data is displayed together with spatial information. This allows to highlight thermal situations induced by urban design and to link them to specific citizen-environment interactions. As a result, this approach contributes to a better characterization of urban cool spots as a strategy for more resilient public spaces.

AB Monitoring systems are essential for the energy-efficient and comfortable operation of buildings. However, today's monitoring solutions are relatively expensive in terms of purchase, installation, and maintenance. At the same time, there is a need for low-cost monitoring systems, especially for smaller buildings. To address this need, a novel do-it-yourself, low-cost building monitoring system based on open technologies has been developed. The system is intended to be assembled and put into operation by laymen in accordance with given instructions. Accordingly, all work stages must be simple and obvious. This paper describes the low-cost monitoring system and its prototype implementation.

AB We study wind farm wakes with large eddy simulations (LES) and use these results for the evaluation of engineering models such as the Jensen model, the coupled wake boundary layer model (CWBL), the Turbulence Optimized Park model (TurbOPark), and the wind farm model developed by Niayifar and Porte-Agel (Energies 9, 741 (2016)). We study how well these models capture the wake effects between two aligned wind farms with 72 turbines separated by 10 kilometers in a neutral boundary layer. We find that all considered models over-predict the wind farm wake recovery compared to what is observed in LES. The TurbOPark model predictions on the wind farm wake effect are closest to the LES results for the scenario considered here.

AB As a disease, COVID-19 has shaken the world in 2020/21. Countermeasures have been taken by governments to protect against infection, which have also affected the water and energy consumption of buildings. In particular, buildings managed by public authorities (e.g. kindergartens, schools and administrative offices) have been closed and reopened with different concepts. In this paper, the impact of countermeasures on the electrical and thermal energy and water consumption of municipal buildings is investigated using monitoring data of 100 buildings from 2018 to 2021 of a city in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) in Germany. Where available, data of CO2 sensors from building automation systems are included in the evaluation. The CO2 concentration is in a range of concern (1500-2000 ppm) for 2% of presence periods. A value in the unacceptable range (>2000 ppm) is not found in the CO2 data. Since only ventilation-conditioned spaces are equipped with CO2 sensors, no conclusions can be drawn about non-ventilated buildings. We investigate to which extent the measures taken have changed the energy and water consumption. On total average, the heat demand increased lightly by 5% and water and electricity demand decreased by 15% and 12% respectively.

AB Ensuring energy quality, i.e. compliance with specified or standardised energy performance indicators of buildings over the entire life cycle, can reduce the climate impact of the building sector. In this work, the causes for quality deficiencies in small building services installations as well as the structure of actors interacting with building services were analysed. On this basis, we developed a solution approach in the form of an information model including a catalogue of all requirements and the necessary content to address and improve the quality assurance of HVAC in small buildings. This information model will serve as the basis for future digital tools that can perform (partially) automated heating load calculations and the design of heating systems, improve installation logistics and installation quality through providing information and the necessary processing, and enable improved hydraulic balancing and control.

ID IMPLEMENTATION; PERFORMANCE
AB On a global scale, buildings are a major cause for primary energy consumption. Since buildings are complex multiple input multiple output systems and characterized by slow dynamics, model predictive control is a promising approach to reduce building energy consumption. Due to the high individual modeling effort model predictive control lacks practical applicability. For that reason black box process models are gaining more and more interest in scientific literature. In this work we evaluate the performance of an ANN based controller against a white box controller with perfect knowledge. We show that the data driven controller achieves a similar control quality as the white box controller. We initially train the data driven controller in 20 days and then employ an online learning strategy to continuously improve the control quality.

AB Magnetostriction effect of a spherical sample of a magnetoactive elastomer (MAE) is analyzed. In comparison with the preceding study, the consideration is done on a more realistic basis: taking into account saturation of the MAE magnetization in contrast to the former model where the magnetization was supposed to be linear whatever the field strength. This more thorough investigation has revealed that the striction-induced elongation effect, depending on the material parameters, may occur in two forms. One scenario manifests itself as tapering of the polar zones of the former sphere, where 'beaks' are formed, so that the shape of the object drastically deviates from a spheroidal one. The mechanism the underlies the occurrence of beaks is the surface instability of a magnetizable elastic continuum, and the beak nucleation follows the second-order transition pattern; the resulting overall elongation of the body does not display any hysteresis. Another scenario-it is related to MAEs with higher magnetic properties and softer matrices-implies that the beak formation happens simultaneously with a jump-like overall elongation of the former sphere, and this transformation resembles the first-order transition pattern. Upon assessing the chances to observe the predicted effects on the samples of now existing MAEs, one comes to a conclusion that the second scenario is hardly possible, whereas the first one, i.e., beak formation without hysteretic stretching, is much more realizable.

ID TIME-SERIES
AB The integration of renewable energy sources into building energy systems and the progressive coupling between the thermal and electrical domains makes the analysis of these systems increasingly complex. At the same time, however, more and more building monitoring data is being collected. The manual evaluation of this data is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Hence, there is a strong need for tools that enable the automatic knowledge extraction from these huge data sets to support system integrators and favor the development of smart energy services, e.g., predictive maintenance. One crucial step in knowledge extraction is the detection of change points and hidden states in measurements. In this work, we present a tool for automated detection of hidden operation modes based on multivariate time series data deploying motif-aware state assignment (MASA). The tool is evaluated utilizing measurements of a heat pump and compared to two baseline algorithms, namely k-Means and k-Medoids. MASA performs particularly well on noisy data, where it shows only a small deviation in the number of detected change points compared to the ground truth with up to 77% accuracy. Furthermore, it almost always outperforms the baseline algorithms, which in turn require extensive preprocessing.

AB The conditions for cities to supply themselves with climate-neutral energy sources vary greatly around the world and depend on many parameters such as the climate, settlement density, intensity of land use, geographical conditions and the economic development stage of the country. Climate-neutral energy system solutions for 7 cities and counties in Europe, Asia and Africa were calculated and compared to identify climate zone-depending patterns for the structures of climate-neutral energy systems. It could be demonstrated that climate zones have a strong influence on the design of climate-neutral energy supply systems, both in terms of renewable energy provision (e.g. solar radiation) and energy consumption (e.g. space heating demand).

AB This study aims to know the comparison of students' critical thinking skills profiles in classes that apply the inquiry-based learning model and students in classes that apply a problem-based learning model. The profile of the critical thinking skills was analyzed with the descriptive quantitative method. This research was conducted at SMA Negeri 1 Tempilang, West Bangka Regency, Bangka Belitung Islands Province. Sampling was done by random technique. The total sample used was 50 students divided into two research classes. Class XI MIPA 1 applies the inquiry-based learning model while Class XI MIPA 2 implements a problem-based learning model. The results of the analysis showed that class XI MIPA 1 had a better critical thinking skill profile compared to class XI MIPA 2 on all critical thinking skills indicators. Therefore, it can be concluded that the inquiry-based learning model has a better effect on the profile of students' critical thinking skills on thermochemistry material than the problem-based learning model.

AB The effect of non-axisymmetric inertial waves on the zonal flow structure in a rotating spherical shell is studied experimentally. The wave source is the inner core, which performs circular oscillations in the equatorial plane. The case of positive frequencies that corresponds to the advanced core motion is considered. As a result of non-linear effects, a quasi-two-dimensional axisymmetric steady flow with a complex distribution of angular velocity is generated. The extrema in the velocity profile are equivalent to the nested liquid geostrophic cylinders, which appearance is due to the interaction of the inertial waves within a viscous boundary layer. One of the extrema is associated with the critical latitude at the core boundary, where the inertial waves are excited. With an increase in the oscillation frequency, the position of this extremum gradually shifts to the rotation axis. Additional geostrophic circulation occurs close to the points where the inertial wave reflects from the cavity boundary.

AB As one of the sustainable development goals (SDGs), good health and wellbeing needs to be supported especially through science education program. Therefore, this research is aimed to examine the effect of a 5E learning scenario in biology instruction on nutrition and digestive system topic towards high school students' health literacy. This was a quasi-experimental research that involved two groups of students from a public high school in Bantul region, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. One group played as a treatment group who learned the topic using 5E learning scenario, whilst another one as the control group who was taught by lecturing method. Pre-test and post-test instruments were employed to collect students' health literacy data and analysed descriptively towards its indicators as well as statistically using Wilcoxon and Mann U Whitney. The findings show that the treatment group's health literacy skill is significantly better than the control group (0.00; p:0.05). Therefore, it is concluded that the 5E-learning model implemented in this research evident more effective in fostering students' health literacy.

AB The purpose of this study is to describe the prior mathematical proficiency of students in terms of gender analyzed by the Rasch model. Participants consisted of a class of secondsemester students who contacted analytic geometry courses comprised of 11 men and 29 women at one of the universities in Indonesia. The research instrument was a test item describing five questions about points and lines in the plane. The results showed students answered questions according to their level of ability, and there was no gender bias. Therefore in learning that will carried out in groups should be heterogeneous from the prior level of mathematical and gender prior knowledge.

AB The combined scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and the break-junction tunneling spectroscopy (BJTS) measurements of the three-layered Pb(x)Bi(2-x)Sr(2)Ca(2)Cu(3)O(10+)y cuprate superconductors were carried out. The averaged dI/dV spectrum obtained by the STS shows the gap Delta(STS) approximate to 45 meV, while that of BJTS shows Delta(BJ) approximate to 35 meV. In case of the BJTS measurements, we also referred the zero bias (ZB) peak as being due to the maximum Josephson current I-Jc. The product of IJc and normal resistance RN (IJc RN) was obtained I-Jc R-N approximate to 3.5 mV at T = 11 K, which is one order lower than that of the BCS-based Ambegaokar-Baratoff theory with Delta(BJ) =35 meV taken into account. With increasing the temperature, the I-Jc RN was reduced and vanished just below the T-c (approximate to 106 K), indicating the bulk superconductivity. Simultaneously, from the temperature dependence of the gap features from 80 K to 120 K, the gap D was shown to persist across the T-c, indicating that the I(J)c R-N product is a significant parameter for understanding the cuprate superconductivity.

AB This study aims to identify the misconception of the students' in biology learning especially in cell type and general characteristics of cell at senior high school level. By using data profiling, the data were collected from 31 first grade students (15-16-year old). The analysis of students' misconception used the instrument of AAAS Science Assessment. The item consists of 31 items of multiple choices questions and one open-ended essay question. The result obtained then processed by analysing the students' answers for each item. The results showed that 51% of students' understanding in type of cells and its general characteristics has experienced misconception. So, we can say that students' understanding of cell concepts in first grade senior high school still low. It would be better to conduct further research to find out the causes that influence students' misconceptions in understanding cell concept.

AB Student knowledge criteria is one aspect that shows the success of a learning process. According to pedagogy subject matter, learning is successful if the students' knowledge has reached the fruitful criteria. This research aims to determine the formative assessment of fruitful criteria in work and energy learning based on directing motives and syntactic aspects. The research method used is qualitative with a case study approach. Data were analyzed using discourse analysis. Sample of this research are teacher and students at one school in the Bandung district was conducted on the teaching motives of educators, aspects of teaching materials and formative assessment used in learning activities with data collection techniques in the form of direct and indirect observation using a video recorder with an observation sheet and indicator motives, aspects and criteria sheet. The analysis is done by making a transcript of learning activities, making basic texts with refinement, preparing micro and macro propositions so that the learning macro structure is obtained. Furthermore, the analysis is carried out with reference to the indicators of each motif, aspect, and criteria. The results showed there were six formative assessment questions of fruitful criteria based on directing motives and syntactic aspects or appears at 37.5% of the total fruitful criteria formative assessment. The researcher suggests doing research on other criteria so that it can be known in full the types of questions for formative assessment based on the pedagogy subject matter approach

AB The aim of study is to investigate the lecture process of Mathematical Method for Physics. The model is to develop the concept and ability of mathematical logical thinking of students of Physics Education Study Program. Mathematical Method for Physics is used to study physics related to how to systematically find out about nature. The research subjects consisted of 2 lecturers, and students who had taken Mathematical Method for Physics Courses, namely levels 3 and 4. The number of students filling out questionnaires was 94 students. Observations were conducted in class. Observations are focused on the learning process in the class. Data was collected using questionnaires to get student responses to the implementation of lectures. The results of the study were as many as 57.82%. of students gave positive statements about the implementation of lectures, while the rest gave negative statements. This shows that studying physics is not only mastery of a collection of knowledge in the form of facts, concepts, or principles, but also an inquiry process. Therefore, the challenge in facing the 21st century is to improve the quality of education. Learning innovation is adjusted to the demands of educational change in the era of industrial revolution 4.0 (millennial). Learning must utilize information, communication, and technology (ICT). Innovation requires the support of a learning process that can strengthen creativity through critical thinking skills.

AB This study aims to formulate the RADEC learning model with full online learning mode in natural science instruction, both through synchronous and asynchronous communications. This research belongs to the type of qualitative description with the participants involved consisting of 20 students and 5 teachers taken based on a purposive sampling technique. The instruments used were a questionnaire and unstructured interviews that were processed with triangulation techniques. The results of this study indicate that 1) At the Read stage the teacher provides opportunities for students to enrich knowledge from various sources through asynchronous communication, 2) At the Answer stage, students also answer pre-learning questions through asynchronous communication, 3) At the Discuss stage, the teacher divides students into small groups. Students discuss pre-learning questions in their groups then answer them through asynchronous communication. Students' answer is the sources information for the teacher to classify concepts based on difficulty level, 4) At the Explain stage, the teacher is a moderator who gives students opportunities to rebut or support the answers. The teacher also leads students to have scientifically conceptual knowledge with probing questions through synchronous communication, 5) In the Create stage, students agree, realize, and report ideas on the product. They have to present the product through synchronous communication.

AB We investigated the possibility of controlled levitation of particles in the air under the influence of wideband ultrasonic waves. We examined the interference field formed by the radiation of counterpropagating emitters of signals with linear frequency modulation. It is proposed to use two counter-directed emitter arrays focused at the center. The focusing of the emitter arrays is achieved due to the fact that the elements of the arrays are placed on the surface of the sphere in a certain sector. Then the focus point is the center of the sphere at any radiation frequency. When a common- mode wideband signal is applied to all elements of the array, focusing of the wideband signal is achieved in the center of the sphere. When a monochromatic signal is applied, a levitation region elongated along the axis of the system is formed. We consider the case when the distance between the radiating gratings is several times larger than the size of the aperture of the gratings. For wideband signals particles are grouped into a single stable pressure node of standing waves in the center of the system. This provides a single local minimum potential for the selective control of an individual particle. Moreover, a force arises that draws particles into the central region.

AB The Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on change in various fields, including in higher education. This study provides an overview of the survey result of the experience of 14 lecturers of the Mathematics Education Study Program at the University of Sanata Dharma towards learning in responding to Pandemic Covid-19. The intended experience includes the strategies and technologies used in learning, learning success in terms of the achievement of objectives and student involvement, and planning for future learning. The results showed that (1) all lecturers conducted distance learning by utilizing various kinds of technology both synchronous and asynchronous as a form of learning adjustment to face a pandemic. (2) Although there was an adjustment in learning, most mathematics learning can run according to learning achievements. (3) The Mathematics Education lecturer will implement an improvement in learning that must be carried out online. The improvement is in the form of preparation and planning of learning, the use of more varied technologies, the use of more innovative methods of delivering material, adjustment of learning in terms of learning achievement and evaluation while still focusing on developing student experience.

AB Higher-order-thinking skills (HOTS) are skills that must be possessed to be globally competitive in the 21st century. Therefore, HOTS should be trained and assessed in learning, including learning physics. To measure HOTS, you need questions that agree with the HOTS criterion. Not all physics teachers understand the characteristics of HOTS. This study aimed to practice the skills of making HOTS-based physics questions for physics teacher in Mojokerto. The method used is a one-shot case study. Physics teachers understand HOTS characteristics and trained on how to make HOTS questions starting from fundamental competency analysis in the curriculum to creating HOTS questions for physics. The results showed that 60% of the teachers who were able to complete the task of making HOTS-based physics questions from all the participants who attended the training activities. It shows that efforts are still needed to improve teachers' quality and capacity in preparing HOTS questions for physics subjects.

AB Achievement emotions have an important role in students' Mathematics learning outcomes. The dynamic of achievement emotions in mathematics learning evaluation is very important to be considered by the teachers so that students' academic achievement can be improved. This study was conducted to investigate female students' achievement emotions in mathematical problem-solving situations. The study involved 50 seventh grade female students selected by using purposive sampling technique. The data were collected through achievement emotions questionnaires and mathematical problem- solving ability tests. The data were analyzed using Wilcoxon test and Kendal's Tau correlation test. The findings indicated that mathematical problem-solving situation gave significant small negative effect in decreasing students' joyful emotion. Moreover, it also gave significant small positive effect in increasing students' depressed emotion. In addition, there was a significant moderate correlation between mathematical problem-solving ability and students' joyful emotions after the test. Based on the findings, Mathematics teachers were recommended to take control over the students and improve students' perceived control and confidence value during Mathematics evaluation so that their emotional condition could be well-controlled. Therefore, they could acquire good achievement and the learning objectives could be attained.

AB In this article, a low-cost, portable syringe-vial experimental activity of gas-generating reactions is reported for easy illustration of the concept of chemical reaction rate in a regular classroom context. The equipment setup consists of a Luer-lock plastic syringe, a vial and its screw-cap connected to a syringe by a 3-way Luer-lock stopcock for the quantification of the gaseous product generated from the reaction. To operate the kit, an acid solution is first poured into the vial, then a plastic container of sodium bicarbonate is carefully floated on the solution. All three components of the kit are gently connected together. Finally, the vial is shaken to start the reaction and then the volume of the gas product is collected in the syringe versus time. This activity allows students to easily investigate the rate of reaction and also concentrations affecting it by plotting a relation between volume of gas product with time.

AB The aim of the research was to visualise abstract physics concepts through a PicsAR (Physics Augmented Reality) application to enhance students' thinking skills in abstract concepts. Previously, the researchers developed the PicsAR by utilising Research and Development (R & D) design with an ADDLE model (Analysis, Design, Develop, Implementation, and Evaluation) and reported through previous publication. It has claimed that the PicsAR has fulfilled the criteria of valid, practice, and effective. The atomic model was exemplified as an abstract concept in physics as an outcome of visualisation. Totally, 33 high school students with their teacher in Surabaya Indonesia contributed to this study. To explore students' thinking skills in abstract concepts, the descriptive statistics were used in guiding the data analysis. The visualisation of research trends in physics augmented reality was performed by VOSviewer software. Empirically, the finding of the research described the feature of PicsAR and the performance of the augmented reality of atomic models. Additionally, students' abstract thinking skills of atomic models were also discussed, including four types of reasoning: proportional, probabilistic, combinatorial, and correlational reasoning. Overall, the students achieved excellent of all proportional reasoning indicators, two-thirds of probabilistic and correlational reasoning indicators, and seventy-five percent of combinatorial reasoning indicators.

AB Semiconductor materials used as potential barriers in the study are GaAs, GaSb, and AlAs. These materials will be arranged in certain combinations to form triple potential barrier structures and the effect of combinations will be analysed against transmission coefficient values. In this study, the maximum energy of the electron is 1 eV and the matrix propagation method is used where the effect of the combinations structure on transmission coefficient values is numerically analysed using a computational program. The results showed that the structuring potential barrier affects the value of the transmission coefficient. In the uniform barriers arrangements, the value of the transmission coefficient decreases with increasing potential barrier energy. Whereas in the arrangement of different barrier combinations, two opposing combination arrangements have the same transmission coefficient values. Thus, from six combination arrangements, there are three kinds of transmission coefficient values. The maximum transmission coefficient value is 1.000 in the triple potential barrier of GaSb at 0.49 eV. Research on the tunnel effect contributed to the development of electronic and optoelectronic devices such as transistors and lasers.

AB Various efforts must be made by the government in the education sector in the 21st century and industrial era 4.0 so that students have the life skills needed is to implement integrated education starting from the family, school and community environment through literacy cultural habituation. Several studies have shown low attainment of scientific literacy. A high level of scientific literacy can improve the quality of education so that it can compete with other countries. This study aims to describe the level of scientific literacy of high school students in East Java. The method used in this research is descriptive quantitative. The data collection technique was in the form of a written test. The research variable is the science literacy ability of high school students in the content aspect. Samples were taken using purposive sampling. Overall, the average percentage of the results of high school students' scientific literacy skills in East Java based on the aspect of science content is in the low category. The level of students' understanding of basic science concepts is still low or weak, so that students are less able to apply and interpret data, even though the form of the problem is simple. The cause of the low ability of students is in expressing the content of the discourse given and interpreting the data in the form of pictures, tables, diagrams and other forms of presentation. In addition, there are limitations to the students' ability to express thoughts in written form, reasoning skills, reading accuracy is still low, and students are not used to connecting information in the form of text and then expressing it in the form of new expressions to answer given test questions.

AB Someone with special interest in a topic will easily participate in learning activities and easily adapt to the learning environment as needed. The purpose of this study is to analyze students' interest in chemistry based on student learning experiences in classroom. In this study, a questionnaire containing several statements about students' interests was distributed. The questionnaire was developed based on four categories, namely the level of student interest in chemistry, personal choice, teacher's role, and situational interest. The number of students who participated in this study was 61 students in high schools in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Questionnaire data were analyzed quantitatively as means, standard deviations, and percentages, then categorized as low, medium, or high. Data shows that as many as 29.2% of students have high interest, 67.2% of students have moderate interest, and 3.3% of students have low interest. Female students are more interested in chemistry than male students. This research can be useful as additional information for teachers and other researchers to increase student interest because interest influences the learning process.

AB This study aims to determine the comparison of enhancement students' mathematical critical thinking skills between those who obtain Means - Ends Analysis (MEA) and Treffinger learning, as well as to find out the mathematical critical thinking skills of students who use Means - Ends Analysis (MEA) and Treffinger learning. The method used in this research is descriptive and quasi-experimental methods. The population in this study were students of class X MIPA SMA 3 Tasikmalaya. Two classes were taken randomly as samples, selected in class X MIPA 2 with 35 students as experimental class I using MEA and X MIPA 3 with 32 students as experimental class II using Treffinger learning. The instrument used was a test of students' mathematical critical thinking skills. The data analysis technique used two mean difference tests, using a t-test with a significance level of 5%. The results of research and data analysis show that enhancement students' mathematical critical thinking skills using MEA learning is better than those using Treffinger learning, critical thinking skills using learning are MEA included in both criteria and skills critical thinking using Treffinger learning is included in both criteria.

AB Freshwater gastropods are benthic fauna whose live under the water surface or attached to the bottom rocks of the river, pond, or lake. Ranu Grati is a freshwater lake located in District Pasuruan, East Java. Information on gastropod community from this lake is still scarce. We surveyed Ranu Grati from November 2019 until February 2020 to find out the gastropod's diversity. We found 118 individual gastropoda consist of five families and six species. Gastropod's community in Ranu Grati was classified as moderate (H '= 1,415). Morphology of each species will be discussed briefly in this paper.

AB Creative thinking is one of the high-level thinking skill as a form of finding the best solution to solve a problem that emphasizes aspects of fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of using STMCpE based Chemo-entrepreneurship textbooks on students' creative thinking skill on Acid - Base Material. This is a quasi-experimental research with nonequivalent control group design. Data obtained from the results of creative thinking tests conducted in the experimental class and the control class before and after learning. Pretests are used as student's premier knowledge data and the data after learning are used as data for different tests using ANCOVA. The results showed that the creative thinking skill of students who studied with STMCpE Based Chemo-entrepreneurship Textbook higher than students who studied with conventional learning with a significance value of 0.000<0.050. A large percentage of the effect of the application of STMCpE Based Chemo-entrepreneurship Textbook 87.7%. This shows that the creative thinking skill of students who learn with STMCpE Based Chemo-entrepreneurship Textbook is better than classes that use school textbooks.

AB Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is important to be developed in Indonesia to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The lack of identification in implementing ESD lead to the lack of a representation of ESD in Indonesia. This research aims to identify and to analyze the ESD implementation models that are applied in Adiwiyata school and ESD-based school in Indonesia and how the pupils' Sustainable Consciousness are. Respondents involved in this studies are 27 pupils from both schools. Observation, interview and SC Likert-scale questionnaire with 51 statements were used as the instruments. The questionnaire consisted of environmental, social, and economic dimensions that considered pupils' knowingness, attitude and behaviour. The results show that the ESD implementation model that refers to Burmeister & Eilks (2012) conducted by Adiwiyata and ESD schools consisted of 2 models. Model 2 with Adding Sustainable Science as Content in the Science and Technology Curriculum and model 4 with Science Education as a Part of ESDDriven School Development. The pupils' SC in the environmental dimensions of pupils in Adiwiyata schools have significant different with ESD-based schools. But, for the results of the pupils' SC in the Economic and Social dimension have no significant different.

AB Superconductors can trap large magnetic fields. However, magnetic fields perpendicular to the trapped field reduces the trapped field effective, which is known as crossed-field demagnetization. Crossed-field demagnetization becomes a problem for the application of stacked magnet. We investigated the crossed-field demagnetization of a EuBa2Cu3O7 coated conductor with BaHfO3 nonorods which has large critical current density. When an AC transverse field is applied after the magnetization of the coated conductor, the decay of trapped field was significantly accelerated. However, for the AC field smaller than the full penetration field parallel to the ab-plane, the decay becomes slow enough. All these results suggests that we can apply the stacked magnet for rotating machines if the alternating transverse magnetic field is reduced below the penetration field.

AB Good understanding of micro-scale urban-wind phenomena is needed for optimizing power generation capabilities of building-integrated wind turbines and for safety of futuristic urban transport involving drones. The current work involves development of a multiscale methodology for obtaining wind fields in an urban landscape. The multi-scale methodology involves coupling three models operating on different scales namely an operational meso-scale numerical weather prediction model HARMONIE, a micro-scale model that captures terrain-induced wind influence and a super-micro scale Computational Fluid Dynamics model using large eddy simulation and RANS model to capture the building-induced wind flow. Here, we present a comparison of the wind velocity predicted by two different turbulence models (LES and RANS) that are operating at the finest scale with the measured experiment data for a realistic case of flow in vicinity of the Oslo university hospital. The reasons behind the observed better prediction of LES model are outlined, and use of such models is advocated to improve accuracy.

AB In this study, we present a parametric non-intrusive reduced order modeling framework as a potential digital twin enabler for fluid flow related applications. The case study considered here involves building-induced flows and turbulence with inlet turbulence value as a parameter. The framework proposed employs a Grassmann manifold interpolation approach (GI) for obtaining basis functions corresponding to new values of parameter, and exploits the time series prediction capability of long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network for obtaining temporal coefficients associated with the new basis functions. The methodology works in the following way: (i) in the training phase, the LSTM model is trained on the modal coefficients extracted from the high-resolution data using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) transform for the known values of parameter, and (ii) in the testing phase, the trained model predicts the modal coefficients for the total time recursively based on the initial time history for the new value of parameter. Then, we reconstruct the flow fields for the new value of parameter (new inlet turbulent value) using the GI modulated basis functions and LSTM predicted associated temporal coefficients. To assess the performance of the proposed model, the ROM-LG predictions are compared with the high-dimensional full-order model solutions using L1 and L2 error analyses as well as with the conventional POD based ROM (ROM-POD) solutions. The results indicate that the non-intrusive ROM (ROM-LG) framework yields a stable solution for the velocity fields and for short-term prediction of dynamic turbulent kinetic energy fields. This work has scope for further development and will be useful for building-integrated wind energy and urban drone operation in a smart-city digital twin platform.

AB Residual stresses are common in metal structures, essentially influencing their mechanical behaviour. We consider a combined experimental/theoretical approach to residual stresses. The theoretical basis of analysis is provided by the recently developed F0-approach, operating with explicit relation between load-free and stress-free configurations. The titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V is modelled with the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into the elastic and the plastic parts. Isotropic hyperelastic relations between stresses and elastic strains are assumed. The weak invariance of the material model allows for incorporation of residual stresses without additional numerical costs. In order to demonstrate the new experimental/theoretical approach to residual stresses, experimentally measured stresses are extrapolated from the surface inside the welded T-joint. The robustness of the stress extrapolation procedure is confirmed on synthetic experimental data.

AB In many high-temperature superconducting (HTS) rotating machines of radial flux type, the magnetic field from one side surface of the field pole is employed facing the armature winding. However, both side surfaces of the field pole can be effectively utilised to face the armature windings. Thus, we have applied the double armature structure in which both inner and outer armature rotors sandwiched the field pole stator in the HTS synchronous generator. We introduce the first step design and the electromagnetic study of the double armature synchronous machine for tidal current power generation. The double armatures with copper winding were adopted with a field pole composed of the HTS bulks. The power and the torque density were calculated with a low speed that depends on a 500 kW contra-rotating turbine design. In this paper, we comparatively studied three electromagnetic designs in which (1) a permanent magnet was used for the field pole, (2) the HTS bulk was employed as the field pole and (3) the field pole HTS bulk was arranged at an angle in the x-y plane, reducing torque ripple due to torque consistency and tilting of the HTS bulk plate. A generator model consistent with the input mechanical torque of the turbine was obtained from the analysis of compatibility with the 500 kW class tidal current power generation.

AB The use of mathematical software in learning has been widely applied. This meta-analysis study was conducted to examine the " Hawthorne effect", or the novelty of using mathematical software in learning. Related databases are sought for studies that qualify for examining the effects of using mathematical software compared to traditional teaching on students' mathematical abilities. Random-effect models with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. 40 effect sizes were analyzed from 40 primary studies that have been published in journals, or national and international proceedings from 2010 to 2020, and a total of 3072 students were included in this meta-analysis. The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) program is used to assist analysis. As a result of the study, the overall effect size was 0.886 with a standard error of 0.092. The results of the follow-up analysis showed that the duration of the treatment was related to the use of mathematical software. It was found that the use of mathematical software given in the span of 0 - 4 weeks (effect size = 1.193) was more effective if carried out in more than 4 weeks (effect size = 0.535). Thus the Hawthorne effect influences the effectiveness of the use of mathematical software on students' mathematical abilities. This fact is considered by education practitioners in using mathematical software in the future.

AB Bruxism is considered an oral parafunction of involuntary grinding and clenching of the teeth. Occlusal splints are the most common method of preventing bruxism and its consequences. Their application significantly reduces the pathologies of the dental and periodontal structures. Infrared thermography is a noncontact method of temperature measurement whereby the detector is pointed remotely at a single spot. The purpose of the study is registering by means of infrared thermography the changes in the muscular activity during the period of occlusal splint prophylaxis. In the presence of pathological changes, splint therapy aims to return the joint-muscular complex of the masticatory apparatus to normal, which is associated with the activation of the adaptive capabilities of the organism. This dynamic process is associated with a rise in temperature. When achieving balance after wearing the splints for one and three months, a decrease in the registered temperature is naturally observed due to the created preconditions for elimination of the inflammation of the joint and the overload of the muscles.

ID ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS
AB Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a reliable, fast and microdestructive diagnostic method for qualitative and quantitative analysis of a variety of materials. In this paper, we report the results of quantitative determination of antimony in four archaeological bronze artefacts analyzed by means of LIBS. For the purpose of this study, an approach of multi-elemental quantitative LIBS analysis is proposed, based on the use of an element with known concentration as an internal standard and measurement of the spectral lines intensities of the internal standard and the element with unknown concentration. An important plasma parameter which is included in the quantitative analysis is the excitation temperature as determined by the Boltzmann plot method. The quantity of antimony in the bronze artefacts obtained by means of the proposed LIBS approach is between 1.49% and 3.13%.

AB The purpose of this research was to reconstruct HOTS questions using questions in mathematics textbooks. The study was conducted used a research and development method. The objects of research and development were questions in mathematics textbooks using in junior high school. The research procedure consisted of collecting and selecting textbooks in mathematics instruction, selecting the topic of the subject, identifying and selecting problems, and reconstructing HOTS items. The item reconstruction phase included expert judgment and field trials. HOTS problem reconstruction was carried out through the improvement of questions in the textbooks so that the answers were not unique; the solution required several mathematical concepts and the use of other knowledge. The results showed that questions in mathematics textbooks could be reconstructed as HOTS questions. HOTS problem reconstruction can be achieved by changing the problem in such a way that it does not have a single solution, using a variety of mathematical concepts and other knowledge.

AB One way to achieve increased wind capacity is by installing larger and more efficient wind turbines, which results in larger/heavier generators. Direct-drive, permanent magnet generators are favoured due to their increased efficiency, but the added weight is an issue, as this drives up the cost of the nacelle and turbine support structure, along with increasing the manufacturing and installation costs. Therefore, minimizing the mass, particularly the structural mass, of these low speed generators is becoming much more important. A vast amount of research has been done on trying to reduce the electromagnetically 'active' materials, but it is the supporting structure or 'inactive' materials, that makes up the biggest percentage of the generator's mass. Therefore, this paper studies the statics and dynamics of a large offshore direct-drive generator's supporting structure and the opportunities for light-weighting, as well as improvements to the generator's rotor structure through structural optimisation. The indicator for optimised design is system weight under each predefined scenario. These scenarios will cover different design considerations of the generator's rotor structure.

AB Destruction of the laser-induced coherence in the ground state of alkali atoms manifests itself as an ultra-narrow resonance in the atomic spectrum. Depending on the geometry of irradiation and observation, the coherent spectroscopy studies CPT (coherent population trapping), EIT (electromagnetically-induced transparency) or EIA (electromagnetically-induced absorption). In the present work, we investigated EIA on the D-1 Rb-87 line by applying a counter-propagating dual-beam scheme. The main advantage of this scheme is the high resonance contrast - an important parameter for many applications. In our previous work performed in a paraffin-coated cell we observed that, unlike the resonance in buffer gas cell detected in the same experimental scheme, the EIA signal has a complex form, because it is formed by two atomic sub-ensembles in the vapor cell with different relaxation rates determined by the laser excitation conditions. We focused on the narrow component, since it has a higher amplitude-width ratio, making it preferable for applications. We investigate the influence of the atomic vapor density and the pump laser intensity on the resonance parameters in order to optimize the amplitude ratio of the wide and narrow components and achieve the highest amplitude-width ratio value for the narrow component of the EIA resonance.

AB With the increase of Urban Heat Islands (UHI) and the effects of global warming, cities will face challenges in anticipating these phenomena. However, the complexity of urban development within the framework of urban planning policies, makes difficult for urban decision-makers to anticipate the Urban Heat Islands within their territory. In this paper, we propose a methodology to assess the impact of urban planning policies on Urban Heat Island. Thanks to a coupling of 2D urban growth model, 3D constructability model and urban microclimate simulation, this tool will make it possible to visualize the impact of urban planning decisions on urban form and on Urban Heat Island.

AB T.E.A. M. is a research project that was created to facilitate the design of kinetic projects and components created through a computational design process. Time is the ingredient that allows dynamism. The following paper examines the core features of Platform One, an experimental digital application born within the project and aimed at supporting designers during the development, in a VE (Virtual Environment) of dynamic architectures and components, as well as the principles that inspired it. The application presents two key features: the first one is that everything modified and developed in the VE retains its geometric characteristics, allowing the user to reach an informed 3D model at the end of the process; the second one is the ease and enjoyment with which the user manipulates complex dynamic geometries in the threedimensional environment through a natural interface design approach that focuses on direct manipulation of architectural objects and components. The simulator is designed to be used in a 6DOF virtual environment using a commercial VR headset. It has currently been loaded with several archetypal test architectures and soon it will be available to designers who want to test their work with it.

AB Automated daylight redirecting slat technologies are designed to divert sunlight into the living space. They have a distinct advantage in that they can be retracted and extended, and slat angles can be adjusted according to the solar geometry and sky conditions. This study aimed to explore the geometric and photometric properties of a novel high-efficiency light redirection system (LRS). The LRS prototypes were installed in the clerestory window in the south-facing window testbed office and monitored under real sun and sky conditions. Workplane illuminance, daylight delivery efficiency (DDE) and visual comfort were evaluated. A number of simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the LRS and compare the results to the laboratory tests. The study shows that the specular properties of the slats provided significantly higher work plane illuminance and DDE. All systems showed an acceptable discomfort glare, or daylight glare probability (DGP) lower than 0.35. The comparison of the laboratory test and computer simulation was conducted using a Radiance tool. The results show that, for specular slats, the mkillum method with plastic material provided accurate work plane illuminance compared to the measurement. All simulated DGP shows accurate results compared to the laboratory test.

AB Even though it is scientifically well known that there are various building emissions with harmful impacts on human health and the environment, existing evaluating approaches only refer to selected emissions and life cycle phases. Especially in today's building sector harmful emissions are mainly evaluated in the use stage and the target is to minimize rather than avoid them. However, in order to avoid subsequent negative impacts, implementation strategies have to be developed and applied during early planning phases. This research presents an overview of relevant building emissions as well as a life cycle based approach to allocate these emissions and to show possibilities of influence towards zero emission buildings.

ID QUANTIFICATION
AB Swiss buildings, the majority of which will last beyond 2050, are responsible for a large share of energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, building retrofit is considered as one of the most promising approaches to reduce those shares. However, reducing the energy load should not be an end in itself. The continuous integration of intermittent power sources in the electricity grid imposes new challenges to the supply-demand problem that might directly affect the retrofit process and vice-versa. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a model to analyze the demand flexibility potential of optimal retrofit solutions. Co-simulation and a rolling horizon approach are used to derive upper and lower electricity consumption profiles given some temperature comfort bands. Within those electricity bands, the feasible area provides insights on the extent by which the electricity consumption can be shifted within the comfort constraints. The method is applied to a building archetype. Results show that when the comfort constraints are relaxed the feasible area increases, e.g., up to five times for the case of enhancing the roof insulation, while building retrofit influences the electricity bands. Such a method could enhance the retrofit process and address both the emissions' and the supply-demand balancing problem.

AB In view of the current situation that the range of the existing sinusoidal force calibration device can not fully meet the requirements of dynamic force calibration, this paper provided an introduction on the development of a (2.5 similar to 250) kN sinusoidal force calibration device. For the purpose of expanding the calibration range and reducing the measurement uncertainty of the sinusoidal force, the device is expected to help bridge the gap in the dynamic force traceability system in China and set up the benchmark for high-precision sinusoidal force standards.

AB The professional teachers have to know about the students' critical thinking process. So, a teacher can teach mathematics kindly to students at school. Then, all prospective teachers have to like that to be ready to be a good facilitator in the process of learning mathematics at school and others. This study aimed to describe the critical thinking process expected by prospective teachers to students in solving mathematical problems based on critical thinking stages of Facione's theory. The research method used is descriptive research employing a qualitative approach. The subject of the study was the prospective mathematics teachers who were students of the Mathematics Study Program at Ibrahimy University, Situbondo, Indonesia. The data were collected by giving an essay test item to prospective teachers. The test was given to collect data related to the critical thinking process of prospective mathematics teachers. Moreover, the data collected through observations, tests, and interviews were analyzed and tested for their validity by using triangulation. The data analysis technique used is qualitative descriptive data analysis. The results of this study indicate that: (1) each of group subjects' expectations tend to have different expectations for students' critical thinking processes; (2) the high-group subject tend to expect that students follow and complete all of the critical thinking process stages according to Facione's theory; (3) the moderate and low-group subjects tend not to expect their students to follow and complete all of the critical thinking process stages according to Facione's theory; and (4) the percentage of indicators achievement of critical thinking processes expected by prospective teachers to students in solving problems based on Facione theory was revealed to be; Identify (57.14%), Define (50%), Enumerate (78.57%), Analyze (50%), List (39.29%), and Self-Correct (32.14%). The results of this study can serve as the fundamental to be discussed within the teacher's summit in finding out the critical thinking process expected by teachers towards the students, because it will have a positive impact both on themselves and their students.

   STRATEGY
AB Faults in air-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems lead to energy waste and discomfort. While the emphasis of fault detection and diagnostic (FDD) research has been on hard faults in actuators, sensors, and equipment, faults arising from human errors account for a significant portion of faults occurring in HVAC systems. In this paper, human errors occurring in air handling units (AHUs) and variable air volume (VAV) thermal zones during design, construction, and operation phases are identified through a review of the literature. Then, the faults are divided into six main categories. Based on case studies investigating these faults, the impact of each fault category on occupant comfort, energy consumption, and equipment life is discussed. The authors provide recommendations to minimize human errors in AHUs and VAV zones throughout the building life cycle.

AB This study is being conducted to evaluate the effects of Phase Change Materials (PCM) on thermal comfort in buildings in Reunion Island. Experimental and numerical approaches are used to determine the criteria for the integration of bio-based PCM. A full-scale platform is divided into two rooms, where a layer of PCM is applied to one surface of the test room. Results show that the application of PCM delays the temperature rises and its maximum is reduced by up to 4 degrees. Finally, the experimental results are compared to those of a Dynamic Thermal Simulation (DTS) program to evaluate the ability of such programs to predict the thermal behavior of the building with and without PCM.

AB This paper presents a study of the impact of the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) vessel logistics over the power availability of an Offshore Wind Farm. In particular, the vessel size and availability are considered. The study is performed with a life-span simulator, based on historical metocean data, walk-to-walk characterization based on a frequency domain hydrodynamic modelling of multibody systems, wind farm fault simulator (based on a catalogue of more than 1800 faults) and an algorithm to reproduce the O&M intelligence (i.e. sea transportation, workability, among others). The frequency domain model is applied on an hourly basis considering the specific significant wave height, peak period, peak enhancement factor, mean heading, directional spreading, and a wave-by-wave strategy is used to find if personnel transfer and workability criteria are met. The WindFloat Atlantic wind farm, located off the coast of Viana do Castello (Portugal), was chosen together with the TRL+ project semi-submersible platform and the 10MW turbine as a reference case. Different vessel logistics options are compared, including full vessel availability and several options of waiting times. The power availability changes among the different cases of study could be compared with the cost changes, optimizing the LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy) of the wind farm. The presented study is a valuable example of the potential of the proposed O&M simulation model as an optimization tool.

AB The computational cost of the design optimisation of wind turbines, as well as the optimisation of the operation and maintenance of offshore wind farms represents a limitation to the application of conventional simulation methods. New techniques such as reduced order modelling (ROM) and technologies such as hybrid-analysis methods and digital twins have increased in popularity due to their ability to deliver numerical results at a significant speed-up with reasonable accuracy. This work presents a hybrid projection-based proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) strategy applied to transient turbulent flow problems. Key feature of this work is the applicability of the methodology to high Reynolds number cases and the stabilisation of pressure in the online phase via the assembly of the so-called pressure Poisson equation. Another significant part of this work is the implementation of an interpolation scheme for the eddy viscosity field in the classical POD-Galerkin strategy. The sampling procedure and the calculation of the reduced operators in the offline phase is carried out using the finite volume method (FVM), OpenFOAM's libraries specifically, while the construction of the reduced basis and the solution of the online phase is carried out in Python. The capability of the resulting ROM is tested using the two-dimensional flow around a NACA0015 airfoil at 17 degrees angle of attack with Reynolds number of approximately 300 000.

AB This paper presents the results of long-term monitoring of ground subsidence above flooded mining. To assess the change in the shape of ground surface, the data obtained by monitoring the settlement of the foundation of a large group of buildings were used. The control of the slope was carried out using automated hydrostatic level systems mounted on the foundations of 40 buildings located in this area. The accumulated data on the long-term evolution of the tilt were processed using the methods of statistical analysis of non-stationary time series. Choice of forecast model was made based on a comparison of forecast and real monitoring data. A forecast based on 5-year monitoring data predicts that the observed deformation processes in the rock massif will not change over the next 2 years.

AB In this work, we report on our investigations on LIAD (Light Induced Atomic Desorption) aimed at achieving high density of alkali atoms vapor in a coated cell at room temperature. The experimental results show the possibility to reach a density up to the limit when the medium becomes optically thick by applying highly efficient homogeneous illumination. The photon reabsorption mechanism prevents the precise evaluation of the density by measuring the absorption of a probe laser beam, but there is clear evidence that densities can be achieved higher by two orders of magnitude than the thermodynamic equilibrium value.

AB Facing industry 4.0 in the world of education is the responsibility of the teacher in preparing students well. One of them is to build their understanding of learning at school. Mathematics as one of the subjects that always exists in every level of education is very helpful for students in developing systematic and critical thinking, this is in accordance with the needs of students in industrial age 4.0. However, mathematics also has sufficient conditions, namely the need for an understanding of mathematical concepts. The reality found in schools in this study is the understanding of students' low concepts. Therefore, this study aims to improve the understanding of students' concepts through the application of Direct Instruction assisted by incomplete handouts in the topic of composition and inverse function. The research model used is Class Action Research according to Pelton. The research subjects were 21 students of grade XI in one of the West Jakarta High Schools. The data sources used are observation sheets and test sheets. Based on the results of the data analysis, it can be concluded that the implementation of Direct Instruction assisted by Incomplete Handouts can improve students' conceptual understanding.

AB In order to understand how to reduce energy consumption in buildings, all factors affecting occupant comfort and behavior must be considered. Previous work from EPFL has elucidated the influence of daylight on thermal perception and its resulting potential to reduce cooling loads in a controlled test space in Geneva, Switzerland with three different illumination levels (130 lux, 600 lux, and 1400 lux) and under three different indoor air temperature levels (19 degrees C, 23 degrees C, 27 degrees C). Occupants perceived the temperature as up to 2 degrees C cooler when exposed to daylight, leading to reduced cooling loads. For climates with high cooling loads for much of the year, such as Austin, Texas, this reduction could yield significant benefits for low-energy building design. Simulations show the total amount of energy saved from adopting this strategy in Austin, Texas.

AB Knowledge of appropriate science learning techniques can be found through analysis of multi representation abilities which include verbal, image, mathematical and graphic representation. Chemistry as part of science contains concept that can be presented through various representations (multi representation), one of them is a graphical representation. The ability of students to read and interpret graphics will provide additional knowledge for students in learning chemistry. This study aimed to explain students' ability to read and interpret graphs in chemistry learning on the reaction rate subject. The method used in this research was descriptive qualitative. The data used in this study came from various sources such as journals, books, proceedings, internet and observations. The result showed that using chemistry module based multi representation in learning chemistry could improve the understanding of chemical concepts and students' ability to read and interpret graphs.

AB The purpose of this study is to show that ethnomathematics has an important role in people's daily communication. This study discusses the exploration of existing symbolic measuring instruments used by the Cigugur indigenous community in their daily activities. The research uses a phenomenological approach that can strengthen the study of a comprehensive analytical framework in describing experiences experienced by people based on phenomena. Meanwhile, ethnomathematics design adopts four elements consisting of generic questions, initial answers, critical constructs, and specific activities. Research findings show that people are accustomed to using symbolic measuring instruments rather than formal measuring instruments. Through the use of assumptions, researchers describe and demonstrate the relevance of symbolic measuring instruments with formal instruments that are internationally recognized. The results showed that the indigenous communities of Cigugur possessed and applied ethnomathematics in their lives for generations, so it can be concluded that ethnomathematics is part of their lives and cultural roots which are included in the language system in the universal cultural elements.

AB The ability of Single Point Moored Downwind platforms to align with the main wind direction, depends on the floater and wind turbine design. When co-directionality between wind, waves and current exists, there is no external loading that can difficult the floater alignment. On the other hand, when certain metocean conditions take place, such as a crosscurrent, a misaligning force can prevent the floater to face towards the main wind direction.
   In this study, the PivotBuoy floater is used to evaluate the Single Point Moored platform's ability to align with the main wind direction. The platform dynamics are assessed under irregular wind and wave conditions for current speeds ranging from 0.1 m/s to 1.5 m/s for different wind-current alignments. Two solutions for improving the platform alignment are presented and compared against the baseline case, for the extreme and unusual condition where the platform is operating with a crosscurrent of 90 degrees and 0.4 m/s. Both proposed strategies, an active, based on Individual Pitch Control, and a passive where a static nacelle yaw offset is used, are able to reduce the mean alignment to be within 0.8 degrees compared to the baseline case of 18.7 degrees . The preliminary analysis show promising results for the proposed solutions but need to be further investigated in detail.

AB Structure sense is the ability of students to see any relation between symbols, to manipulate, and to use algebraic structures. This is considered an important ability for students as algebra is the core topic within high school mathematics. An important skills need to be acquired by students in algebra is solving equations, such as solving quadratic equations. To address this, this research aims to understand students' structure sense ability by investigating strategies used in solving quadratic equations of the form of a square of difference of two variables. To reach these aims, a qualitative descriptive method was conducted in the form of four quadratic equation tasks done by twelve Senior High School Students from one of senior high schools in Bandung. In this study, each student was required to work on each task using two different strategies if possible. The result from the students' answers informed that the majority used structure sense strategy. However, there were mistakes conducted by fifty percent and more students completing both the procedural and structure sense strategy. In conclusion, we found out that students' structure sense ability is good despite students experienced some difficulties, whether they used the procedural strategy or involved their structure sense.

AB The physics of wind turbine wakes on fixed foundations have been extensively studied through numerical modelling and measurements over the recent decades. While research initiatives in the field of floating wind turbines have increased significantly, various aspects characterising floating turbine wakes are still not well understood. This paper applies a free-wake vortex model to derive the geometric characteristics of the wake of a surging rotor under axial and yawed rotor conditions. The study examines the influence of platform motion on the wake boundaries and centreline up to four rotor diameters downstream. It is shown that floating turbine wakes experience a higher degree of perturbation as compared to those of fixed turbines. This is highly dependent on the sea state and suggests the need to develop new analytical wake models for the wind industry that are able to account the effect of platform motion on wake behaviour.

ID K-EPSILON MODEL
AB Wind turbine interaction in wind farms can lead to energy loss and increased wind turbine loads, with the magnitude of these effects strongly depending on atmospheric conditions. One-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models are able to represent the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) over a range of model fidelity, and can be used for steady-state inflow profiles in three-dimensional RANS simulations of wind farms. In the present work, an overview of existing and recently developed atmospheric inflow models is presented. The inflow models are applied to separately demonstrate impacts on the velocity deficit of a row of ten wind turbines, due to: turbulence intensity and atmospheric stability in the atmospheric surface layer; ABL depth; and Coriolis-induced veer.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB The discovery of the ipRGCs was thought to fully explain the mechanism behind the relationship between light and effects beyond vision such as alertness. However, this relationship turned out to be more complicated. The current paper describes, by using personal lighting conditions in a field study, further exploration of the relationship between light and subjective alertness during daytime. Findings show that this relationship is highly dependent on the individual. Although nearly all dose-response curves between personal lighting conditions and subjective alertness determined in this study turned out to be not significant, the results may be of high importance in the exploration of the exact relationship.

AB The application of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) algorithms in building energy management systems (BEMS) has great potential to increase the efficiency of building energy systems (BES). The usage of supervised learning algorithms requires time series depicting both nominal and component faulty behaviour for their training. In this paper, we introduce a method that automates Modelica code extension of BES models in Python with fault models to approximate real component faults. The application shows two orders of magnitude faster implementation compared to manual modelling, while no errors occur in the connections between fault and component models.

ID WETTABILITY
AB One of the biggest applications that are coming with the Internet of Things (IoT) are miniaturized sensor networks that connect wirelessly to each other and the internet. Microsupercapacitors (MSCs) are ideal to power these devices, with large cyclability and lifetime. Porous carbons are the material of choice for these devices, but their morphology and manufacturing are far from optimized Vertically oriented graphene MSCs have shown great promise due to their high specific surface areas and conductivity. In this work, the growth of vertically aligned carbon nanosheets (CNS) on 2-inch wafers has been studied, and it has been used as active material to manufacture MSC and transmission line model (TLM) wafers. The fabricated CNS MSC devices show a capacitance of 7.4 mu f (50.7 mu F/cm(2), normalized to the area of the electrodes), a five-times increase from previous results obtained by the group.

AB Early design phase provides the highest potential for saving emissions and energy. Building Information Modeling (BIM) in cooperation with environmental assessment can be efficient tools for various kinds of analysis. This paper shows a possible workflow of using data from BIM in an online form for an early building assessment. Different methods of data export are also described. Czech national methodology, SBToolCZ was used for this study. However, the described principles are applicable for any other commonly used method. Results show approximately 60% of precision compared to the full SBToolCZ assessment (depends on the building typology). As an outcome of the study, a free online tool for architects and public usage is being developed.

AB In this work, the phenomena of electromigration in samples of HTSC tapes of the 2nd generation was investigated. Samples of REBa2Cu3O7-x (REBCO, where RE is a rare earth element) were used in the form of a copper-plated tape. A superconducting bridge was preliminarily formed on the surface of the tape by the method of chemical etching (to decrease the total value of critical current). The sample was exposed by a direct current of I = 0.9I(c). The duration of exposure was up to 350 hours. The value of the current density in the area of the bridge was J = 1.38x10(10)A/m(2). The measurements were carried out at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). The influence of the electric current flow on the value of the sample critical current is controlled at the selected time intervals. The experiment showed high stability of the tape under the specified conditions.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB This study discusses the interplays between urban form and energy performance using a case study in Singapore. We investigate educational urban quarters in the tropical climate of Singapore using simulation-based parametric geometric modelling. Three input variables of urban form were examined: street network orientation, street canyon width, and building depth. In total, 280 scenarios were generated using a quasi-Monte Carlo Saltelli sampler and Grasshopper. For each scenario, the City Energy Analyst, an open-source urban building energy simulation program, calculated solar energy penetration. To assess the variables' importance, we applied Sobol' sensitivity analysis. Results suggest that the street width and building depth were the most influential parameters.

AB Thermal convection of a liquid in a simply connected horizontal cylindrical layer rotating at a variable velocity is investigated experimentally. The inner boundary of the layer has a higher temperature. The cavity rotates rapidly and the liquid is stably stratified in a centrifugal force field. The parameters of the experiment correspond to the conditions when inertial waves are not excited (the modulation frequency is more than twice the cavity rotation frequency). The excitation thresholds of thermal convection and the structure of convective flows are studied depending on the rotation velocity and the parameters of the rotational vibrations of the cavity. It is found that the thermal convection is excited in a threshold way and its excitation is not associated with the manifestation of the mechanism of pendulum vibrational convection. A system of toroidal rolls with a spatial period commensurate with the layer thickness is observed in the cavity.

AB In the present work, our research is focused on an innovative compact all-fiber-optic structure suitable for the development of fully integrated dye lasers. The structure is based on a standard fiber-optic glass ferrule with two parallel openings along its length with diameters of 125 mu m. A Fabry-Perot cavity is formed in one of the openings using two fused silica optical fibers with flat end facets. An angle-polished optical fiber with a reflective metal coating is placed in the second opening through which the active medium is pumped transversely. The active medium used is the Rhodamine 6G dye dissolved in glycerine, which is pumped by the 337.1-nm wavelength laser pulses of a nitrogen TEA laser. The ferrule-based design allows for a simplified set-up procedure and the integration of the pumping system to the basic structure of the laser, thus making it very compact. The design of the light source presented allows its future use in applications, such as lab-on-a-fiber, lab-on-a-chip and total analysis micro systems.

AB The steady time-averaged flows in a rotating system of immiscible fluids are studied experimentally. The fluids fill a horizontal cylindrical container and are brought into a centrifuged state, when a less dense fluid forms a cylindrical core, and a denser fluid is distributed in the form of a coaxial layer. Under the action of the gravity field, the core is steadily displaced along the radius in such a way that its axis is oriented parallel to the container axis and remains stationary in the laboratory frame of reference. In the frame rotating with the container, the core and the fluid surrounding it oscillate. This leads to the generation of a steady flow in the form of differential rotation of the fluid with respect to the container. To study the structure of the flow, light-scattering tracers of neutral buoyancy are added to the liquid. The flow rate is calculated from their displacement. Measurements show that at the interface, from the side of the external fluid, a Stokes boundary layer is formed, at the boundaries of which a tangential discontinuity of the averaged velocity is formed.

AB The goal of this research is to develop ecologically and economically optimized implementation strategies for social housing. Therefore, a case study is analysed over its life cycle using life cycle assessments (LCA) and life cycle costs (LCC) regarding the global warming potential (GWP) and its environmental impact costs (cost per ton of CO2). The case study is optimized regarding the embodied emissions of construction and energy demand during its use stage. Considering the cost ceiling for social housing, it is evident, that an implementation of renewable materials and energies is mandatory in order to prevent the risk of a project failure due to excessive environmental impact costs.

AB The experimental and theoretical analysis of thermodynamical peculiarities of heat flux at the fatigue crack tip during its propagation was made in presented work. The goal is to elucidate the relation between heat flow at the crack tip and kinetic of fatigue crack propagation for different loading conditions. The plane specimens with notch made from stainless steel (AISI 304) were studied. There were two types of specimens for uniaxial loading and one type for biaxial loading. A heat dissipation during fatigue crack propagation was measured by simultaneous use of contact and noncontact techniques. The samples were subject to cyclic loading with constant stress amplitude and different biaxial coefficients. The functional dependence between crack propagation and heat flow at the crack tip was received by experiment measurement and analytical calculation. This relation depends on only type of material and righty for all fracture mode.

ID ENERGY HUB; OPTIMIZATION
AB This paper demonstrates the impact of demand response (DR) on optimal multi-energy systems (MES) design with building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) on roofs and facades. Building loads and solar potentials are assessed using bottom-up models; the MES design is determined using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model (energy hub). A mixed-use district of 170,000 m(2) floor area including office, residential, retail, education, etc. is studied under current and future climate conditions in Switzerland and Singapore. Our findings are consistent with previous studies, which indicate that DR generally leads to smaller system capacities due to peak shaving. We further show that in both the Swiss and Singapore context, cost and emissions of the MES can be reduced significantly with DR. Applying DR, the optimal area for BIPV placement increases only marginally for Singapore (similar to 1%), whereas for Switzerland, the area is even reduced by 2-8%, depending on the carbon target. In conclusion, depending on the context, DR can have a noticeable impact on optimal MES and BIPV capacities and should thus be considered in the design of future, energy efficient districts.

AB The spatio-temporal patterns of the existing rooftop photovoltaic (PV) production can provide valuable insights for the design of effective strategies for PV integration at large scale. In this work, we quantify the hourly production of existing rooftop PV installations by combining two large-scale methods, for detecting rooftop solar panels and for estimating their hourly PV generation, which are both applicable at the Swiss national scale. A validation against measured data of PV installations from 16 roofs in the Swiss Canton of Aargau shows that the existing PV area is detected accurately, while the hourly profiles overestimate the PV production, with higher errors in winter than in summer. These errors result in a mean overestimation of the annual PV production by 16%, assuming a triangular panel placement at low tilt (15 degrees) on flat roofs.

AB The increasing use of ground-source heat pumps (GSHPs) for heating and cooling of buildings raises questions regarding the technical potential of GSHPs and their impact on the temperature in the shallow subsurface. In this paper, we develop a method using Machine Learning to estimate the technical potential of shallow GSHPs, which enables such an estimation for Switzerland with limited data and computational resources. A training dataset is constructed based on meteorological and geological data across Switzerland. We analyse correlations and the importance of each of the input data for estimating the GSHP potential and compare different input feature sets and Machine Learning models. The Random Forest algorithm, trained on the full dataset, provides the best performance to estimate the GSHP potential. The resulting model yields an R-2 score of 0.95 for the annual energy potential, 0.86 for the heat extraction rate, and 0.82 for the potential number of boreholes per GSHP system.

AB To decrease greenhouse gas emissions of the Swiss building stock, effective retrofit strategies are necessary. Due to the long-term operation of buildings, future developments and uncertainties need to be considered, which calls for assessing the robustness of retrofit decisions. Existing studies propose robustness metrics for decisions under deep uncertainty to be coupled with a scenario-based simulation approach. We review these metrics and present a simulation approach that includes current and future operational energy, emissions, and costs. We apply the seven identified metrics to retrofit decisions of a multifamily house located in Zurich, where future scenarios in terms of climate, occupancy, decarbonization, and cost development are included. The metrics are based on different assumptions and positions towards risk. We further find that the discriminatory power is different, confirming the Minimax Regret metric to be most suitable for the building context when looking at individual buildings. For the case study, we find that deep retrofit seems to be a robust decision from an environmental perspective. From a cost perspective, the electrification of the heating system with heat pumps and the installation of PV without a complete envelope retrofit proves to be most robust.

AB Increasingly complex concepts for the heating and cooling supply of buildings require both intelligent and transparent operational management strategies. One way of sequencing and coordinating different generator components is to include information about heat flows on the consumption side. In addition to heat meters, modern pumps also provide heat flow detection. The present study compares the heat flow detection via heat meters and pumps for multiple hydraulic circuits in the operating phase of a large industrial demonstration object. In particular, the influence of typical errors in the installation of the temperature measurement and their elimination are quantified.

AB Enhancement and non-monotonic field dependence of critical current density (J(c)), called anomalous peak effect, were observed in Ba1-xKxFe2As2 with splayed columnar defects. In principle, anisotropy of in-plane J(c) should be present in this superconductor since the introduced splayed columnar defects introduce anisotropy in the plane. This study reports in-plane anisotropy of J(c) observed in 2.6 GeV U irradiated Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 with splay angles of +/- 15 degrees and +/- 20 degrees. Results show that J(c) component parallel to the splay plane is larger than the perpendicular component, and the parallel component contribute to the anomalous peak effect at around B Phi/3 more.

AB Students have many difficulties in constructing proof of the statement, plus the Covid-19 pandemic conditions, students study at home. For that, we need media that help the student's difficulties in constructing proof while studying at home. This study aims to describe the ability of students during the Covid-19 pandemic in constructing proof of group problems, after being given the media scaffolding worksheets. The trial was conducted online, after learning the exercises were given evidentiary problems through scaffolding worksheets with the topic Group. To find out the ability to construct a proof, test, and interview are given based on the student's proof answers. Interview guidelines are prepared to refer to indicators of construction proof. For this reason, this research is qualitative descriptive research. The research subjects were students of Unirow Tuban Mathematics education who took the Algebra Structure course. The design of scaffolding worksheets refers to the mapping of construction evidence indicators, and the level of scaffolding developed by [32]. The results showed that the ability of students in the initial steps of proof, proof of flow, using related concepts, the argument of proof, and the language of proof had very good improvement. So the ability of students to prove group problems after using scaffolding worksheets increased.

AB The purpose of this study was to analyze students' problem solving skills in work and energy material using the RACH model. The method in this study was a descriptive method using survey techniques. The instrument used is a problem solving test. Tests were given to 253 students from eighth grade in junior high schools in Banjarmasin randomly selected. The RASCH model was used as a processing stage of data from raw data into logit numbers that provided information related to infit, outfit and unidimensionality using a winstep program to achieve this goal. This study investigated the quality of person measure, person reliability, and variable map. The results of the analysis are based on the RASCH model with the Mean Square Statistics (MNSQ) value is 0.95, Z Standard (ZSTD) is 0.0, pearson reliability is 0.77, and cronbach alpha (KR-20) person raw score test reliability is 0.86. Lower logits manifests students with lower ability. This proved that the students' problem solving skills was absolutely poor. Students' problem solving skills need to be improved through classroom learning in future research.

AB Given the large impact that the spectrum and intensity of light can have on people's health and well-being, it is of fundamental importance to understand the properties of light received under normal living conditions. Historically, as research into the biological responses of light has traditionally focused on laboratory studies with controlled lighting conditions, little is known about people's light exposure outside of experimental environments. Spectrace is the first wearable compressive spectrometer designed for continuous spectral light tracking in everyday environments. This paper presents the sensor and its evaluation based on wearability considerations and three performance criteria: 1) its accuracy (in terms of spectral sensing capability), 2) its reliability (notably as far as directional response is concerned), and 3) its adaptability to the large dynamics of ambient conditions. Results show the potential use of the newly developed sensor for chronobiological studies and beyond.

ID DESIGN
AB Machine learning-based surrogate models are trained on building energy simulation input and output data. Their key advantage is their computational speed allowing them to produce building performance estimates in fractions of a second. In this work we showcase the use of deep convolutional neural network surrogate models embedded into a web application, allowing users to rapidly explore building performance at high spatio-temporal resolution. Users can pick any climate on an interactive map, customize a building design with thirteen decisive design parameters, and the surrogate model allows them to retrieve hourly heating and cooling load time series data in fractions of a second.
   In this work, we further show that the surrogate model reaches an accuracy of R-2 > 0.93 (MAE < 0.27 kWh) for unseen design specifications and climates. These results motivate the use of computationally cheap surrogate models to replace building energy simulation for a wide variety of tasks in the future.

AB One of the abilities that must be developed in 21st century learning is think creatively. The ability to think creatively is part of creativity that involves developing ideas and products the problems solve. This study aims to analyze the creative thinking skills of vocational students on waste treatment materials by applying project-based learning (PjBL). The study used weak experimental method by using one group pretest-posttest design. The subject of study was grade 10th students at one private high school in Cianjur. Data collection of students' creative thinking used essay test. Essay test of creative thinking ability consists of five indicators namely (1) fluency, (2) flexibility, (3) originality, (4) elaboration, and (5) sensitivity to problem. The result shows that the highest gain score was fluency, with gain score of 12 and the lowest gain score obtained by sensitivity to problem with gain score of 5. The effectiveness of PjBL was seen from index N-gain with a medium category (0.40). The finding revealed that PjBL is quite influential in improving the students creative thinking abilities, especially in contextual teaching material such as waste management learning.

AB Chemistry learning that has been going on all this time is still monotonous, where the teacher explains the materials which are then followed by giving assignments. This learning has not been able to improve students' learning outcomes effectively. The loading of case studies into chemistry textbooks is one of the efforts to improve students' learning outcomes. This study aimed to describe the effectiveness of the case study-based chemistry learning textbook in improving students' learning outcomes. The type of research carried out is a quasi-experiment. The population of this study was the eleventh-grade students of Natural Sciences at SMAN 6 Denpasar Bali. The samples were selected by cluster sampling technique to obtain a control group and an experimental group. Students in the control class were taught with the conventional chemistry learning textbook, while students in the experimental group were taught with the case study-based chemistry learning textbook. Data of students' learning outcomes were collected by a test. Data were then analyzed by using statistics of analysis of covariance. The results of this study indicated that the case study-based chemistry learning textbook was more effective in improving the students' learning outcomes than the conventional chemistry learning textbook.

AB This study aimed to describe the differences in students' learning outcomes using the multiple representation-based chemistry learning textbook and the conventional chemistry learning textbook. This study was a quasi-experimental research. The population of this study was eight classes of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at SMAN 4 Denpasar Bali Indonesia. The samples were selected by cluster sampling technique to determine a control and an experimental group. Students in the control group were taught by the conventional chemistry learning textbook, while students in the experimental group were taught by the multiple representation-based chemistry learning textbook. The data in the study were students' learning outcomes. These data were analyzed using the analysis of covariance statistics. Results of the study showed that there was a significant difference in learning outcomes between students taught by the multiple representation-based chemistry learning textbook and those taught by the conventional chemistry learning textbook. From the mean of learning outcome scores, it could be concluded that the students' learning outcomes who were taught by the multiple representation-based chemistry learning textbook were better than those of the conventional chemistry learning textbook.

AB Ketoprofen nanoparticles can be used to make a controlled ketoprofen delivery system. The material composition and method of making nanoparticles used had an effect on the formation of ketoprofen nanoparticles. This study aims to obtain the optimized results of each response responses by varying the sonication time, alginate concentration, and concentration of tween 80 and characterizing the ketoprofen encapsulation efficiency, nanoparticle size, and homogeneity level. Ketoprofen nanoparticles are made by ultrasonication method. The encapsulation efficiency of ketoprofen was evaluated using UV-Vis spectrophotometry analysis, while the size of the nanoparticles were evaluated using particle size analyzer (PSA). The optimum condition of the response was predicted at sonicaton time of 18.41 minutes with alginate and tween 80 concentrations of 1% (w/v) and 3% (v/v) respectively. The optimized results of each response is predicted to be around 21,412 +/- 8.78% for encapsulation efficiency, particle size around 650,056 +/- 284.47 nm, and homogeneity level (PdI) around 0.623 +/- 0.10. The resulting equation can be used to determine the optimum value of encapsulation efficiency and particle size in the sonication time range 10 - 30 minutes, the concentration of alginate 0.2 - 1%, and the concentration of tween 80 1 - 3%.

AB The highest share of the global population lives in cities. The current configuration of the latter requires considerable amounts of resource flows causing the degradation of local and global ecosystems. To face the complexity of these challenges, scientists use the concept of urban metabolism (UM), i.e. measuring urban input and output flows from a systemic perspective. This accounting method results in a large data collection from multiple sources that are often not harmonised. Metabolism of Cities Data Hub is an online platform which facilitates data collection, processing and visualisation in order to extract urban metabolism insights. This work highlights the challenges faced when mining urban metabolism data in the case of Lausanne and Geneva, as well as provides insights on how data could be best used from users and providers. Slight differences between the two case studies, in terms of data accessibility and availability where experienced but the main challenges revolved around data copyright, format and availability. As a conclusion, the used tool can enable harmonisation and standardisation of UM data. As such it could contribute to the use of data mining to streamline the environmental monitoring of cities as well as facilitate the creation of mitigation strategies.

AB This study aims to identify students' conception and their level of representation on wave concepts. This is descriptive research. Data were collected through a five-tiers instrument test. Subjects in this study were thirty 9th grades in one of Junior High School in Bandung. The results of the study show that there are many students who lack knowledge and misconceptions. Students' visual representation in wave concepts in real life is only at the macroscopic level. Their drawing in connecting phenomena and real-life also have some errors. Multiple representations-based learning is needed to facilitate students changing their conceptions into scientific and deep conceptions, which not only focus on representations modal such as verbal, picture, mathematic, and graph, but also level of representations, such as macroscopic, microscopic, sub-microscopic and symbolic.

AB This paper explores the trade-off between redeveloping an urban site with higher density and maintaining solar access for the surrounding context in the hot and dry climate of Tel Aviv. Such trade-offs are important for future urban development in the Middle East, where densification is a demographic and environmental need. We explore this trade-off with multiobjective optimization (MOO). Specifically, we benchmark seven MOO algorithms on two test problems with different, parametric typologies: courtyard and high-rise. For both problems, we aim to maximize Floor Area Ratio and the simulation-based Context Exposure Index, a novel metric based on the Israeli green building code. The high-rise emerges as the better performing typology, and HypE, SPEA2, and RBFMOpt as the most efficient and robust MOO algorithms.

DE model-based dynamic calibration; Monte Carlo; parameter identification
AB High-g shock accelerometers usually use model-based dynamic calibration to obtain their dynamic characteristics. Starting from the dynamic calibration technology chain, a different model linearization algorithm from ISO16063-43 is used for accelerometer model establishment and parameter identification, and the Monte Carlo method is used to calculate the uncertainty of model parameters. In order to verify the proposed method, simulated signals were constructed under different shock excitation amplitudes, and the parameter identification and uncertainty evaluation were done on the simulated signals to verify the proposed algorithm. At the same time, the algorithm is tested by using the actual shock accelerometer calibration signal. The results show that the algorithm has achieved good results without increasing the amount of calculation, and has practical significance for the dynamic calibration of accelerometers and other sensors in practical engineering applications.

AB Rotating machine applications with superconductors attract much interest in the industry. For maintaining the operating temperature of high-temperature superconductor (HTS) field poles, a sophisticated cooling system is required. A thermosyphon (TS) is one of the ways for this purpose. The cryo-mechanical system composition is relatively simple, lightweight, and based on natural convection therefore not using any mechanical pump. It can supply the refrigerant from the static condenser part to the rotating evaporator part by using a successful rotary joint. The operating temperature of the TS cooling system depends on the refrigerant. Considering the current HTS materials, the suitable refrigerant is neon, hydrogen. Nitrogen which provides a higher operating temperature than neon and hydrogen is employed for future development. In this work, we focused on and investigated the heat transfer capacity of TS using nitrogen as the refrigerant. The heat transfer performance with rotating was also studied. As a result of the experiment, the TS cooling system could maintain the evaporator temperature by rotating. Moreover, it could transfer the 90 W heat load with rotating.

AB Traceable measurement problems have always been difficult in dynamic pressure calibration. The dynamic pressure measurement method by laser interferometer based on refractive index is studied for micro sinusoidal pressure calibration. The linear relationship between the pressure and the refractive index is verified by the refractive index model of water and air and the static pressure experiments. Based on the in-situ calibration method and the optical multiplier the measurement method is preliminary applied on the micro sinusoidal pressure calibration device with air. The main influencing factors such as the temperature's change and the glass window's movement were quantified, the advantages and disadvantages of water and air used as the pressure medium were compared, and the follow-up research direction is further clarified.

AB A city district in Suzhou aims to develop a progressive, long-term sustainable energy strategy. This study examines possible energy planning pathways for the district through the development of a long-term optimization model and a range of energy scenarios until 2050. The scenarios explore different CO2 emission reduction strategies and technology mixes/parameters. Results suggest which low-carbon energy conversion technologies and efficiency measures should be adopted by the district alongside supportive local policies and targets. Photovoltaic (PV) and waste energy converters are two renewable energy technologies which are taken up at maximum possible rates in the evaluated scenarios to reduce long-term CO2 emissions. Once local renewable resources are exhausted, natural gas-based combined-cycle plants (CCP) and combined heat and power plants (CHP) are required to further reduce emissions, alongside efficiency measures in the built environment. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies also demonstrate the potential to drastically reduce emissions; however, local feasibility studies are needed to support their implementation. Study results prescribe renewable energy share and CO2 emission reduction targets until 2050 for the district. Appropriate local policy and planning targets should also be accompanied by supplementary support studies, including local feasibility, renewable energy resource, and demand-side management studies.

AB The large-scale deployment of smart meters has led to significant amount of electricity demand data available, driving it into the realm of Big Data. It is a major challenge to exploit this Big Data in order to characterise electricity use patterns and to support demand response policies. In this paper, we perform a featured-based cluster analysis on nine building archetypes (hospitals, schools, offices, hotels, flats, houses etc.) to identify electricity use patterns. Then, four metrics are developed, which are entropy, load curviness, peak intensity and index of hourly ramp rates, to measure these archetypes' suitability to be involved in demand response schemes. A significant difference in electricity use patterns between the archetypes is found, as well as among the seasons and days of the week. We present a number of metrics for each archetype to establish which type of archetype should be prioritised for demand response programmes in terms of peak management, ramp rates as well as demand flexibility. A key finding of our study is that households offer more demand flexibility than the non-domestic sector and should therefore be incentivized to participate in dynamic electricity tariffs.

AB When students learn to solve a problem in mathematics, they often face difficulties and challenges. The positive attitude of students in dealing and overcoming various problems that arise is known as mathematical resilience. Students with good mathematical resilience will be tough in solving various problems and will certainly get good learning outcomes. This study aims to analyze the variables that form the mathematical resilience of high school students. The subjects in this study were 110 high school students. The method used in this study is a quantitative descriptive method using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) techniques. Each respondent is given a mathematical resilience scale consisting of 25 statements which are the variables forming the mathematical resilience. The findings in this study indicate that seven main indicators that form mathematical resilience can be formulated in high school students. Each indicator is composed of several variables which are the constituent variables of the mathematical resilience ability. These indicators can be used as a foundation for further study of the mathematical resilience analysis of high school students.

AB We study three-dimensional structures of vortices in a type. superconductor under a magnetic field by solving the Ginzburg-Landau equations. First, we show under a perpendicular magnetic field, two vortices are almost parallel but bend toward the center of superconductor due to the Meissner current. Second, we show under a tilted magnetic field, two vortices enter the superconductor from edge to edge and they are parallel to the magnetic field.

AB Laser Doppler Vibrometers (LDV) are used as an optical measurement instrument for measuring vibrations with high measurement accuracy. Nowadays, the carrier-to-noise-density ratio (C/N-0) of the optical signal is limited with a maximum C/N-0 of 168 dB/Hz. However, due to the noise of electronic devices and the digitizer, the final digital signal has a lower carrier-to-noise ratio than the optical signal, therefore, the expected resolution of the demodulation results cannot be obtained. In order for the sampled signal to maintain the C/N-0 of the optical signal, the signal needs to be amplified. However, because of the saturation characteristics of the amplifier, choosing a large amplification will lead to clipping. To investigate the impact of a clipped LDV signals, this paper demonstrates mathematically that, for signals with small phase modulation, clipping does not affect the sidebands of the signal. Therefore, a large amplification can lead to a higher power of the sidebands in the digital signal and thus obtain a higher sideband-to-noise ratio. Meanwhile, the results of mathematical derivation prove that the amplitude of the carrier is lost after clipping. Therefore, the demodulation results of the clipped PM signal are incorrect for small phase modulation. In this paper, the simulation of the error of the demodulation results is given for different vibration amplitudes of the measured objects and different amplification.

AB Spatial Visual, a mental representation in depicting visual information, is one of important ability in solving geometry problems. This study aimed to investigate student spatial visual ability and analyze it by gender. A total of participant involved in this research was 30 junior high school students at grade seven. There were three steps in this research. First, we chose two reflection questions from spatial visual assessment by Ramful, Lowrie, and Logan. Next, we interviewed some of students by semi structure interviewed. Finally, we analyzed student spatial visual comparing to types of visualization by Hegarty and Kozhevnicov and analyzed by gender. We found that generally the students had a lack in spatial visual ability because their pictorial representation, however boys had better spatial visual ability than girls.

AB Visualization is a mental act representing a visual information. In solving geometry problem, we need visualization to identify and illustrate the information. This study aimed to analyse student visualization in solving the reflection problems. We studied a female high school athlete at grade eleven. There were three steps in this study. First, we designed two reflection problems. Next, we assessed and interviewed her by semi structure interviewed. Finally, we analysed student spatial visual comparing to types of visualization by Presmeg. Lot of athletes do not have time enough in learning about some topic in their class, so we have to find an appropriate approach to led her in learning activity for creating an efective learning. We found that she has two types of visualization that are pattern imagery and kinaesthetic imagery. In the future, we can design instructional tasks that are convenient for this visualizer.

One of the things that affect students" problem solving ability is adversity quotient (AQ). Method used in this research is descriptive qualitative with subjects as many as 3 students of class XI majoring in Light Vehicle Engineering at SMK S Muhamadiyah Salatiga. The selection of subjects uses purposive sampling with the instrument of problem solving ability based on Polya and AQ questionnaire. Data validity uses data triangulation methods. This research uses data analysis in the form of data collection, data reduction, data presentation and drawing conclusions. The result of this research indicate students with the type of quitters are able to carry out the step to understand the problem. Students with AQ type campers are able to carry out the steps of understanding the problem, planning solution and carrying out a plan of resolution. Climbers type students are able to carry out step to understand the problem, plan the completion, carry out the settlement and check again.

The instrument used in this study was HOTS which consisted of 24 multiple choice items that had met validity and reliability criteria. The data of students' HOTS was obtained from pre-test and post-test scores. The analysis technique was in the form of gain and effect size test as well as prerequisite test and hypothesis testing. The analysis results showed differences in the experimental class average post-test scores were 66.52 +/- SD 17.69 and the control class was 42.01 +/- SD 22.55, the experimental class gain score was 0.58 (medium) and the control class was 0.24 (low) and the experimental class effect size was 2.39 (high) and the control class was 0.53 (medium). The result of normality and homogeneity test of HOTS data showed normal and homogeneous results so that it could be proceed with hypothesis testing through t test. The result of the t-test analysis with a significant value (2 tailed) was 0.00 less than 0.05 or there were significant differences. It can be inferred that HOTS taught by students through blended learning is better than conventional models.

AB This study aims to improve students' Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) through the use of e-learning. The type of research used is Participatory Action Research (PAR) which refers to the Davison, Martinsons & Kock model. The subjects used were 11 students majoring in Department of Physics Education at the Universitas Papua who programmed basic physics courses with two lecturers as instructors. The students consisted of 6 female and 5 male, with an average age of 19 years. The research instruments are in the form of HOTS questions and online questionnaires about the effectivity and practicality of using e-learning. Students' HOTS assessment were done authentically and holistically by looking at the various effects of optimizing the use of e-learning that can improve student HOTS. The results showed that the use of e-learning media consisting of various supporting devices such as modules, animation, simulation, multimedia, and online virtual laboratories could increase students HOTS. Students give agreeing responses to the use of e-learning media. It can be concluded that e-learning can improve HOTS 'ability and students agree the learning process. This study's recommendations are the need for sufficient internet access and affordable fees, especially for students.

AB Porphyrins used as photosensitizers are accumulated selectively in glioblastoma cells due to the latter heme metabolism disorders and could be used effectively for intraoperative fluorescence staining of the tumor formation and differentiation from normal brain parenchyma. The aim of this work was to investigate the photodynamic properties of 5-ALA/PpIX on stem cell cultures isolated from glioblastoma. Supernatant samples of photosensitizer-treated cell lines were used for evaluation of photosensitizers' accumulation in the cell lines investigated using excitation in the spectral ranges of Soret' band (360 - 410 nm) and Q-band (600 - 650 nm). The emission detected was used to evaluate the efficacy of the photodynamic treatment during PDT irradiation inducing apoptosis and necrosis processes in cell lines treated with photosensitizers. Several variables were studied, such as histochemical and genetic variants of glioblastoma, and various photosensitizers' concentrations and light-emitting parameters. The results of this in vitro work will be used as the basis for a further in vivo application on animal models of glioblastoma with applying irradiation using intracranial light sources and for a subsequent transfer of the obtained protocols of photodynamic treatment of glioblastoma lesions in such model systems for the needs of human medicine.

AB To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the efficiency of energy supply systems must be increased, for example, using renewable energy sources. Since the generation of renewable energy can depend on weather conditions and other parameters, the use of short- or long-term energy storage enables an increase in the covered building energy demand. Due to the large number of available technologies for renewable energy generation and storage, it is possible to combine these systems into different energy supply concepts. By optimizing and comparing the designed concepts, the most suitable one can be determined with respect to the current and future investments. A comprehensive comparison of energy supply concepts must include both economic and energy evaluation criteria. This study focuses on parametric numerical simulations to identify economically feasible and sustainable energy supply concepts for a practical case of new residential buildings. The results show that electrical storage and on-site power generation can provide the greatest benefits. In contrast, large thermal storage systems are not economically viable.

AB This study aims to synthesize and characterize chitosan beads using the Fourier Tranform Infra Red (FTIR) spectrophotometer. The test was carried out by making chitosan beads by mixing chitosan and 0.1 M acetic acid and dropping it into 0.1 M NaOH solution to form gel beads. Based on the results of the study obtained the value of the degree of deacetylation of chitosan by 76.85% and chitosan beads by 89.32%. While the characterization of chitosan beads based on FTIR spectrophotometer showed a difference in the peak absorption of NH3 at wave number 1450.47 cm(-1) with a slightly wider band on the chitosan beads while the sharp NH2 absorption band appeared in the region of 1435.04 cm(-1) in chitosan. And there is an absorption peak in the region of 570.93 cm(-1) which is the KBR absorption peak used as pellets in chitosan samples.

AB Parabolic Trough Concentrators (PTC) are the most common solar concentrators. However, the high cost of production, operation, sun-tracking system, and the environmental sensitivity made them unprofitable for urban contexts. Lenses are more efficient and effective, but the complexity of manufacturing made them less used in sustainable architecture. This research proposes a liquid lens to be integrated into buildings' envelope and compared with a PTC based on the energy production and reduced CO2 emissions over a year. The output energy, temperature, and efficiency of concentrator are obtained by the physics of light equations, and Ray-tracing software simulation. The results show that water lenses are at least 6% more efficient, their output temperature is higher, their underneath greenhouse effect made them less sensitive to the environment, and are still productive in high latitudes where PTCs are not operative. The paper presents the full result of the research that was registered as a patent.

AB Assessing the potential of renewable energy sources for buildings in neighborhoods becomes a crucial task in the early planning stage. Integrating solar energy equipment into urban buildings poses many challenges, such as uncertainties and the complexity of urban built agglomeration. Due to the time-consuming solar energy potential assessment process and lack of knowledge of urban actors, a reliable framework is required to predict buildings' solar energy potential. This research presents a comprehensive machine learning data processing framework to predict output energy of Water Lenses (WL) based on buildings specifications and relationship to the neighbourhood. The research used a raw dataset consisting of 7000 sample buildings in different situations by applying 12 years of climatic conditions in Tallinn, Estonia. The results were entered into a Supervised Machine Learning process and the Gaussian Naive Bayes technique was used for classification of building features to be implemented with solar systems. Finally, the process was measured by a confusion matrix that showed 80% accuracy of ML output predictions in the urban context.

ID DESIGN
AB In this paper, a plasmonic sensor is proposed based on a metal-insulator-metal waveguide coupled with a double-triangle resonator. The sensing structure is numerically and theoretically investigated using the two-dimensional finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The results show the presence of a linear relationship between the materials refractive indices and the sensor's wavelength resonances. The proposed structure revealed a high sensitivity value, reaching the maximum value for mode 1 S-model = 1374 nm/RIU, and for mode 2 S-mode2 = 2365 nm/RIU. The proposed sensor can be classified as a high-performance nanosensor that can be used to identify different materials.

AB Building energy codes have been implemented in Switzerland as well as across the world to reduce building energy consumption, however, due to the progressive effect of climate change phenomena and the precipitate change in occupancy patterns due to the global pandemic, their effectiveness and limitations must be constantly re-examined. This paper explores the effectiveness of natural ventilation as a passive cooling strategy, as well as the overheating patterns in dwellings across the Swiss territory. The work is based on a climate-based simulation model at a territorial scale, from which the building performance is further analysed considering the heating energy consumption and overheating risk hours above 26.5 degrees C. The effectiveness of natural ventilation through the operable window operable area in reducing overheating risk was also estimated. The results show the effectiveness across the whole territory of the current regulation (SIA 380/1:2016), which is focused on the performance of the building envelope to reduce heat losses. An unattended alarming overheating pattern was spotted in locations with altitudes below 1500 meters as a direct consequence of the climate change phenomena, hence a series of recommendations are proposed to update and improve the current legal requirements.

AB The Continuous Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometry (CSLDV) developed on the base of the galvanometer scanner system has made it possible to quickly obtain the full-field vibration responses within an intact structure without any hole. In order to make CSLDV also suitable for testing structures with arbitrary rectangular holes, a novel method of area-partitioned continuous scanning test and mode reconstruction is further proposed in this paper. In the first step, the surface of a flat plate structure with arbitrary rectangular holes is divided into several rectangular sub regions by an appropriate area-partitioned method, and the operational deflection shape(ODS) of each sub region is obtained by a continuous scanning at constant speed. Then, considering that the ODSs of all sub regions are spliced and the relative phases among them are different, the operational deflection shape of the whole structure is reconstructed based on linear function and other process. Finally, a plate structure with two arbitrary rectangular holes was taken as an example for modal test using the proposed method. At the same time, a validated experiment was performed using the SLDV measurement. The results show the mode shapes derived from the extended CSLDV are in agreement with those from SLDV and the Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) between the two are all greater than 0.95. This method has great potential in practical engineering applications with the advantages of high efficiency and the full-field measurement.

AB Sports health literacy (SHL) is an important indicator of the all-round development of college students. However, the existing studies have not constructed a systematic and complete evaluation index system (EIS) or diversified the index weighting method. To solve the problem, this paper tries to evaluate and predict college students' SHL based on artificial neural network (ANN). Firstly, an EIS was designed for college students' SHL, including 4 goals, and 19 primary indices, and the structure of the evaluation and prediction system was presented for college students' SHL. Next, college students' SHL was comprehensively evaluated through analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Finally, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) was established to predict college students' SHL, and the initial weights were optimized by genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed EIS and prediction model were found scientific and effective through experiments. To sum up, the SHL of college students were evaluated and predicted in the following aspects: EIS construction, evaluation model establishment, and evaluation system design. The proposed model and system can comprehensively rate college students' SHL. The statistical analysis of the ratings reflects the gaps between indices, and identifies those doing well and poorly on each index. Then, pertinent intervention can be implemented to satisfy the actual needs of improving college students' SHL.

AB The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of practicum using inquiry-based laboratories of enzyme kinetics on local material to improve students' critical thinking ability. The inquiry-based laboratory practice of enzyme kinetics has four stages to keep the students' effort on track: pre-lab activities, an in-lab discussion, in-lab work and a post-lab assignment. This study used a quasi-experimental method, with single group pretest-posttest design. The subjects of this study involve 55 students enrolled in biochemistry practicum course from the sixth semester of chemistry study program. The critical thinking ability test instrument consist of 12 reasonable multiple choices question that includes two indicators of critical thinking ability i.e. basic support and inference and also supported by student worksheet. Data analysis of students' score test using t-test. There was a statistically significant improvement of students' critical thinking skills (symp.sig 0.000). Furthermore to see the increase in each students' critical thinking indicator, N-gain is calculated. Based on implementation of the inquiry-based laboratory, it is reported that students' critical thinking skills improved in medium category and also for students' critical thinking indicator of 'inference'. But in the students' critical thinking indicator of `basic support' they get high category.

ID CRUCIATE LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION; INJURY
AB Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) rupture is one of the most common and severe sports injuries among the athletes caused by trauma. The standard treatment for ACL rupture patients is Reconstruction Anterior Cruciate Ligament (RACL) surgery, followed by rehabilitation lasting six to nine months. Consistent post-RACL medical rehabilitation can restore normal knee function. In this study, proposes a real-time simulation of knee joint angle estimation from electromyogram (EMG) signals for medical rehabilitation of RACL patients. Which is the continuation of this program is to be able to create an exoskeleton to increase the consistency and quality of medical rehabilitation of RACL patients. The method used to make this simulation is using LabVIEW software to simultaneous data collection between the EMG signal from the bicep femoralis muscle and the knee angle. The simultaneous data is processed using a Monte Carlo calculation to estimate the knee angle from the EMG signals The LabVIEW simulation shows that the knee angle's estimate was close enough to the measured knee angle and had a small time delay. It can be concluded that simulation of knee angle estimation from the EMG signal produces a good simulation and can be developed to the exoskeleton.

AB A practical method of studying the dynamics of respiratory function associated with the registration of the electrical impedance of conductive biological fluids exhaled by the patient is described. In the model measuring cell, the physical causes and relationships in the conductivity of the air flow, saturated with an electrolytic fluid aerosol created by an ultrasonic nebulizer have been investigated experimentally. The design of a new electrical impedance spirometer in the form of a mouthpiece with electrical sensors, filled with a porous medium impregnated with electrolyte, through which the patient breathes, is developed and tested. To register fluctuations in the magnitude of the impedance modulus, an original hardware and software complex is used, made on the basis of a high-speed analog-to-digital converter. Based on electrical impedance analysis data, the methods are proposed for quantitative assessment of the basic spirometric medical indicators characterizing the state and functioning of the patient's breathing apparatus, such as respiration rate, entry and expiration rate, exhaled air volume, amount and concentration of exhaled lung fluid.

AB Contemporary medicine applies the analysis of molecular composition and physicochemical properties of biological fluids as one of the main tools for diagnostics and control over body state and behaviour of pathological processes. However, most laboratory diagnostics methods (such as biochemical, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, etc.) are too expensive and time-consuming. They demand the availability of well-equipped laboratories, complex equipment, scarce and expensive reactants and materials and the highly skilled medical staff.Compared to them, bioimpedansometry is an incomparably simpler and cheaper method of laboratory research, becoming increasingly popular for diagnosing internal diseases. In the current research the main physical factors responsible for bioelectrical impedance variations in some conductive intracellular and extracellular biological fluids with different protein molecules, cell components and microbes were studied experimentally. The original laboratory impedance meter was developed for investigation of blood or interstitial biological fluids as well as condensates composition in orderto determine the concentration of organic substances in them and the rate of biochemical and immune reactions.

AB The paper presents the results of studies directed toward the determination of physical mechanisms and causal factors responsible for variations in the electrical impedance of the cardiovascular system. Experiments were carried out using the original hydrodynamic apparatus modelling different hemodynamic conditions, i.e., a pulsatile flow in a blood vessel of variable diameter, ramified pulmonary blood flows and the function of a cardiac valve. Computer-assisted signal processing techniques provided measurements of the active and capacitive components of the electrical conductivity with an error not exceeding 0.1%. Impedance values were analyzed for different vessel size and geometry, flow rate, temperature, concentration of ionic and dielectric components in some model biological fluids at different frequencies of the probing alternating current. It has been found that bioimpedance oscillations can be mainly attributed to the local modulations of the diameter of blood vessels such as the function of cardiac valves.

AB Mayas rice is a variety that contributes to staple foods because it has a significant contribution to food consumption and has high genetic diversity. However, the production of Mayas rice plant is lower than other types of rice due to pest attacks and the lack of knowledge of society to identify the types of pests that hit it. Applying the Dempster-Shafer method into an expert system can be a solution for the community to find out the types of the bug found in Mayas rice plants. The data used in this study came from experts with 32 symptoms and 10 types of pests. This study shows the percentage level of possible types of pests found in Mayas rice plant based on the calculation results of the Dempster-Shafer method. The test results on the expert system are 80%, indicating that the expert system is accurate to use in detecting kinds of pests on it.
