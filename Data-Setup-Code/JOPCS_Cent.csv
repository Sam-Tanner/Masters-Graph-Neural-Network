This increases the complexity of developing a generalizable optimal control method that can be transferred to different buildings. Rather than hard-programming human knowledge into the controller (in terms of rules or models), a learning ability can be provided to the controller such that over the time it can learn by itself how to maintain an optimal operation in each specific building. This research proposes a model-free control framework based on Reinforcement Learning that takes into account the stochastic hot water use behavior of occupants, solar power generation, and weather conditions, and learns how to make a balance between the energy use, occupant comfort and water hygiene in a solar-assisted space heating and hot water production system. A stochastic-based offline training procedure is proposed to give a prior experience to the agent in a safe simulation environment, and further ensure occupants comfort and health when the algorithm starts online learning on the real house. To make a realistic assessment without interrupting the occupants, weather conditions and hot water use behavior are experimentally monitored in three case studies in different regions of Switzerland, and the collected data are used in simulations to evaluate the proposed control framework against two rule-based methods. Results indicate that the proposed framework could achieve an energy saving from 7% to 60%, mainly by adapting to solar power generation, without violating comfort or compromising the health of occupants.","[Heidari, Amirreza; Khovalyg, Dolaana] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Lab Integrated Comfort Engn ICE, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Heidari, Amirreza; Marechal, Francois] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Lab Ind Proc & Energy Syst Engn IPESE, CH-1951 Sion, Switzerland; [Heidari, Amirreza] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland","Heidari, A (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland.",amirreza.heidari@epfl.ch; francois.marechal@epfl.ch; dolaana.khovalyg@epfl.ch,"Khovalyg, Dolaana/W-8863-2018","Khovalyg, Dolaana/0000-0001-6064-2513",,,"Ali Adhra, 2017, Data Analytics for Renewable Energy Integration.

State-of-the-art building energy simulations require information on the urban microclimate, but typically rely on ad-hoc numerical simulations, expensive in-situ measurements, or data from nearby weather stations. As such, they do not account for the full range of possible urban microclimate variability and findings cannot be generalized across urban morphologies. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study proposes two data-driven models to downscale climate variables from the meso to the micro scale in arbitrary urban morphologies, with a focus on extreme climate conditions. The models are based on a feedforward and a deep neural network (NN) architecture, and are trained using results from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of flow over a series of idealized but representative urban environments, spanning a realistic range of urban morphologies. Both models feature a relatively good agreement with corresponding CFD training data, with a coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.91 (R-2 = 0.89) and R-2 = 0.94 (R-2 & nbsp;= 0.92) for spatially-distributed wind magnitude and air temperature for the deep NN (feedforward NN). The models generalize well for unseen urban morphologies and mesoscale input data that are within the training bounds in the parameter space, with a R-2 = 0.74 (R2 = 0.69) and R-2 = 0.81 (R-2 = 0.74) for wind magnitude and air temperature for the deep NN (feedforward NN). The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed CFD-NN models makes them well suited for the design of climate-resilient buildings at the early design stage.","[Javanroodi, Kavan; Scartezzini, Jean-Louis] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland;

This work develops thermodynamically-compatible water use effectiveness (WUE) and power usage effectiveness (PUE) ranges needed for direct and indirect water use analysis for 10 different DC archetypes in 15 U.S. climate zones, using a hybrid physical-statistical approach that is validated with real-world data. The ranges further capture variabilities between best and poor DC efficiency practices, showing that PUE and WUE values can have relative difference as much as 62% and 100% respectively, depending on cooling technologies, efficiencies, and locations. PUE results indicate significant climate effects, whereas WUE results indicate the strongest climate effects for airside economizers with either adiabatic or water-cooled chiller systems. Collectively, the results underscore the importance of considering technology, efficiency, and climate effects when estimating PUE and WUE for direct and indirect DC water use analysis. Results also identify variables leading to best-achievable PUE and WUE values by climate zone and cooling system type-including operational set points, use of free cooling, and cooling tower equipment and operational factors-which can support DC water- and energy-efficiency policy initiatives.","[Lei, Nuoa;

J,"Natarajan, A1",,,,"Natarajan, Anand",,,Damage equivalent load synthesis and stochastic extrapolation for fatigue life valiadation,WIND ENERGY SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Present verification of the fatigue life margins on wind turbine structures utilizes damage equivalent load (DEL) computations over a limited time duration. In this article, a procedure to determine long-term fatigue damage and remaining life is presented as a combination of stochastic extrapolation of the 10 min DEL to determine its probability of exceedance and computationally fast synthesis of DELs using level crossings of a Gaussian process. Both the synthesis of DELs and long-term stochastic extrapolation are validated using measured loads from a wind farm. The extrapolation for the blade root flap and tower base fore-aft damage equivalent moment is presented using a three-parameter Weibull distribution, whereby the long-term damage equivalent load levels are forecast for both simulated and measured values. The damage equivalent load magnitude at a selected target probability of exceedance provides an indicator of the integrity of the structure for the next year. The extrapolated damage equivalent load over a year is validated using measured multi-year damage equivalent loads from a turbine in the Lillgrund wind farm, which is subject to wakes. The simulation of damage equivalent loads using the method of level crossings of a Gaussian process is shown to be able to reconstruct the damage equivalent load for both blade root and tower base moments. The prediction of the tower base fore-aft DEL is demonstrated to be feasible when using the Vanmarcke correction for very narrow band processes. The combined method of fast damage equivalent load computations and stochastic extrapolation to the next year allows a quick and accurate forecasting of structural integrity of operational wind turbines.","[Natarajan, Anand] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark","Natarajan, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",anand_nk@hotmail.com,"Natarajan, Anand/C-5517-2011","Natarajan, Anand/0000-0001-6850-0798",European Union [727680],"This research has been supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020 Societal Challenges - Secure, Clean and Efficient Energy, TotalControl Project (grant no. 727680).","Cram?r H., 1967, STATIONARY RELATED ; Dimitrov N, 2021, J PHYS CONF SER, V2018, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/01201; Dimitrov N, 2017, RENEW ENERG, V101, P1180, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2016.10.00; Galinos C, 2016, J PHYS CONF SER, V753, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/753/3/03201; Hoole J, 2019, INT J FATIGUE, V129, DOI 10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2019.10521; Hubler C, 2018, WIND ENERGY, V21, P1092, DOI 10.1002/we.221; Hubler C, 2018, J PHYS CONF SER, V1037, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1037/3/03203; IEC, 2019, IEC61400; Karlina-Barber S, 2016, J PHYS CONF SER, V753, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/753/7/07202; Larsen TJ., 2012, R1597 TU DEN; Madsen HOKS., 1986, METHODS STRUCTURAL ; Meirovitch L., 2003, FUNDAMENTALS VIBRAT; MINER MA, 1945, J APPL MECH-T ASME, V12, pA15; Moriarty P.J., 2004, NRELTP50034421, DOI [10.2172/15011693, DOI 10.2172/15011693; Munters W, 2018, ENERGIES, V11, DOI 10.3390/en1101017; Natarajan A, 2012, WIND ENERGY, V15, P679, DOI 10.1002/we.49; Ragan P, 2007, WIND ENG, V31, P83, DOI 10.1260/03095240778149449; VANMARCKE EH, 1975, J APPL MECH-T ASME, V42, P215, DOI 10.1115/1.342352",18,0,0,0,0,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2366-7443,2366-7451,,WIND ENERGY SCI,Wind Energy Sci.,JUN 2,2022.0,7.0,3,,,,,1171,1181,,10.5194/wes-7-1171-2022,,11,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology,Science & Technology - Other Topics,1T3NH,WOS:000804639300001,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-07-14,0.00368701351904957,1.9319668490372354e-06,0.014047227664087608,0.12141258393434469,0.01345131660326316

For the abovementioned systems, predictions of the one-dimensional Wong formula remain substantially smaller than the sub-barrier fusion data. To address the fusion data, coupled channel calculations have been performed by using the code CCFULL. In the coupled channel calculations, the main effects of intrinsic degrees of freedom associated with the structure of the fusing pairs have been considered. For the O-16 + Sn-112,Sn-116,Sn-120 systems, the fusion enhancement can be traced back to couplings to inelastic excitations of 2+ and 3-vibrational states. However, for the O-18 + Sn-116 reaction, the sub-barrier fusion enhancements cannot be explained by couplings to vibrational degrees of freedom alone. In this case, couplings to two neutron (2n) transfer channels with positive Q-value are needed to reproduce the observed fusion enhancement. On the other hand, the SAGBD calculations remove the discrepancies between the cross section of the onedimensional Wong formula and the experimental results reasonably. Thus, the SAGBD-based results remarkably explain the fusion data of the studied reactions. In the SAGBD model, the large and non-zero values of lambda and V-CBRED for the chosen systems indicate that the nuclear structure of the fusing partners plays a very crucial role in the fusion dynamics of O-16 + Sn-112,Sn-116,Sn-120 reactions while positive Q-value neutron transfer channels and inelastic surface excitations of the collision partners collectively produce a more pronounced effect on the fusion of O-18 + Sn-116 reaction at sub-barrier energies.","[Ghanghas, Vijay;

The most notable and urgent requirement to combat the epidemic was to transform the way human interacts with each other. The adherence to maintaining social distance has given an upsurge to the increased usage of mobile app users. This change in human interaction for fulling their basic to social to work needs through the intervention of app usage has led to privacy concerns by users. By keeping in view the changing dynamics of the way society works, this study is an endeavor to investigate gender differences of ad intrusive and privacy concerns on app usage behavior. Employing a quantitative research design, 371 respondents were surveyed using through an online structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed by using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results suggest that advertising intrusiveness and privacy concerns are significant in determining the consumer's attitude toward App usage, and a positive attitude toward App usage results in App usage behavior. However, gender's moderating role in attitude toward app usage and app usage behavior is insignificant for this study. The study provides a more comprehensive understanding and complements prior insights on ads intrusiveness and privacy concerns toward app usage.","[Bano, Sobia; Sarfraz, Usama] GIFT Univ, GIFT Business Sch, Dept Management Sci, Gujranwala, Pakistan; [Salameh, Anas A.] Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Management Informat Syst, Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia; [Jan, Amin] Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Fac Hospitality Tourism & Wellness, Kota Baharu, Malaysia","Bano, S (corresponding author), GIFT Univ, GIFT Business Sch, Dept Management Sci, Gujranwala, Pakistan.;Jan, AM (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Kelantan, Fac Hospitality Tourism & Wellness, Kota Baharu, Malaysia.",sobia.bano@gift.edu.pk; aminjan@umk.edu.my,,,,,"AJZEN I, 1991, ORGAN BEHAV HUM DEC, V50, P179, DOI 10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-; Anic ID, 2019, ELECTRON COMMER R A, V36, DOI 10.1016/j.elerap.2019.10086; Baek TH, 2012, J ADVERTISING, V41, P59, DOI 10.2753/JOA0091-336741010; Bandara R, 2021, EUR J MARKETING, V55, P219, DOI 10.1108/EJM-06-2019-051; Belanche D, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V12, DOI 10.3390/su1210427; Brehm JW., 1966, THEORY PSYCHOL REAC; Ceci L., NUMBER APPS AVAILAB; Chandiramani K., 2018, J HUM SOC SCI, V23, P4, DOI [10.9790/0837-2303047079, DOI 10.9790/0837-2303047079; Chin W.W., 2010, HDB PARTIAL LEAST SQ, P655, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-32827-8_2; Cho H, 2020, TECHNOL SOC, V63, DOI 10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.10142; Choi H, 2018, COMPUT HUM BEHAV, V81, P42, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2017.12.00; Crossler RE, 2019, INFORM SYST RES, V30, P995, DOI 10.1287/isre.2019.084; Dastane O, 2020, INT J EMERG TRENDS E, V8, P1, DOI [10.30534/ijeter/2020/538102020, DOI 10.30534/IJETER/2020/538102020; DAVIS FD, 1989, MIS QUART, V13, P319, DOI 10.2307/24900; Dogruel L, 2017, COMPUT HUM BEHAV, V77, P230, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2017.08.03; Fazio R.

Offshore wind farm wakes can last several tens of kilometres downstream and thus affect the wind resources of a large area. So far, scale-specific models have been developed but it remains unclear how well the different model types can represent intra-farm wakes, farm-to-farm wakes as well as the wake recovery behind a farm. Thus, in the present analysis the simulation of a set of wind farm models of different complexity, fidelity, scale and computational costs are compared among each other and with SCADA data. In particular, two mesoscale wind farm parameterizations implemented in the mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF), the Explicit Wake Parameterization (EWP) and the Wind Farm Parameterization (FIT), two different high-resolution RANS simulations using PyWakeEllipSys equipped with an actuator disk model, and three rapid engineering wake models from the PyWake suite are selected. The models are applied to the Nysted and Rodsand II wind farms, which are located in the Fehmarn Belt in the Baltic Sea. Based on the performed simulations, we can conclude that both WRF + FIT (BIAS = 0.52 m s(-1)) and WRF + EWP (BIAS = 0.73 m s(-1)) compare well with wind farm affected mast measurements. Compared with the RANS simulations, baseline intra-farm variability, i.e. the wind speed deficit in between turbines, can be captured reasonably well with WRF + FIT using a resolution of 2 km, a typical resolution of mesoscale models for wind energy applications, while WRF + EWP underestimates wind speed deficits. However, both parameterizations can be used to estimate median wind resource reduction caused by an upstream farm. All considered engineering wake models from the PyWake suite simulate peak intra-farm wakes comparable to the high fidelity RANS simulations. However, they considerably underestimate the farm wake effect of an upstream farm although with different magnitudes. Overall, the higher computational costs of PyWakeEllipSys and WRF compared with those of PyWake pay off in terms of accuracy for situations when farm-to-farm wakes are important.","[Fischereit, Jana; Hansen, Kurt Schaldemose; Larsen, Xiaoli Guo; van der Laan, Maarten Paul; Rethore, Pierre-Elouan; Leon, Juan Pablo Murcia] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind & Energy Syst, Roskilde, Denmark","Fischereit, J (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind & Energy Syst, Roskilde, Denmark.",janf@dtu.dk,"; van der Laan, M.

Starting from a related paper, the authors illustrated how to include human perception and psychoacoustics in evaluating an acoustic metawindow (AMW) unit effectiveness. This paper investigates the robustness of the mixed laboratory and online methodology and proves the validity of the exclusively online-based soundscape questionnaire method according to a number of headset setups. For this reason, a first Laboratory experiment with a fixed and controlled setup was followed by an Online 1 experiment, where the same participants took the same questionnaire (with a three weeks' time difference). Finally, the Online 2 experiment was used to broaden the sample background (results concerned the online method only). The setups mostly influenced the participants' responses by neutralising it (in 48% of the cases) while reporting a rate with an acceptable error (45% of Arate = 0/5 and 39% of Arate = 1/5). Wired headphones based rates agreed with the laboratory one consistently (36% of Arate = 0 and overall CV = 2-25% through soundscape descriptors). Wired earphones had a similar Arate percentage but with an overall more neutralised soundscape perception (overall CV = 1-40% compared with Laboratory rates). Wireless earphones caused the extremer Arate (54% of Arate = 3). Finally, natural and human noises are more detectable spontaneously, while traffic or other artificial noise are mostly recognised when directly addressed to the participants. This additional analysis gives more precise information about how efficient is the online method compared to the laboratory one. If accounted accordingly, an online-based soundscape questionnaire setup could also be viewed as a solid alternative to grasp a wider range of human perception points of view according to a broader cultural and geographical background.

For this, an ex-post-facto study was conducted which was descriptive, comparative, and cross-sectional in nature. The main analyses carried out are of a descriptive and inferential nature, the latter to analyze the differences and associations between the variables of critical thinking and motivation (ANOVA test and an structural equations models) in both groups. Main outcomes included the lack of significant differences in dispositions towards critical thinking between Spanish and foreign students, alongside the existence of significant differences in academic motivation between both of these groups. In addition to this, significant differences were found within the group of Spanish nationality students in the dimensions of critical thinking as a function of intrinsic motivation, whilst such differences emerged in the foreign nationality group as a function of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and amotivation. Finally, within the group of Spanish students, a significant and positive relationship was found between motivation and critical thinking, being positive and non-significant in the foreign national group. In conclusion, it is necessary to improve dispositions towards critical thinking and educational motivation from the educational system for the inclusion of minors and youths in today's society.","[Parejo-Jimenez, Noelia; Exposito-Lopez, Jorge; Chacon-Cuberos, Ramon; Maria Olmedo-Moreno, Eva] Univ Granada, Fac Educ, Dept Res Methods & Diag Educ, Granada 18071, Spain","Parejo-Jimenez, N (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Fac Educ, Dept Res Methods & Diag Educ, Granada 18071, Spain.",noeliaparejo@ugr.es; jorgeel@ugr.es; rchacon@ugr.es; emolmedo@ugr.es,"Chacon Cuberos, Ramon/H-7507-2017; OLMEDO, EVA/K-6810-2014; Exposito, Jorge/K-7645-2014","Chacon Cuberos, Ramon/0000-0003-0937-1089; OLMEDO, EVA/0000-0003-0558-1513; Exposito, Jorge/0000-0001-9076-0377; PAREJO JIMENEZ, NOELIA/0000-0003-0400-2559","RDI project [B-SEJ-192-UGR18, PID2020-119194RB-I00]; FEDER-European Union; MCIN/AEI",This research was funded by RDI project: B-SEJ-192-UGR18.

A reinforcement learning agent takes actions, which can be direct HVAC actuator commands or setpoints for control loops in building automation systems. The actions are taken to optimize one or more targets, such as indoor air quality, energy consumption and energy cost. The agent receives feedback from the HVAC systems to quantify how well these targets have been achieved. The feedback is captured by a reward function designed by the developer of the reinforcement learning agent. A few reviews have focused on the reward aspect of reinforcement learning applications for HVAC. However, there is a lack of reviews that assess how the actions of the reinforcement learning agent have been formulated, and how this impacts the possibilities to achieve various optimization targets in single zone or multi-zone buildings. The aim of this review is to identify the action formulations in the literature and to assess how the choice of formulation impacts the level of abstraction at which the HVAC systems are considered. Our methodology involves a search string in the Web of Science database and a list of selection criteria applied to each article in the search results. For each selected article, a three-tier categorization of the selected articles has been performed. Firstly, the applicability of the approach to buildings with one or more zones is considered. Secondly, the articles are categorized by the type of action taken by the agent, such as a binary, discrete or continuous action. Thirdly, the articles are categorized by the aspects of the indoor environment being controlled, namely temperature, humidity or air quality. The main result of the review is this three-tier categorization that reveals the community's emphasis on specific HVAC applications, as well as the readiness to interface the reinforcement learning solutions to HVAC systems. The article concludes with a discussion of trends in the field as well as challenges that require further research.","[Sierla, Seppo; Ihasalo, Heikki; Vyatkin, Valeriy] Aalto Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Dept Elect Engn & Automat, FI-00076 Espoo, Finland;

Design/methodology/approach Student focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with six students from each of the classes involved in the research lessons. Students were asked specific questions relating to the research lessons and teachers. Findings Findings suggest that there are some changes in students' perception of classroom climate and their motivation to learn after the implementation of lesson study for learning community. Together with self-determination theory, lesson study for learning community may be viewed as a social and collaborative model as well as a supportive learning climate, promoting students' adaptive outcomes and needs satisfaction. Research limitations/implications Teachers need to be provided support to plan their lessons and to become familiar with the lesson study for learning community approach. There is also a major challenge of teacher buy-in whether they would undertake the practice of lesson study for learning community voluntarily. Originality/value This study provides evidence of the existence of an approach via listening pedagogy for the teaching of listening that focuses on students' motivation to listen and learn in class.","[Ng, Betsy; Latife, Aneesah] Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore, Singapore","Latife, A (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore, Singapore.",aneesah.latife@gmail.com,,"Latife, Aneesah/0000-0001-9970-884X","Office of Educational Research (OER); National Institute of Education (NIE), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore [OER 19/17 LKE]","Special thanks to the research team and participants.

J,"Sebastiani, A1;  Pena, A;  Troldborg, N;  Forsting, AM",,,,"Sebastiani, Alessandro; Pena, Alfredo; Troldborg, Niels; Forsting, Alexander Meyer",,,Evaluation of the global-blockage effect on power performance through simulations and measurements,WIND ENERGY SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,WIND; FLOW; MODELS,"Blockage effects due to the interaction of five wind turbines in a row are investigated through both Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations and site measurements. Since power performance tests are often carried out at sites consisting of several turbines in a row, the objective of this study is to evaluate whether the power performance of the five turbines differs from that of an isolated turbine. A number of simulations are performed, in which we vary the turbine inter-spacing (1.8, 2 and 3 rotor diameters) and the inflow angle between the incoming wind and the orthogonal line to the row (from 0 to 45 degrees). Different values of the free-stream velocity are considered to cover a broad wind speed range of the power curve. Numerical results show consistent power deviations for all five turbines when compared to the isolated case. The amplitude of these deviations depends on the location of the turbine within the row, the inflow angle, the inter-spacing and the power curve region of operation. We show that the power variations do not cancel out when averaging over a large inflow sector (from -45 to +45 degrees) and find an increase in the power output of up to +1 % when compared to the isolated case under idealised conditions (neutral atmospheric conditions, no vertical wind shear or ground effects). We simulate power performance measurements with both a virtual mast and nacelle-mounted lidar and find a combination of power output increase and upstream velocity reduction, which causes an increase of +4 % in the power coefficient under idealised conditions. We also use measurements from a real site consisting of a row of five wind turbines to validate the numerical results. From the analysis of the measurements, we also show that the power performance is impacted by the neighbouring turbines. Compared to when the inflow is perpendicular to the row, the power output varies by +1.8 % and -1.8 % when the turbine is the most downwind and upwind of the line, respectively.","[Sebastiani, Alessandro; Pena, Alfredo; Troldborg, Niels; Forsting, Alexander Meyer] DTU Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark","Sebastiani, A (corresponding author), DTU Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",aseb@dtu.dk,"; Meyer Forsting, Alexander Raul/V-6268-2018","Pena Diaz, Alfredo/0000-0002-7900-9651; Sebastiani, Alessandro/0000-0002-4351-9510; Meyer Forsting, Alexander Raul/0000-0002-3133-1860",European Union Horizon 2020 through the Innovation Training Network Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions: Lidar Knowledge Europe (LIKE) [858358],This work has received funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 through the Innovation Training Network Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions: Lidar Knowledge Europe (LIKE (grant no. 858358)).,"Allaerts D, 2017, J FLUID MECH, V814, P95, DOI 10.1017/jfm.2017.1; [Anonymous], 2017, IEC6140012; Barthelmie RJ, 2009, WIND ENERGY, V12, P431, DOI 10.1002/we.34; Bleeg J, 2018, ENERGIES, V11, DOI 10.3390/en1106160; Crespo A., 1999, WIND ENERGY, V2, P1, DOI [10.1002/(SICI)1099-1824(199901/03)2:1%3C1::AID-WE16%3E3.0.CO;2-7, 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1824(199901/03)2:13.0.CO;2-7, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1824(199901/03)2:1<1::AID-WE16>3.0.CO;2-7; Forsting AM, 2021, J PHYS CONF SER, V1934, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1934/1/01202; Forsting ARM, 2018, J PHYS CONF SER, V1037, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1037/7/07203; Forsting ARM, 2017, WIND ENERGY, V20, P1481, DOI 10.1002/we.210; Forsting ARM, 2017, J PHYS CONF SER, V854, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/854/1/01201; Forsting ARM, 2015, J PHYS CONF SER, V625, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/625/1/01202; Forsting ARM, 2017, WIND ENERGY, V20, P63, DOI 10.1002/we.199; Gocmen T, 2016, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V60, P752, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2016.01.11; Jonkman J, 2009, DEFINITION 5MW REFE; McTavish S, 2015, WIND ENERGY, V18, P1989, DOI 10.1002/we.180; Medici D, 2011, WIND ENERGY, V14, P691, DOI 10.1002/we.45; MENTER FR, 1994, AIAA J, V32, P1598, DOI 10.2514/3.1214; Meyer Forsting A., 2017, THESIS DTU WIND ENER, DOI [10.11581/DTU:00000022, DOI 10.11581/DTU:00000022; Michelsen J.A., 1992, 9205 AFM TU DENM DE; Michelsen J.A, 1994, 9406 AFM TU DEN; Nishino T, 2015, J PHYS CONF SER, V625, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/625/1/01201; Porte-Agel F, 2020, BOUND-LAY METEOROL, V174, P1, DOI 10.1007/s10546-019-00473-; Rethore PE, 2012, WIND ENERGY, V15, P915, DOI 10.1002/we.52; Schneemann J, 2021, WIND ENERGY SCI, V6, P521, DOI 10.5194/wes-6-521-202; Sebastiani A., 2022, DATA SIMULATIONS 5 W, DOI [10.11583/DTU.17263163, DOI 10.11583/DTU.17263163; Sebastiani A, 2021, WIND ENERGY, V24, P634, DOI 10.1002/we.259; Segalini A, 2020, WIND ENERGY, V23, P120, DOI 10.1002/we.241; Smith RB, 2010, WIND ENERGY, V13, P449, DOI 10.1002/we.36; Sorensen N.N, 1995, THESIS RISO NATL LA; Strickland JMI, 2020, J PHYS CONF SER, V1618, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1618/6/06206; Troldborg N, 2015, COMPUT FLUIDS, V119, P197, DOI 10.1016/j.compfluid.2015.06.02; van der Laan MP, 2015, WIND ENERGY, V18, P2223, DOI 10.1002/we.181; van der Laan MP, 2019, WIND ENERGY SCI, V4, P251, DOI 10.5194/wes-4-251-201; Wagner R, 2011, WIND ENERGY, V14, P993, DOI 10.1002/we.50",33,0,0,0,0,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2366-7443,2366-7451,,WIND ENERGY SCI,Wind Energy Sci.,APR 14,2022.0,7.0,2,,,,,875,886,,10.5194/wes-7-875-2022,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology,Science & Technology - Other Topics,0M8NX,WOS:000782406300001,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2022-07-14,0.006759524784924212,0.00507057453462865,0.016110899111387817,0.12187936888356302,0.01608312863830803

A simple k-E RANS turbulence model for simulation of wind turbine wakes in the unstable surface layer is presented, which is based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST). The turbulence model parametrizes buoyant production of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) without the use of an active temperature equation, and flow balance is ensured throughout the domain by modifications of the turbulence transport equations. Large eddy simulations and experimental data from the literature are used for validation of the model.","[Baungaard, Mads; van der Laan, Maarten Paul; Kelly, Mark] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Wind Energy, Riso Campus,Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark","Baungaard, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Wind Energy, Riso Campus,Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",mchba@dtu.dk,"van der Laan, M.

However, obtaining a comprehensive perspective on wind energy considering the many diverse factors that impact its development and growth is challenging. A significant factor in the evolution of wind energy is technological advancement and most previous reviews have focused on this topic. However, wind energy is influenced by a host of other factors, such as financial viability, environmental concerns, government incentives, and the impact of wind on the ecosystem. This review aims to fill a gap, providing a comprehensive review on the diverse factors impacting wind energy development and providing readers with a holistic panoramic, furnishing a clearer perspective on its future growth. Data for wind energy was evaluated by applying pivot data analytics and geographic information systems. The factors impacting wind energy growth and development are reviewed, providing an overview of how these factors have impacted wind maturity. The future of wind energy development is assessed considering its social acceptance, financial viability, government incentives, and the minimization of the unintended potential negative impacts of this technology. The review is able to conclude that wind energy may continue growing all over the world as long as all the factors critical to its development are addressed. Wind power growth will be supported by stakeholders' holistic considerations of all factors impacting this industry, as evaluated in this review.","[Haces-Fernandez, Francisco; Li, Hua] Texas A&M Univ, Coll Business Adm, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA;

In the context of societal actors' ability to reuse such data, one of the most important features of ODG is its quality. Thus, through this research, we aim to address the level of data quality by introducing a new framework that constantly monitors and evaluates the OGD quality of Western Balkan (WB) National Open Data Portals. The advantage of the proposed framework is the integration on the portal level enabling information exposure about the quality dimension at any time. An additional value of the framework is the ability to provide recommendations with the intention of improving quality issues. The applicability and findings of the proposed framework are not limited to the WB and once contextualized that could be applied to other countries in the Eastern European that face similar data quality challenges.","[Raca, Vigan; Velinov, Goran; Dzalev, Stefan; Kon-Popovska, Margita] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Skopje, North Macedonia","Raca, V (corresponding author), Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Comp Sci & Engn, Str Ruder Boshkovikj,16 PO 393i, Skopje 1000, North Macedonia.",viganraca@gmail.com,,,,,"5-star Open Data, 2012, 5 STAR DAT RETR FEB; Allison B, 2010, OPEN GOVT COLLABORAT, P25; Batini C, 2009, ACM COMPUT SURV, V41, DOI 10.1145/1541880.154188; Berners-Lee T, 2006, INT J SEMANT WEB INF, V4, P1, DOI DOI 10.4018/JSWIS.200908190; Bishop L, 2017, SAGE OPEN, V7, DOI 10.1177/215824401668513; Charalabidis Y, 2018, PUB ADMIN INF TECH, V28, P1, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-90850-2_; Clark K.R, 2018, RADIOL TECHNOL, V8; Custers B, 2018, COMPUT LAW SECUR REV, V34, P234, DOI 10.1016/j.clsr.2017.09.00; D'Amore JD, 2021, J AM MED INFORM ASSN, V28, P1534, DOI 10.1093/jamia/ocab03; Davies T, 2016, J COMMUNITY INFORM, V1; Donker FW, 2017, INT J DIGIT EARTH, V10, P284, DOI 10.1080/17538947.2016.122493; Faniel IM, 2016, J ASSOC INF SCI TECH, V67, P1404, DOI 10.1002/asi.2348; Galetta D.-U, 2018, RIGHT ACCESS PUBLIC, P34; Gasco-Hernandez M, 2018, GOV INFORM Q, V35, P233, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2018.01.00; Hazen BT, 2017, INT J PROD ECON, V193, P737, DOI 10.1016/j.ijpe.2017.08.02; Kawashita I, 2020, CEUR WORKSHOP ; Lindgren I, 2019, ELECT GOV; Naumann F, 2000, P 5 INT C INF QUAL H, P14; Neves FT, 2020, CITIES, V106, DOI 10.1016/j.cities.2020.10286; Nikiforova A, 2021, GOV INFORM Q, V38, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2021.10162; Nogueira PJ, 2020, J CLIN MED, V9, DOI 10.3390/jcm908236; OKFn, 2018, OP DEF OP DAT QUAL ; Pignotti E, 2011, P DIG ENG 2011 NEW; Purwanto Arie, 2020, dg.o '20: The 21st Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research, P310, DOI 10.1145/3396956.339695; Raca V, 2021, INT J ADV COMPUT SC, V12, P2; Safarov I, 2017, INFORM POLITY, V22, P1, DOI 10.3233/IP-16001; Saxena S, 2017, FORESIGHT, V19, P421, DOI 10.1108/FS-02-2017-000; Slibar B, 2021, SAGE OPEN, V11, DOI 10.1177/2158244021102317; Tauberer J, 2014, OPEN GOVT DATA BOOK, V2nd ed., P6; Torchiano M, 2017, P INT COMP SOFTW APP, P144, DOI 10.1109/COMPSAC.2017.19; Ubaldi B, 2013, OPEN GOVT DATA EMPI; Veljkovic N, 2014, GOV INFORM Q, V31, P278, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2013.10.01; Vetro A, 2016, GOV INFORM Q, V33, P325, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2016.02.00; Viscusi Gianluigi, 2014, Information Polity, V19, P263, DOI 10.3233/IP-14033; Walch A, 2021, J PHYS CONF SER, V2042, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/01201; World Wide Web Foundation and The GovernanceLab at NYU, 2016, COMM METH ASS OP DA; Wormell I, 1990, P NORDINFO SEM ROYA; Zaveri A, 2012, SEMANTIC WEB J, V1, P; Zaveri A, 2016, SEMANT WEB, V7, P63, DOI 10.3233/SW-15017; Zhu XH, 2019, J ASSOC INF SCI TECH, V70, P27, DOI 10.1002/asi.2408; Zuiderwijk A, 2021, TELEMAT INFORM, V62, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2021.10163; Zuiderwijk A, 2014, GOV INFORM Q, V31, P17, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2013.04.00",42,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2158-2440,,,SAGE OPEN,SAGE Open,APR,2022.0,12.0,2,,,,,,,21582440221104812,10.1177/21582440221104813,,19,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Sciences - Other Topics,2F7MV,WOS:000813091100001,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.008603031544448997,5.89054897876026e-10,0.01632130238387259,0.08537950332284015,0.01632130238387259
J,"Zheng, S1;  Meng, Q;  Wang, XY",,,,"Zheng, Sun; Meng, Qi; Wang, Xin-Yu",,,Quantitative endoscopic photoacoustic tomography using a convolutional neural network,APPLIED OPTICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; ONE-STEP,"Endoscopic photoacoustic tomography (EPAT) is a catheter-based hybrid imaging modality capable of providing structural and functional information of biological luminal structures, such as coronary arterial vessels and the digestive tract. The recovery of the optical properties of the imaged tissue from acoustic measurements achieved by optical inversion is essential for implementing quantitative EPAT (qEPAT). In this paper, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on deep gradient descent is developed for qEPAT. The network enables the reconstruction of images representing the spatially varying absorption coefficient in cross-sections of the tubular structures from limited measurement data. The forward operator reflecting the mapping from the absorption coefficient to the optical deposition due to pulsed irradiation is embedded into the network training. The network parameters are optimized layer by layer through the deep gradient descent mechanism using the numerically simulated data. The operation processes of the forward operator and its adjoint operator are separated from the network training. The trained network outputs an image representing the distribution of absorption coefficients by inputting an image that represents the optical deposition. The method has been tested with computer-generated phantoms mimicking coronary arterial vessels containing various tissue types. Results suggest that the structural similarity of the images reconstructed by our method is increased by about 10% in comparison with the non-learning method based on error minimization in the case of the same measuring view.

The application of various sources, which differ in the way in which they drive the interface into motion, and two surfactants with different rheological properties made it possible to generalize the results and to develop a unified approach to describing the problem. We show that the threshold occurrence of a two-zone flow structure with an axisymmetric flow nearby the source and stagnant zone at the periphery results from the competition between two counter-directed shear stresses caused by surfactant concentration inhomogeneity and source influence. We demonstrate that, regardless of the source type, the ratio of these stresses, known as the elasticity number, can be used to predict the formation of a two-zone flow and to define the position of the boundary between the zones. We examined in detail the conditions for formation of the multi-vortex flow within the stagnant zone. Although this phenomenon has been observed by many researchers, it has not yet met a consistent physical explanation. We hypothesized that the formation of vortices can be considered as the instability of the mechanical equilibrium of the surfactant layer caused by the shear on the side of the underlying bulk flow. Based on the mechanism suggested, we introduced a non-dimensional parameter, called the surface Rayleigh number, and estimated its critical value. Finally we analysed the conditions for the occurrence of this instability, called the shear-driven surfactant layer instability in some famous problems of interfacial hydrodynamics.","[Mizev, Aleksey; Shmyrov, Andrey; Shmyrova, Anastasia] RAS, Inst Continuous Media Mech, Ural Branch, Acad Koroleva St 1, Perm 614000, Russia","Mizev, A (corresponding author), RAS, Inst Continuous Media Mech, Ural Branch, Acad Koroleva St 1, Perm 614000, Russia.",alex_mizev@icmm.ru,"Shmyrova, Anastasia/Q-6600-2017; Mizev, Aleksey/U-6792-2018","Shmyrova, Anastasia/0000-0001-9199-2487; Mizev, Aleksey/0000-0001-5233-8271",Russian Science Foundation [19-71-00097]; Ministry of Science and High Education of Russia [121031700169-1],A.

However professional photography content is also needed for taking high-quality photos by mobile phones as ones taken by professional cameras. Existing learning tools for photography can't provide photographic practice while presenting theoretical content, nor give real-time photography guidance according to the environment. Mobile augmented reality (AR) technology provides a new way to solve these problems by creating a real learning situation. Therefore, an innovative AR-based mobile photography application (ARMPA) is designed and developed as a method to connect theory and practice. Based on Learning-by-Doing instructional strategy, the ARMPA can timely and synchronously display the theoretical content of photography in the form of text and images corresponding to learners' practical operation. Moreover, it can provide learners real-time interaction and guidance by using AR environment sensing technology. The effect of ARMPA on learning gain and cognitive load is assessed by traditional methods of pre/post-test and questionnaires. To objectively explore the effectiveness of ARMPA from a cognitive and emotional perspective, we measure and extract four emotional state indexes of electroencephalogram (EEG) including engagement (ENG), relaxation (MED), interest (INT) and focus (FOC). Compared to traditional two-dimension (2 D) application (APP), ARMPA improves learners' learning gains, decreases learners' cognitive loads. The participants in the AR group achieve better emotional states than those in the 2 D group. This study provides some empirical evidence for AR technology to boost mobile phone photography.","[Zhao, Gang; Zhang, Lina; Chu, Jie; Hu, Biling; He, Hui] Cent China Normal Univ, Fac Artificial Intelligence Educ, 152 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lina] Da Li Univ, Sch Math & Comp, 2 Hongsheng Rd, Dali 671003, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Wenjuan] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Jing Hengyi Sch Educ, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Yang, Li] Hubei Univ Educ, Comp Sch, Wuhan, Peoples R China","Zhang, LN (corresponding author), Cent China Normal Univ, Fac Artificial Intelligence Educ, 152 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Zhang, LN (corresponding author), Da Li Univ, Sch Math & Comp, 2 Hongsheng Rd, Dali 671003, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",jxry@mails.ccnu.edu.cn,,,Humanities and Social Science project of Chinese Ministry of Education [17YJA880104]; Research on Automatic Segmentation and Recognition of Teaching Scene with the Characteristics of Teaching Behavior of National Natural Science Foundation of China [61977034]; Research on Key Technology of Intelligent Education Evaluation and Service Based on Blockchain Technology - CCNU [CCNU20ZN004],This work is supported by the Project named Research on Outdoor Experiential Learning Environment Construction Method Based on Scene Perception granted by the Humanities and Social Science project of Chinese Ministry of Education [17YJA880104]; and the Research on Automatic Segmentation and Recognition of Teaching Scene with the Characteristics of Teaching Behavior of National Natural Science Foundation of China [61977034]; and the Research on Key Technology of Intelligent Education Evaluation and Service Based on Blockchain Technology (CCNU20ZN004) financially supported by self-determined research funds of CCNU from the colleges' basic research and operation of MOE.,"Akcayir M, 2017, EDUC RES REV-NETH, V20, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.edurev.2016.11.00; Akcayir M, 2016, COMPUT HUM BEHAV, V57, P334, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.12.05; Ally Mohamed., 2014, RUSC-UNIV KNOWL SOC, V11, P142, DOI [10.7238/rusc.v11i1.2033, DOI 10.7238/rusc.v11i1.2033; Azuma RT, 1997, PRESENCE-VIRTUAL AUG, V6, P355, DOI 10.1162/pres.1997.6.4.35; Bauerfeind K, 2021, APPL ERGON, V94, DOI 10.1016/j.apergo.2021.10339; Bransford J., 2000, PEOPLE LEARN BRAIN M, DOI DOI 10.17226/985; Bugg E.G., 1934, AM J PSYCHOL, V46, P52; Cabero-Almenara J, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/su1118499; Cai S, 2017, INTERACT LEARN ENVIR, V25, P778, DOI 10.1080/10494820.2016.118109; Chen CH, 2016, ASIA-PAC EDUC RES, V25, P567, DOI 10.1007/s40299-016-0284-; Cheng KH, 2017, AUSTRALAS J EDUC TEC, V33, P53, DOI 10.14742/ajet.282; Chung N, 2015, COMPUT HUM BEHAV, V50, P588, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.02.06; Crk I, 2016, ACM T COMPUT-HUM INT, V23, DOI 10.1145/282994; Cuibo Yu., 2017, J DISTANCE ED, V35, P104, DOI [10.15881/j.cnki.cn33-1304/g4.2017.04.011, DOI 10.15881/J.CNKI.CN33-1304/G4.2017.04.011; DeBerry-Spence B, 2019, J PUBLIC POLICY MARK, V38, P81, DOI 10.1177/074391561882058; Delahunty T, 2018, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V27, P114, DOI 10.1007/s10956-017-9712-; Di Serio A, 2013, COMPUT EDUC, V68, P586, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2012.03.00; Eseryel D, 2014, EDUC TECHNOL SOC, V17, P4; ESTRADA CA, 1994, MOTIV EMOTION, V18, P285, DOI 10.1007/BF0285647; Garzon J, 2019, VIRTUAL REAL-LONDON, V23, P447, DOI 10.1007/s10055-019-00379-; Heraz A, 2007, 7TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES, PROCEEDINGS, P853, DOI 10.1109/ICALT.2007.27; Hsu TC, 2017, COMPUT EDUC, V106, P137, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2016.12.00; Huang XY, 2021, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V13, DOI 10.3390/su1309463; Huang YM, 2020, IEEE ACCESS, V8, P38880, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.297505; Jang J, 2021, IEEE ACCESS, V9, P6798, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.304870; Jiang SL, 2021, FRONT PSYCHOL, V12, DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2021.60787; Ko SM, 2013, INT J HUM-COMPUT INT, V29, P501, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2012.72246; Kucuk S, 2016, ANAT SCI EDUC, V9, P411, DOI 10.1002/ase.160; Kuder GF, 1937, PSYCHOMETRIKA, V2, P151, DOI 10.1007/BF0228839; Li Mu, 2009, Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc, V2009, P1323, DOI 10.1109/IEMBS.2009.533413; Liou HH, 2017, EDUC TECHNOL SOC, V20, P11; Liu QT, 2021, J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR, V37, P645, DOI 10.1111/jcal.1251; Mailhot T, 2018, NURS RES, V67, P43, DOI 10.1097/NNR.000000000000026; Majeed Z.H., 2020, INT J ADV TECHNOL EN, V7, P20, DOI [10.19101/IJATEE.2019.650068, DOI 10.19101/IJATEE.2019.650068; Mampusti E.

When many users are connected to the grid, high-performance forecasting models are required, posing several problems associated with the availability of historical energy consumption data for each end-user and training, deploying and maintaining a model for each user. Moreover, introducing new end-users to an existing network poses problems relating to their forecasting model. Global models, trained on all available data, are emerging as the best solution in several contexts, because they show higher generalization performance, being able to leverage the patterns that are similar across different time series. In this work, the lodging/residential electricity 1-h-ahead load forecasting of multiple time series for smart grid applications is addressed using global models, suggesting the effectiveness of such an approach also in the energy context. Results obtained on a subset of the Great Energy Predictor III dataset with several global models are compared to results obtained with local models based on the same methods, showing that global models can perform similarly to the local ones, while presenting simpler deployment and maintainability. In this work, the forecasting of a new time series, representing a new end-user introduced in the pre-existing network, is also approached under specific assumptions, by using a global model trained using data related to the existing end-users. Results reveal that the forecasting model pre-trained on data related to other end-users allows the attainment of good forecasting performance also for new end-users.","[Buonanno, Amedeo; Caliano, Martina; Pontecorvo, Antonino; Valenti, Maria] ENEA, Dept Energy Technol & Renewable Energy Sources, I-80055 Portici, Italy; [Sforza, Gianluca; Graditi, Giorgio] ENEA, Dept Energy Technol & Renewable Energy Sources, I-00123 Rome, Italy","Buonanno, A (corresponding author), ENEA, Dept Energy Technol & Renewable Energy Sources, I-80055 Portici, Italy.",amedeo.buonanno@enea.it; martina.caliano@enea.it; antonino.pontecorvo@enea.it; gianluca.sforza@enea.it; maria.valenti@enea.it; giorgio.graditi@enea.it,,"Buonanno, Amedeo/0000-0003-3494-2648",European Union; Italian Research and University Ministry (MIUR) under the Programma Operativo Nazionale Ricerca e Innovazione 2014-2020 (PON RI 2014-2020) [ARS01_01259],The project has been jointly funded by the European Union and Italian Research and University Ministry (MIUR) under the Programma Operativo Nazionale Ricerca e Innovazione 2014-2020 (PON R&I 2014-2020) Grant Number ARS01_01259.,"Abbasi R.A., 2019, ADV INTELLIGENT SYST, V92; Ahn Y, 2022, ENERG BUILDINGS, V258, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.11171; Bai S., 2018, ARXIV 18030127; Bandara K., 2019, NEURAL INFORM PROCES, V1195; Burgio A, 2020, ENERGIES, V13, DOI 10.3390/en1302035; Caliano M., 2020, P 12 AEIT INT ANN ; Cao ZN, 2021, J CLEAN PROD, V326, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.12924; Daut MAM, 2017, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V70, P1108, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2016.12.01; Fan C, 2020, APPL ENERG, V262, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.11449; Genov E, 2021, J PHYS CONF SER, V2042, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/01203; Herzen J., 2021, UNIT8 070; Herzen J., 2021, ARXIV21100322; Hewamalage H, 2022, PATTERN RECOGN, V124, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2021.10844; IEA, 2021, EL MARK RE; Januschowski T, 2020, INT J FORECASTING, V36, P167, DOI 10.1016/j.ijforecast.2019.05.00; Ke GL, 2017, ADV NEUR IN, V3; Kong WC, 2018, IEEE T POWER SYST, V33, P1087, DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2017.268817; Laptev N., 2017, P INT C MACH LEARN ; Liang Y, 2019, ENERGY, V166, P653, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2018.10.11; Makridakis S., 2022, INT J FORECAST, DOI [10.1016/j.ijforecast.2021.11.013, DOI 10.1016/J.IJFORECAST.2021.11.013; Makridakis S, 2020, INT J FORECASTING, V36, P54, DOI 10.1016/j.ijforecast.2019.04.01; Manda P, 2006, INT J ELEC POWER, V28, P367, DOI 10.1016/j.ijepes.2005.12.00; Miller C, 2020, SCI TECHNOL BUILT EN, V26, P1427, DOI 10.1080/23744731.2020.179551; Mocanu E, 2016, ENERG BUILDINGS, V116, P646, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.01.03; Montero-Manso P, 2021, INT J FORECASTING, V37, P1632, DOI 10.1016/j.ijforecast.2021.03.00; Oreshkin B.N., 2020, ARXIV19051043; Pan SJ, 2010, IEEE T KNOWL DATA EN, V22, P1345, DOI 10.1109/TKDE.2009.19; Rafati A, 2020, ENERGY, V201, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2020.11751; Ribeiro M, 2018, ENERG BUILDINGS, V165, P352, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.01.03; Sen R., 2019, P 33 C NEUR INF PRO; Shi H, 2018, IEEE T SMART GRID, V9, P5271, DOI 10.1109/TSG.2017.268601; Vaswani A., 2017, P INT C NEUR INF PRO, P599; Wagner N, 2011, INT J INTELL COMPUT, V4, P284, DOI 10.1108/1756378111115999; Wu D, 2020, IEEE T SMART GRID, V11, P1183, DOI 10.1109/TSG.2019.293341; Zhang F, 2016, ENERG BUILDINGS, V126, P94, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.05.02; Zhang N, 2019, ENERGY, V189, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2019.11635; Zhang X.M., 2018, P 2018 17 IEEE INT ; Zheng J, 2017, 2017 51ST ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SCIENCES AND SYSTEMS (CISS",39,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,MAR,2022.0,15.0,6,,,,,,,2037,10.3390/en15062037,,18,Energy & Fuels,Energy & Fuels,0E8LE,WOS:000776925300001,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.0077836952068824255,2.7787984225709497e-08,0.014695219388173473,0.09845520913160972,0.014695219388173473

The common approach for energy demand estimation is using only typical meso-scale weather data in building energy models (BEMs), which underestimates the impacts of extreme climate and microclimate variations. To quantify the impacts of such underestimation on assessing the future energy performance of buildings, this study simulates a high spatiotemporal resolution BEM for two representative residential buildings located in a 600 x 600 m2 urban area in Southeast Sweden while accounting for both climate change and microclimate. Future climate data are synthesized using 13 future climate scenarios over 2010-2099, divided into three 30-year periods, and microclimate data are generated considering the urban morphology of the area. It is revealed that microclimate can cause 17% rise in cooling degree-day (CDD) and 7% reduction in heating degree-day (HDD) on average compared to mesoclimate. Considering typical weather conditions, CDD increases by 45% and HDD decreases by 8% from one 30-year period to another. Differences can become much larger during extreme weather conditions. For example, CDD can increase by 500% in an extreme warm July compared to a typical one. Results also indicate that annual cooling demand becomes four and five times bigger than 2010-2039 in 2040-2069 and 2070-2099, respectively. The daily peak cooling load can increase up to 25% in an extreme warm day when accounting for microclimate. In the absence of cooling systems during extreme warm days, the indoor temperature stays above 26 degrees C continuously over a week and reaches above 29.2 degrees C. Moreover, the annual overheating hours can increase up to 140% in the future. These all indicate that not accounting for influencing climate variations can result in maladaptation or insufficient adaptation of urban areas to climate change.","[Hosseini, Mohammad] NTNU Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Engn, Dept Ocean Operat & Civil Engn, Alesund, Norway; [Hosseini, Mohammad; Nik, Vahid M.] Lund Univ, Div Bldg Phys, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, SE-22363 Lund, Sweden; [Javanroodi, Kavan; Nik, Vahid M.] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Div Bldg Technol, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Javanroodi, Kavan] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab LESO PB, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Nik, VM (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Div Bldg Phys, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, SE-22363 Lund, Sweden.;Nik, VM (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Div Bldg Technol, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",mohammad.hosseini@ntnu.no; kavan.javanroodi@epfl.ch; vahid.nik@byggtek.lth.se,,,"joint programming initiative 'ERANet Smart Energy Systems' focus initiative on Integrated, Regional Energy Systems; European Union [775970, 101033683]; Centre for Innovation Research at Lund University (CIRCLE); Sweden's innovation agency (VINNOVA -MIRAI)","This work was supported by the joint programming initiative `ERANet Smart Energy Systems' focus initiative on Integrated, Regional Energy Systems, with support from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [775970] and the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement for the COLLECTiEF (Collective Intelligence for Energy Flexibility) project (grant agreement ID: 101033683).

It measures air temperature, humidity, globe temperature, brightness temperature, light intensity, and wind, and is capable of calculating thermal indices (e.g., physiologically equivalent temperature (PET)) on site. It visualizes its data on an integrated display and sends them continuously to a server, where web-based visualizations are available in real-time. Data from many MoBiMets deployed in real occupational settings were used to demonstrate their suitability for large-scale and continued monitoring of thermal comfort in various contexts (industrial, commercial, offices, agricultural). This article describes the design and the performance of the MoBiMet. Alternative methods to determine mean radiant temperature (T-mrt) using a light intensity sensor and a contactless infrared thermopile were tested next to a custom-made black globe thermometer. Performance was assessed by comparing the MoBiMet to an independent mid-cost thermal comfort sensor. It was demonstrated that networked MoBiMets can detect differences of thermal comfort at different workplaces within the same building, and between workplaces in different companies in the same city. The MoBiMets can capture spatial and temporal differences of thermal comfort over the diurnal cycle, as demonstrated in offices with different stories and with different solar irradiances in a single high-rise building.

However, the existing research has tended to overlook the Comprehensive nature of scientific higher-order thinking (S-HOT) and stopped short of defining its unique features. In response, this study presents a novel model for S-HOT that synthesises five competencies. To confirm the structure of SHOT, the study developed a new questionnaire to measure students' S-HOT. The study's participants included 1,153 students from 15 junior high schools in China. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the developed S-HOT survey had satisfactory validity and reliability. Structural equation modelling was used to confirm the cause-and-effect relationships between creative thinking, critical thinking, metacognition, science self-efficacy, and scientific reasoning in the S-HOT structure. The results showed that the average score of male students was significantly higher than that of female students in creative thinking. It was also revealed that there was a correlation between the five competencies: metacognition had a significant path to scientific reasoning, science self-efficacy had a significant path to critical and creative thinking, and scientific reasoning directly affected science self-efficacy.","[Sun, He; Xie, Yueguang] Northeast Normal Univ, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, JingYue Ave, Changchun 130117, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Lavonen, Jari] Univ Helsinki, Fac Educ Sci, Helsinki, Finland","Xie, YG (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, JingYue Ave, Changchun 130117, Jilin, Peoples R China.",xyg6367@126.com,,"Lavonen, Jari/0000-0003-2781-7953",National Social Science Fund of China [BCA190074],"Fundings The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work is supported by The National Social Science Fund of China under grant number BCA190074","Amsel E, 2008, COGNITIVE DEV, V23, P452, DOI 10.1016/j.cogdev.2008.09.00; Anderson LW, 2001, TAXONOMY LEARNING T; [Anonymous], 2012, PENGEMBANGAN KREATI; Bailin S., 2002, SCI ED, V11, P361, DOI DOI 10.1023/A:101604260862; Ballen CJ, 2017, CBE-LIFE SCI EDUC, V16, DOI 10.1187/cbe.16-12-034; Bandura A, 1997, AM J HEALTH PROMOT, V12, P8, DOI 10.4278/0890-1171-12.1.; BANDURA A, 1986, J SOC CLIN PSYCHOL, V4, P359, DOI 10.1521/jscp.1986.4.3.35; Bandura A., 1986, SOCIAL FDN THOUGHT ; Bao L, 2009, SCIENCE, V323, P586, DOI 10.1126/science.116774; BARTLETT MS, 1954, J ROY STAT SOC B, V16, P29; BENTLER PM, 1990, PSYCHOL BULL, V107, P238, DOI 10.1037/0033-2909.107.2.23; Britner SL, 2006, J RES SCI TEACH, V43, P485, DOI 10.1002/tea.2013; Chen X.

Wake steering is one such method that provides control-based improvements in a quasi-static way, but this does little to fundamentally change the wake recovery process, and thus, it has limited potential. This study investigates use of another control paradigm known as dynamic wake control (DWC) to excite the mutual inductance instability between adjacent tip-vortex structures, thereby accelerating the breakdown of the structures. The current work carries this approach beyond the hypothetical by applying the excitation via turbine control vectors that already exist on all modern wind turbines: blade pitch and rotor speed control. The investigation leverages a free-vortex wake method (FVWM) that allows a thorough exploration of relevant frequencies and amplitudes of harmonic forcing for each control vector (as well as the phase difference between the vectors for a tandem configuration) while still capturing the essential tip-vortex dynamics. The FVWM output feeds into a Fourier stability analysis working to pinpoint candidate DWC strategies suggesting fastest wake recovery. Near-wake length reductions of > 80% are demonstrated, although without considering inflow turbulence. Analysis is provided to interpret these predictions considering the presence of turbulence in a real atmospheric inflow.","[Brown, Kenneth; Houck, Daniel; Maniaci, David; Westergaard, Carsten; Kelley, Christopher] Sandia Natl Labs, Wind Energy Technol Dept, Albuquerque, NM 87123 USA","Brown, K (corresponding author), Sandia Natl Labs, Wind Energy Technol Dept, Albuquerque, NM 87123 USA.",kbrown1@sandia.gov; drhouck@sandia.gov; dcmania@sandia.gov; cw@westergaardsolutions.com; clkell@sandia.gov,,,Wind Energy Technologies Office of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE); U.S. DOE [DE-NA-0003525],"The Wind Energy Technologies Office of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is gratefully acknowledged for their funding support.

Here, we investigate chiral structures induced by irradiation with elliptically polarized light in thin films of four azopolymers denoted as PAZO, P-1, P1-2, which are amorphous, and P-2, which is liquid crystalline. Their formation is characterized in real time by the kinetics of azimuth rotation. The influence of the irradiation wavelength and intensity is also analyzed. The largest azimuth rotation per unit thickness is achieved in PAZO (33 degrees/mu m) and P1-2 (25 degrees/mu m). Reversibility of the chiral structures is demonstrated by a tenfold change in the direction of rotation. Our results also indicate that chiral structures formation occurs significantly faster than the induction of linear birefringence.

This is particularly important for floating wind turbines, having natural frequencies in a frequency range where the wind loads are high and large turbulent structures exist. This study shows that turbulence modelling greatly impacts the response of a 15-MW floating wind turbine. The turbulence models recommended by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) are challenged by considering two additional models: Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and an approach using input from offshore wind measurements (TIMESR). The two standard models, the Kaimal spectrum with IEC coherence model (Kaimal) and the Mann spectral tensor model (Mann), differ in their coherence formulation. This results in higher standard deviations for the surge and pitch motions, and lower for the yaw motion, when applying Kaimal in comparison to Mann. For the specific floater of this study, more damage is obtained in the mooring lines when applying Kaimal. Applying the more realistic models, LES and TIMESR, increases the range of response further, concluding that the two standard turbulence models may lead to incorrect estimations of the response of a floating wind turbine.

Its dynamic interface allows its users to accurately and interactively visualize their work, models, and results. GeoGebra employs the synthesis of three key features: modeling, visualization, and programming (MVP). Many studies have shown the positive effects of GeoGebra on the efficiency and effectiveness of learning and teaching topics related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. In this study, we discuss how GeoGebra provides an environment for learning that is very interactive and collaborative between the learner and the instructor. We also show how integrating GeoGebra into the learning scheme can help improve the skills and knowledge of school and university students in numerous advanced mathematical courses, such as calculus, mathematical statistics, linear algebra, linear programming, computer-aided design, computer-aided geometric design, analytic and projective geometry, and graphical representation. Therefore, this study shows the effectiveness of GeoGebra and its MVP key features in science and engineering, particularly in topics related to mathematics. Each key feature of GeoGebra is thoroughly analyzed, and further analyses, along with how GeoGebra can be helpful in different topics, are discussed.","[Ziatdinov, Rushan] Keimyung Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Daegu 704701, South Korea; [Valles, James R.] Prairie View A&M Univ, Dept Math, Prairie View, TX 77446 USA","Ziatdinov, R (corresponding author), Keimyung Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Daegu 704701, South Korea.",ziatdinov@kmu.ac.kr; jrvalles@pvamu.edu,,"Ziatdinov, Rushan/0000-0002-3822-4275",,,"Abramovich S, 2013, COMPUT SCH, V30, P4, DOI 10.1080/07380569.2013.76530; Akkaya A, 2011, PROCD SOC BEHV, V15, P2540, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.04.14; Akpinar Y, 2006, EDUC TECHNOL SOC, V9, P8; Aktumen M, 2013, ANTHROPOLOGIST, V16, P167, DOI 10.1080/09720073.2013.1189134; Alkhateeb M.A., 2019, INT ELECT J MATH ED, V14, P52; Ancsin G., 2013, ELECT J MATH TECHNOL, V7, P41; Anton-Sancho A, 2021, APPL SCI-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/app11241164; Attorps I, 2016, INT J MATH EDUC SCI, V47, P45, DOI 10.1080/0020739X.2015.104696; Baronte A., INVESTOPEDIA 202; Beardsley M, 2021, BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL, V52, P1455, DOI 10.1111/bjet.1310; Berger M, 2012, EDUC CHANGE, V16, P217, DOI 10.1080/16823206.2012.74575; Birgin O, 2021, J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR, V37, P925, DOI 10.1111/jcal.1253; Birgin O, 2022, INT J MATH EDUC SCI, V53, P872, DOI 10.1080/0020739X.2020.178818; Chen M., 2014, PHILOS INFORM QUALI; Costa J, 2012, INT J ED STUD MATH, V29, P10; Dikovic L, 2009, COMPUT SCI INF SYST, V6, P191, DOI 10.2298/csis0902191; Dockendorff M, 2018, INT J MATH EDUC SCI, V49, P66, DOI 10.1080/0020739X.2017.134106; Doerr H.M., 2008, RES TECHNOLOGY TEACH, P25; Dundar S, 2012, PROCD SOC BEHV, V46, P3465, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.06.08; Escuder A., 2011, INT C TECHN COLL MAT, P7; European Commission, 2017, GUID DOC GUID DEV PR, DOI 10.2760/15977; Fahlberg-Stojanovskay L, 2009, TEACH MATH APPL, V28, P69, DOI 10.1093/teamat/hrp00; Flehantov L, 2019, ICTERIA, V15, P86; Fuchsova M, 2019, EUR J CONTEMP EDUC, V8, P92, DOI 10.13187/ejced.2019.1.9; Grinshkun V, 2019, EUR J CONTEMP EDUC, V8, P25, DOI 10.13187/ejced.2019.1.2; Guncaga J, 2019, EUR J CONTEMP EDUC, V8, P69, DOI 10.13187/ejced.2019.1.6; Guncaga J, 2019, EUR J CONTEMP EDUC, V8, P52, DOI 10.13187/ejced.2019.1.5; Guney Z, 2019, EUR J CONTEMP EDUC, V8, P103, DOI 10.13187/ejced.2019.1.10; Haci?meroglu E.S., 2009, MATH STAT OPERATION, V9, P24, DOI 10.11120/msor.2009.0902002; Hampton SE, 2011, BIOSCIENCE, V61, P900, DOI 10.1525/bio.2011.61.11.; Hobri, 2019, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, V1265, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1265/1/01201; Hohenwarter M., 2007, P 2007 ICTCM C BOS; Hohenwarter M., 2007, MATH APPL, V7, P144; Hussen S, 2021, J PHYS CONF SER, V1832, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1832/1/01203; Idris N., 2006, TEACHING LEARNING M; Iriarte X, 2014, MECH MACH SCI, V19, P211, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-01836-2_2; Jupri A, 2021, ALGORITMA, V3, P; Kepceoglu I., 2016, ED RES REV, V11, P573, DOI [10.5897/ERR2016.2701, DOI 10.5897/ERR2016.2701; Kuncser C, 2012, PROCD SOC BEHV, V46, P5324, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.06.43; Kushwaha Rahul Chandra, 2013, INT J INFORM COMPUTA, V3, P17; Machromah I.

This research used an embedded mixed-method design. The subjects selected were 28 out of 98 seventh graders at a boys' junior high school in Bangkok, Thailand, who were chosen by cluster random sampling technique. The instruments, which were validated by five experts, included a questionnaire, lesson plans, exit tickets, interview protocols, and tests of critical thinking skills in polynomials. The content validity was assessed via expert judgment, and reliability was assessed by item analysis. The quality and effectiveness of the instruments were acceptable. The research results showed the following: (1) most students at all performance levels prefer activities in which they can learn from participating in classroom activities, such as games, activities with real-life applications, and activities involving listening instead of reading and writing, and (2) critical thinking skills in high-achieving and fair-achieving students were at the fair level, while those of low-achieving students were poor. Analysis was the highest critical thinking subskill among high-achieving and low-achieving students, while interpretation was the highest subskill in among fair-achieving students. Open-ended questions and activities based on students' preferences appear to be practical for developing critical thinking skills among students of all achievement levels.","[Monrat, Natthanon; Phaksunchai, Mingkhuan; Chonchaiya, Ratchanikorn] King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Fac Sci, 126 Pracha Uthit Rd, Bangkok 10140, Thailand","Phaksunchai, M (corresponding author), King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Fac Sci, 126 Pracha Uthit Rd, Bangkok 10140, Thailand.",natthanon.mon@mail.kmutt.ac.th; mingkhuan.pha@mail.kmutt.ac.th; ratchanikorn.cho@mail.kmutt.ac.th,,,Petchra Pra Jom Klao Masters Degree Research Scholarship from King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi [10/2562],The authors would like to express their great appreciation to Mr. Nandana Indananda for the facilities that supported this research.

We review some of the limitations of top-down wind-farm models, partly in light of basic atmospheric boundary-layer findings which have been coined by the late Sergej Zilitinkevich. Essentially, for the applicability of such analytical models, the wind-farm turbine hub height should be small compared to the atmospheric boundary-layer height, and very small compared to the horizontal extension of the farm and the distance to the nearest surface inhomogeneities. Possibilities and options to include recently discovered blockage effects are also discussed.","[Emeis, Stefan] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany","Emeis, S (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.",stefan.emeis@kit.edu,"Emeis, Stefan/B-6205-2008","Emeis, Stefan/0000-0001-6114-6212",German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy [0325783],"I would like to thank the Guest Editors of this Special Issue, Dmitrii Mironov, Andrey Grachev, and Alexander Baklanov, for the personal invitation to submit this paper.

Nevertheless, the diffusion of smart monitoring solutions via user-friendly graphical interfaces is still an ongoing issue subject to the need to diffuse a smart building culture and a low-cost series of solutions. This paper proposes a new low-cost IoT sensor network, exploiting Raspberry Pi and Arduino platforms, for collecting real-time data and evaluating specific thermal comfort indicators (PMV and PPD). The overall architecture was accordingly designed, including the hardware setup, the back-end and the Android user interface. Eventually, three distinct prototyping platforms were deployed for initial testing of the general system, and we analysed the obtained results for different building typologies and seasonal periods, based on collected data and users' preferences.

Numerous trials yielding contradicting results. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to ascertain the overall effect of RME and to examine the moderator variables in order to explore the consequences. The ERIC database, Sage publications, Springer publications, semantic scholars, and Google scholars were used to identify empirical data. The study examined 54 effect sizes from 38 individual studies conducted in the past two decades, involving 6140 participants. The estimation procedure was according to the random effects model, and statistical calculations were performed using the CMA program. According to the research findings, the study's overall effect size was 0.97. This suggests that implementing RME has a significant favourable influence on pupils' mathematical abilities. Moderator variables analysis shows that RME implementation would be more efficient when considering sample size, intervention length, learning mix, and education level. This finding contributes to the future implementation of RME to consider those variables that are shown to moderate the studies' effect sizes.

This may lead to cost-savings and, consequently, additional consumption with environmental impacts (rebound effects). In this study, a supervised machine-learning model (i.e. an application of random forest regression) is developed to quantify consumption rebound effects. In contrast to previous approaches, it is a versatile method, which allows to estimate any income-related rebound at household level considering specific household properties and the entire profile of consumption. Socio-economic properties (e.g. income, age group) of the households are used as the independent properties for the regressor to detect the dependent consumption expenses of the households. Thus, this method can be used as a bottom-up study for understanding rebounds and developing targeted measures to prevent or reduce rebound effects. To illustrate the application of the method, it is applied to the case of cooperative housing in Switzerland. In addition to environmental goals, the cooperative aims to provide affordable housing, and the reduced rent increases the disposable income of tenants. The results show that households tend to spend the 'extra' income on housing (e.g. for larger apartments) and travel. For the former, the cooperative already has a policy in place regulating the apartment area permitted per person, which delimits induced environmental impacts. For the latter, households with lower income particularly spend their extra-money on purchase and operation of vehicles, while high-erincome groups rather spend it on recreation and package holidays. Travel, housing, clothing and personal care products have highest emissions per Swiss Franc (similar to 0.3-0.6 kg CO2-eq/CHF). Thus, it is recommended to provide incentives for shifting these expenses to other consumption, to avoid jeopardizing environmental goals. The method was also used for a range of other applications e.g. rebounds due to energy-efficient devices to illustrate its versatility.","[Shinde, Rhythima; Froemelt, Andreas; Kim, Aleksandra; Hellweg, Stefanie] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn Ecol Syst Design, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, John von Neumann Weg 9, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Froemelt, Andreas] Singapore ETH Ctr CREATE, Future Cities Lab Global, Zurich Hub, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kim, Aleksandra] Paul Scherrer Inst, Technol Assessment Grp, Forschungsstr 111, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland","Shinde, R (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn Ecol Syst Design, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, John von Neumann Weg 9, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",shinde@ifu.baug.ethz.ch; froemelt@ifu.baug.ethz.ch; aleksandra.kim@psi.ch; stefanie.hellweg@ifu.baug.ethz.ch,"Hellweg, Stefanie/AAA-7756-2019; Froemelt, Andreas/F-3078-2015","Hellweg, Stefanie/0000-0001-6376-9878; Froemelt, Andreas/0000-0001-9388-7816; Shinde, Rhythima/0000-0003-3435-3202; , Aleksandra/0000-0001-7556-2233",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [407340_172445],"Rhythima Shinde and Aleksandra Kim were supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) Grant-407340_172445 within the framework of the National Research Program Sustainable Economy: resource-friendly, future-oriented, innovative (NRP73) .

Therefore, there is a need to describe this flexibility in a concise manner. For the characterization of building energy flexibility, flexibility factors can be used. The comparison of a selection of existing flexibility factors shows that they are not easy to use or understand for designers and users. A simplification is necessary. The aim of this study is to introduce a flexibility classification that is easy to understand and shows in an easy way if a building already uses the lowest energy cost level or if further improvement is possible. The classification expresses the annual energy costs in colored classes: green (class A) for lowest up to red (class D) for highest level. Basically, the flexibility classes can be derived for any metric of interest, in this paper examples are shown for energy costs and CO2eq emissions. The results given are based on the simulation of load management scenarios with different penalty signals applied for the heat pump operation of a residential building.","[Hall, Monika] Univ Appl Sci & Arts Northwestern, Inst Sustainabil & Energy Construct, CH-4132 Muttenz, Switzerland","Hall, M (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci & Arts Northwestern, Inst Sustainabil & Energy Construct, CH-4132 Muttenz, Switzerland.",monika.hall@fhnw.ch; achim.geissler@fhnw.ch,,"Hall, Monika/0000-0003-4519-6038",Swiss Federal Office of Energy SFOE [BFE SI/501240-1],FundingThe work described in this paper was funded by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy SFOE under contract number BFE SI/501240-1 as a contribution to IEA Annex 67 Energy Flexible Buildings.,"[Anonymous], 2019, STAT HAUSHALTSSTROM; [Anonymous], 2015, RAUM EN GE; [Anonymous], 2007, 137862007 SN EN IS; Arteconi A, 2012, APPL ENERG, V93, P371, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.12.04; Clarke J., ENERGY SYSTEMS RES ; D'hulst R, 2015, APPL ENERG, V155, P79, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.05.10; Dar UI, 2014, ENERG BUILDINGS, V69, P74, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.10.01; Denholm P, 2011, ENERG POLICY, V39, P1817, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2011.01.01; EHPA, EUROPEAN HEAT PUMP ; European Commission, EU CLIM ACT EUR GRE; Finck C, 2018, APPL ENERG, V209, P409, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.11.03; Hall M., 2014, SI500217 BF; Hall M., 2015, P CISBAT 2015 INT C, P57; Hall M, 2021, J PHYS CONF SER, V2042, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/01203; Hall M, 2015, BAUPHYSIK, V37, P115, DOI 10.1002/bapi.20151001; Hall M, 2014, BAUPHYSIK, V36, P117, DOI 10.1002/bapi.20141002; Hoffmann C., 2018, P 4 BPSA ENGL C BUIL, P23; IEA, REN 2019 MARK AN FO; International Energy Agency (IEA), 2019, EBC ANN 67 EX EN FL; Johra H, 2019, J PHYS CONF SER, V1343, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1343/1/01206; Johra H, 2019, ENERG BUILDINGS, V183, P325, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.11.01; Johra H, 2017, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V69, P19, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2016.11.14; Junker RG, 2018, APPL ENERG, V225, P175, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.03; Kelly N., 2015, EFFECT HOT WATER USE, P129; Kelly NJ, 2011, ENERG BUILDINGS, V43, P239, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2010.09.01; Klein K, 2017, APPL ENERG, V203, P917, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.06.07; Koskela J, 2019, APPL ENERG, V239, P1175, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.02.02; Le Dreau J, 2016, ENERGY, V111, P991, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2016.05.07; Li H, ADV APPL ENERGY, V3, DOI [10.1016/J.ADAPEN.2021.100054, DOI 10.1016/J.ADAPEN.2021.100054; Lopes RA, 2016, ENRGY PROCED, V91, P1053, DOI 10.1016/j.egypro.2016.06.27; Masson-Delmotte V., 2018, CLIMATE CHANGE PHY; Reynders G, 2018, ENERG BUILDINGS, V166, P372, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.02.04; SIA, 2010, KLIM BAUPH EN GEB S; SIA 380, 2015, 380 SI; Six D., 2011, P 21 INT C EL DIST; Turner WJN, 2015, ENERGY, V82, P1057, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2015.02.01; Vigna I, 2018, SUSTAIN CITIES SOC, V38, P526, DOI 10.1016/j.scs.2018.01.03; Vuarnoz D, 2018, DATA BRIEF, V21, P1026, DOI 10.1016/j.dib.2018.10.09; Wang AD, 2018, APPL ENERG, V232, P89, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.18; Weiss T, 2019, IOP C SER EARTH ENV, V323, DOI 10.1088/1755-1315/323/1/01200; Weiss T., 2019, TOOL EVALUATE ENERG; Wellig B, 2017, P 12 IEA HEAT PUMP C, P",42,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,DEC,2021.0,14.0,24,,,,,,,8391,10.3390/en14248391,,19,Energy & Fuels,Energy & Fuels,YB4NQ,WOS:000738991600001,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.008603031544448997,2.819144593865722e-15,0.033667656467263773,0.05977568811832697,0.033667656467263773

In this article, we focus on geometric thinking and the solutions for geometric tasks through a study of future teachers of primary education. The research sample consisted of 59 master's students from the Teacher Training for Primary Education (TTPE) program. To determine the level of geometric thinking of TTPE students, the van Hiele geometric test was used. Two geometric multi-item tasks were proposed and the students' solutions to these tasks were quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. The main goal was to analyze students' misconceptions while solving tasks and to compare and reveal the connections between their solutions and their achieved level of geometric thinking. A statistical implicative analysis was used for a deeper analysis, namely the statistical software C.H.I.C. The research findings show that more than 40% of TTPE students in the research sample did not reach the required level of geometric thinking. The achieved level of the geometric thinking of students is also influenced by the type of high school education. We observed problems with understanding the concept of the triangle and square in TTPE students. The connections between the solutions of two geometric tasks and the achieved level of geometric thinking were also revealed.","[Pavlovicova, Gabriela; Bockova, Veronika] Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Dept Math, Nitra 94901, Slovakia","Pavlovicova, G (corresponding author), Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Dept Math, Nitra 94901, Slovakia.",gpavlovicova@ukf.sk; veronika.bockova@ukf.sk,"Pavlovičová, Gabriela/AAC-4560-2020","Pavlovičová, Gabriela/0000-0001-8846-6910", [UGA: VII/3/2021];  [KEGA: 019UKF-4/2020];  [APVV-20-0599],"This paper was created with support of project UGA: VII/3/2021, project KEGA: 019UKF-4/2020 and project APVV-20-0599.","Andini S, 2018, J PHYS CONF SER, V983, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/983/1/01209; Armah R.

Most employees were forced to work from home. People suddenly had to share common living spaces with family members for longer periods of time and convert home spaces into workplaces. This inevitably had a subjective impact on the perception, satisfaction and preference of indoor environmental quality and work productivity. A web-based survey was designed and administered to Italian employees to determine how they perceived the indoor environmental quality of residential spaces when Working From Home (WFH) and to investigate the relationship between different aspects of users' satisfaction. A total of 330 valid questionnaires were collected and analysed. The article reports the results of the analyses conducted using a descriptive approach and predictive models to quantify comfort in living spaces when WFH, focusing on respondents' satisfaction. Most of them were satisfied with the indoor environmental conditions (89% as the sum of very satisfied and satisfied responses for thermal comfort, 74% for visual comfort, 68% for acoustic quality and 81% for indoor air quality), while the layout of the furniture negatively influenced the WFH experience: 45% of the participants expressed an unsatisfactory or neutral opinion. The results of the sentiment analysis confirmed this trend. Among the Indoor Environmental factors that affect productivity, visual comfort is the most relevant variable. As for the predictive approach using machine learning, the Support Vector Machine classifier performed best in predicting overall satisfaction.","[Salamone, Francesco; Barozzi, Benedetta; Bellazzi, Alice; Belussi, Lorenzo; Danza, Ludovico; Devitofrancesco, Anna; Ghellere, Matteo; Meroni, Italo; Scamoni, Fabio; Scrosati, Chiara] Natl Res Council Italy ITC CNR, Construct Technol Inst, Via Lombardia 49, I-20098 Milan, Italy","Salamone, F (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy ITC CNR, Construct Technol Inst, Via Lombardia 49, I-20098 Milan, Italy.",salamone@itc.cnr.it; barozzi@itc.cnr.it; bellazzi@itc.cnr.it; belussi@itc.cnr.it; danza@itc.cnr.it; devitofrancesco@itc.cnr.it; ghellere@itc.cnr.it; meroni@itc.cnr.it; scamoni@itc.cnr.it; scrosati@itc.cnr.it,"Salamone, Francesco/O-4213-2015; Danza, Ludovico/B-6954-2015; Scrosati, Chiara/J-8649-2016; belussi, lorenzo/C-7504-2017","Salamone, Francesco/0000-0003-3215-3979; Danza, Ludovico/0000-0003-3305-4008; Barozzi, Benedetta/0000-0001-7310-4343; BELLAZZI, ALICE/0000-0002-2861-8094; Scrosati, Chiara/0000-0003-3888-7826; Devitofrancesco, Anna/0000-0003-3491-5543; belussi, lorenzo/0000-0002-1341-0602",,,"[Anonymous], 2011, ISTAT 15 CENSIMENTO, V2, P; Arens, 2002, INDOOR AIR, P13; Bartalucci C, 2020, NOISE MAPP, V7, P199, DOI 10.1515/noise-2020-001; Berquist J, 2019, BUILD ENVIRON, V150, P88, DOI 10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.12.06; Boerstra A, 2013, ARCHIT SCI REV, V56, P30, DOI 10.1080/00038628.2012.74429; Brodeur A, 2021, J PUBLIC ECON, V193, DOI 10.1016/j.jpubeco.2020.10434; Candido C., P 9 WINDS C MAK COMF, P121; Charalampous M, 2019, EUR J WORK ORGAN PSY, V28, P51, DOI 10.1080/1359432X.2018.154188; Choi J.H., 2009, P 9 INT C HLTH BUIL; CIPD, 2014, HR GETT SMART AG WOR, V1st, P; Crosbie T., 2004, SOC POLICY SOC, V3, P22; Cruz R, 2016, IEEE IJCNN, P2182, DOI 10.1109/IJCNN.2016.772746; Danza L, 2020, BUILD ENVIRON, V183, DOI 10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.10715; European Union, 2018, WAST STAT, P; Felstead A, 2017, NEW TECH WORK EMPLOY, V32, P195, DOI 10.1111/ntwe.1209; Frontczak M, 2012, INDOOR AIR, V22, P119, DOI 10.1111/j.1600-0668.2011.00745.; Gabrieli G, 2020, SENSORS-BASEL, V20, DOI 10.3390/s2023677; Graham A., 2020, BUILD CITIES, V2, P166, DOI [10.5334/bc.76, DOI 10.5334/BC.76; He H, 2013, IMBALANCED LEARNING: FOUNDATIONS, ALGORITHMS, AND APPLICATIONS, P1, DOI 10.1002/978111864610; He SY, 2015, TRAVEL BEHAV SOC, V2, P131, DOI 10.1016/j.tbs.2014.12.00; Hutto C, 2014, P 8 INT C WEBLOGS SO, P21; ISO, 2019, 105512019 IS; ISO, 2012, 288022012 IS; Kwon M, 2019, BUILD ENVIRON, V157, P356, DOI 10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.05.00; Lee JY, 2010, APPL ERGON, V41, P282, DOI 10.1016/j.apergo.2009.07.00; Lo A, 2015, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V112, P13892, DOI 10.1073/pnas.151828511; Luo MH, 2020, ENERG BUILDINGS, V210, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2020.10977; Ouf Mohamed, 2019, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, V609, DOI 10.1088/1757-899X/609/4/04209; Palmi P., 2020, OPEN REV MANAG BAN; Pastore L, 2019, BUILD ENVIRON, V150, P60, DOI 10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.01.00; Pedregosa F, 2011, J MACH LEARN RES, V12, P282; Provoost S, 2019, FRONT PSYCHOL, V10, DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.0106; Rupietta K, 2018, SCHMALENBACH BUS REV, V70, P25, DOI 10.1007/s41464-017-0043-; Salamone F, 2021, J PHYS CONF SER, V2042, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/01213; Salata F, 2018, ENVIRON RES, V167, P115, DOI 10.1016/j.envres.2018.07.01; Sarran L, 2020, BUILD ENVIRON, V179, DOI 10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.10694; Shareena P., 2020, GLOBAL J RES ANAL, V9, P1, DOI 10.36106/gjr; Shmueli G, 2010, STAT SCI, V25, P289, DOI 10.1214/10-STS33; Suh A, 2017, INTERNET RES, V27, P140, DOI 10.1108/IntR-06-2015-018; Sun SL, 2017, INFORM FUSION, V36, P10, DOI 10.1016/j.inffus.2016.10.00; Tatsat H., 2021, MACHINE LEARNING DA; Garcia MV, 2020, ECOL INFORM, V56, DOI 10.1016/j.ecoinf.2019.10103; Vega RP, 2015, J BUS PSYCHOL, V30, P313, DOI 10.1007/s10869-014-9359-; Wong LT, 2008, BUILD ENVIRON, V43, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.buildenv.2007.01.00; Xiao YJ, 2021, J OCCUP ENVIRON MED, V63, P181, DOI 10.1097/JOM.000000000000209; Zhang J., 2016, INT J BUS MANAG, V11, P40, DOI DOI 10.5539/IJBM.V11N2P4; 2013, THERMAL ENV CONDITI",47,2,2,10,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-5309,,BUILDINGS-BASEL,BUILDINGS-BASEL,DEC,2021.0,11.0,12,,,,,,,660,10.3390/buildings11120660,,31,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,XX0BR,WOS:000735973300001,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.00962720196640721,6.774414381524502e-10,0.035599838676037006,0.08890912402112548,0.02851883949948367

For the scope of aeroelastic analyses, the AL model is coupled with an in-house multibody dynamics code in which the blades are modeled as beams. The advantage from the introduction of CFD analysis in rotorcraft aeroelasticity is related to its capability to account in detail for the interaction of the rotor wake with the boundary layer developed on the surrounding bodies. This has proven to be of great importance in order to accurately estimate the aerodynamic forces and thus the corresponding structural loads and deflections of the blades. In wind turbine applications, a good example of the above is the rotor/ground interaction. In helicopter configurations, the interaction of MR with the ground or the fuselage and the interaction of tail rotor with the duct in fenestron configurations are typical examples. Furthermore, CFD aerodynamic analysis is an obvious modeling option in which the above mentioned asset can be combined with the consideration of the mutual interaction of the rotor with the ambient turbulence. A WT rotor operating inside the atmospheric boundary layer under turbulent free-stream flow is such a case. In the paper, AL results are compared against Blade Element Momentum (BEM) and Lifting Line (LL) model results in the case of the WT, whereas LL and measured data are considered in the helicopter cases. Blade loads and deflections are mainly compared as azimuthal variations. In the helicopter MR cases, where comparison is made against experimental data, harmonic analysis of structural loads is shown as well. Overall, AL proves to be as reliable as LL in the canonical cases addressed in this paper in terms of loads and deflections predictions. Therefore, it can be trusted in more complex flow conditions where viscous effects are pronounced.","[Spyropoulos, Nikos; Prospathopoulos, John M.; Riziotis, Vasilis A.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, GR-15780 Athens, Greece; [Papadakis, George] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Naval & Marine Engn, GR-15780 Athens, Greece","Spyropoulos, N; Riziotis, VA (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, GR-15780 Athens, Greece.",nspyro@fluid.mech.ntua.gr; papis@fluid.mech.ntua.gr; jprosp@fluid.mech.ntua.gr; vasilis@fluid.mech.ntua.gr,,"Prospathopoulos, John/0000-0003-3318-8807; Papadakis, George/0000-0002-2742-5258; Riziotis, Vasilis/0000-0003-0104-1608; Spyropoulos, Nikolaos/0000-0001-9236-8133",Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI) under the HFRI PhD Fellowship grant [797];  [pr005019_thin];  [pr010013_thin],The research work was supported by the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI) under the HFRI PhD Fellowship grant (Fellowship Number: 797).,"Andronikos T, 2021, APPL SCI-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/app1121993; Andronikos T, 2021, AEROSP SCI TECHNOL, V113, DOI 10.1016/j.ast.2021.10669; Bagherpoura T, 2018, COMPOS STRUCT, V193, P237, DOI 10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.03.07; Bak C, 2013, DANISH WIND POWER RE, V201; Bathe K.J, 1996, FINITE ELEMENT PROCE, Vfirs; Bauchau OA, 2001, MATH COMPUT MODEL, V33, P1113, DOI 10.1016/S0895-7177(00)00303-; Bertagnolio F., 2001, STATUS 2 DIMENSIONAL, V128; Biedron R., 2010, P 47 AIAA AER SCI M, P136; Buhler M, 2018, J PHYS CONF SER, V1037, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1037/6/06200; Churchfield MJ., 2017, 35 WIND EN S, P1, DOI [10.2514/6.2017-1998, DOI 10.2514/6.2017-1998; Clough RW., 1993, DYNAMICS STRUCTURE; Dag KO, 2020, WIND ENERGY, V23, P148, DOI 10.1002/we.241; Delorme Y, 2021, AEROSP SCI TECHNOL, V108, DOI 10.1016/j.ast.2020.10640; Fancev T., 1996, NISA FEM SUPPORT SE; Glauert H., 1935, AERODYNAMIC THEORY, VIV, P169, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-91487-4_; Hodgson EL, 2021, J PHYS CONF SER, V1934, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1934/1/01201; Ivanell S, 2009, WIND ENERGY, V12, P63, DOI 10.1002/we.28; Jason Jonkman, 2009, DEFINITION 5 MW REFE, DOI DOI 10.2172/94742; Jha P, 2013, 51 AIAA AER SCI M IN, P60; Jha PK, 2018, J FLUID MECH, V834, DOI 10.1017/jfm.2017.79; Jha PK, 2014, J SOL ENERG-T ASME, V136, DOI 10.1115/1.402625; Jonkman J., 2005, FAST USERS GUID; Karypis George, 1997, METIS SOFTWARE PACK; Truong KV, 2017, AEROSPACE-BASEL, V4, DOI 10.3390/aerospace402002; Langer H.J., 2005, P 31 EUR ROT FOR FL; Langtry RB, 2006, J TURBOMACH, V128, P423, DOI 10.1115/1.218435; Madsen H.A., 2010, SCI MAK TORQUE WIND, P; Manolas DI, 2015, J COMPUT NONLIN DYN, V10, DOI 10.1115/1.402768; Manolas D.I., 2015, P EUR WIND EN ASS A; Meng H, 2018, RENEW ENERG, V116, P423, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2017.08.07; MENTER FR, 1994, AIAA J, V32, P1598, DOI 10.2514/3.1214; Merabet R., 2021, ACTUATOR LINE METHO; Motta-Mena J., 2014, P 32 ASME WIND EN S, P071; Nanos EM, 2020, J PHYS CONF SER, V1618, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1618/2/02204; Papadakis G., 2014, THESIS NTUA ATHEN; Papadakis G, 2019, COMPUT FLUIDS, V195, DOI 10.1016/j.compfluid.2019.10432; Papadakis G, 2014, J PHYS CONF SER, V524, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/524/1/01212; PETOT D, 1989, RECH AEROSPATIALE, P5; Prandtl L, 1921, APPL MODERN HYDRODY; Riziotis V.A., 2008, EUR WIND EN C EXH 20, V1, P10; Riziotis V.A., 1997, EW C, P44; Riziotis V.A., 2010, EUR WIND EN C EXH, V2, P117; ROE PL, 1986, ANNU REV FLUID MECH, V18, P337, DOI 10.1146/annurev.fl.18.010186.00200; Shen WZ, 2005, J SOL ENERG-T ASME, V127, P209, DOI 10.1115/1.185048; Shives M, 2013, WIND ENERGY, V16, P1183, DOI 10.1002/we.154; Shur ML, 2008, INT J HEAT FLUID FL, V29, P1638, DOI 10.1016/j.ijheatfluidflow.2008.07.00; Smith M.

However, this may be challenging in mature wind energy markets, where many advantageous wind locations are already engaged by older wind farms, potentially generating suboptimal wind harvesting. This research developed a novel method to systematically analyze diverse factors to determine the level of maturity of wind markets and evaluate the adequacy of wind farm repowering at regional and individual levels. The approach was applied to wind markets in the United States (U.S.), in which several states were identified as having diverse levels of maturity. Results obtained from case studies in Texas indicated a consequential number of wind farms that have reached their twenty-year end-of-life term and earlier obsolescence levels. The proposed approach aided in determining wind farms that may benefit from total or partial repowering. The method indicated that total repowering of selected installations would significantly increase overall wind energy generation, considering that these older installations have access to some of the best wind speeds, infrastructure and areas to grow. The proposed method can be applied to different world wind markets.","[Haces-Fernandez, Francisco] Texas A&M Univ Kingsville, Coll Business Adm, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA","Haces-Fernandez, F (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ Kingsville, Coll Business Adm, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA.",Francisco.HacesFernandez@tamuk.edu,"Haces-Fernandez, Francisco/R-4649-2017","Haces-Fernandez, Francisco/0000-0001-8997-4095","College of Business Administration 2021-2022 Summer Research Grant at Texas A&M University, Kingsville","This research was funded by the College of Business Administration 2021-2022 Summer Research Grant at Texas A&M University, Kingsville.","Abraham J., 2015, GUARDIAN 121; Al Katsaprakakis D, 2021, ENERGIES, V14, DOI 10.3390/en1418597; [Anonymous], 2019, DTSCH WELL; Arvesen A, 2012, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V16, P5994, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2012.06.02; Baheta AT, 2019, SPRINGERBR APPL SCI, P73, DOI 10.1007/978-981-13-2357-7_; BTS-Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2020, N AM RAIL LI; Silvosa AC, 2013, ENG ECON, V58, P282, DOI 10.1080/0013791X.2013.81473; Chaurasiya PK, 2019, ENERGY STRATEG REV, V24, P342, DOI 10.1016/j.esr.2019.04.01; Colmenar-Santos A, 2015, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V41, P319, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2014.08.04; de Bona JC, 2021, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V135, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2020.11019; de Mello E, 2021, J PHYS CONF SER, V2018, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/01201; DE-U.S. Department of Energy, 2015, DOEGO102015455; del Rio P, 2011, ENERG POLICY, V39, P1897, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2010.12.03; DTU-Technical University of Denmark, 2020, GLOB WIND ATL 3 0 T; Enevoldsen P, 2019, ENERGY SUSTAIN DEV, V50, P18, DOI 10.1016/j.esd.2019.02.00; Enevoldsen P, 2016, ENERGY SUSTAIN DEV, V35, P41, DOI 10.1016/j.esd.2016.10.00; Haces-Fernandez F.H., 2017, IIE ANN C P, P10; Haces-Fernandez F, 2020, ENERGIES, V13, DOI 10.3390/en1322601; Han W, 2018, RENEW ENERG, V115, P817, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2017.09.00; HIFLD-Homeland Infrastructure Foundation Level Data, 2019, ELECT POWER TRANSMI; Howley M., 2021, WIND GENERATION IRE; Hughes G., 2012, RENEW ENERGY FOUND, P4; IPCC-United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2021, 6 ASS RE; Ramirez FJ, 2018, J CLEAN PROD, V196, P1198, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.06.10; Kaldellis JK, 2017, RENEW ENERG, V108, P72, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2017.02.03; Krah K., 2020, NRELTP7A407677; Lacal-Arantegui R, 2020, WIND ENERGY, V23, P660, DOI 10.1002/we.245; Lantz E., 2013, NRELTP6A2060535, DOI 10.2172/111705; Lee N., 2017, NRELTP7A406904; Madlener R, 2019, ENERGIES, V12, DOI 10.3390/en1224470; Mai T.T., 2017, NRELTP6A207003; Malewitz J., 2021, TEXAS TRIBUNE 101; Masson-Delmonte V., 2021, CLIMATE CHANGE 202; Mollasalehi E, 2017, ENERGIES, V10, DOI 10.3390/en1011185; Olauson J, 2017, WIND ENERGY, V20, P2049, DOI 10.1002/we.213; Oroschakoff K., 2018, EU POLITICO 122; Piel J.

For narrow (1-4 mm horizontal extent) domains, we demonstrate active instabilities that are uniquely double-diffusive, or in other words that no instabilities develop when differential diffusion is not present. The novel double-diffusive instabilities are influenced by the boundaries, but demonstrate complex time-dependent evolution down to lateral extents of 1.25 mm. We quantify the energetics, the horizontal asymmetry, and the buoyancy flux due to the instability. We utilize these results to characterize the instability within regimes and point out that while coherent instabilities associated with larger gaps are well characterized by the ratio of diffusive effects to buoyancy forces (the time dependent Grashof number), for smaller gap widths, regime characterization is more difficult. Nevertheless, even at a gap of 1.25 mm, the instability remains robust, and thus it can be concluded that double diffusion can be employed to drive localized mixing in highly confined settings for which single constituent Rayleigh-Taylor does not manifest.","[Legare, Sierra; Grace, Andrew; Stastna, Marek] Univ Waterloo, Dept Appl Math, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Legare, S (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Appl Math, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",slegare@uwaterloo.ca,,"Legare, Sierra/0000-0003-2341-4305; Grace, Andrew/0000-0001-9616-025X; Stastna, Marek/0000-0003-1770-2044",NSERC Discovery Grant [RGPIN-311844-37157],This work was supported by NSERC Discovery Grant No. RGPIN-311844-37157.,"Alqatari S, 2020, SCI ADV, V6, DOI 10.1126/sciadv.abd660; Angeli C, 2005, INT J HEAT MASS TRAN, V48, P4633, DOI 10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2005.05.02; BAINES WD, 1969, J FLUID MECH, V37, P51, DOI 10.1017/S002211206900041; Brydon D, 1999, J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS, V104, P1537, DOI 10.1029/1998JC90005; CALDWELL DR, 1981, DEEP-SEA RES, V28, P1605, DOI 10.1016/0198-0149(81)90100-; Coutino A., 2021, THESI; Deepwell D, 2017, PHYS FLUIDS, V29, DOI 10.1063/1.499459; Ghorayeb K, 1997, PHYS FLUIDS, V9, P2339, DOI 10.1063/1.86935; GREGG MC, 1972, DEEP-SEA RES, V19, P355, DOI 10.1016/0011-7471(72)90079-; Harnanan S, 2015, PHYS FLUIDS, V27, DOI 10.1063/1.490629; HUPPERT HE, 1984, ANNU REV EARTH PL SC, V12, P1; Jevons W., 1857, DUBLIN PHILOS MAG 4, V14, P2; Kerr OS, 2021, J FLUID MECH, V909, DOI 10.1017/jfm.2020.97; Kerr OS, 2019, J FLUID MECH, V859, P126, DOI 10.1017/jfm.2018.82; KERR OS, 1991, J FLUID MECH, V225, P333, DOI 10.1017/S002211209100207; Kimura S, 2007, GEOPHYS RES LETT, V34, DOI 10.1029/2007GL03193; Koberinski A, 2015, PHYS FLUIDS, V27, DOI 10.1063/1.492841; Kundu P K, 2002, FLUID MECH-SOV RE; Love AJ, 2007, WATER RESOUR RES, V43, DOI 10.1029/2007WR00600; MCDOUGALL TJ, 1983, J FLUID MECH, V133, P321, DOI 10.1017/S002211208300194; McDougall TJ, 2003, J ATMOS OCEAN TECH, V20, P730, DOI 10.1175/1520-0426(2003)20<730:AACEAF>2.0.CO;; Merceret F.

However, the knowledge regarding differences in polarimetric signatures of different tissue pathologies is very scattered, confounding the deduction of a global trend of the polarimetric variables for healthy and pathological tissues. The purpose of this study was to bridge this gap. We conducted a rigorous online survey to collect all published studies that report the two most common polarimetric variables (i.e., depolarization and retardance) for any type of tissue pathology. A total of 101 studies describing the polarimetric assessment of tissues were collected, wherein 253 (i.e., n(human) = 149, n(animal) = 104) different type of tissues were optically characterized. Most tissue samples (172/253) were investigated in ex vivo settings. The data showed 32 different types of tissues pathologies, where the most common pathology was cancer and its subtypes. The skin tissues were the most frequently explored tissues, followed by tissue samples from breast, colon, liver, and cervix. Although differences in polarimetric signatures of different tissue pathologies were summarized from the included studies, generalization of the results was hindered by the presentation of polarimetric data in a non-uniform format. The analyses presented in this study may provide an important reference for future polarimetric studies that conduct optical assessment of tissues at greater depth, particularly in the context of optical biopsy/digital staining.","[Ali, Zahra;

As the investigation of a rotating turbine can be challenging, both experimentally and numerically, static actuator discs can substitute rotating turbines. To investigate the similarity of the turbulence in the wakes and how turbulent inflow alters the result, an experimental wind tunnel study is presented that compares hot-wire measurements in the central wakes of an actuator disc and a model wind turbine (diameter-based Reynolds number Re z 300000). Two turbulent inflows are investigated, an intermittent, i.e. gusty, atmospheric-like inflow generated by an active grid, and a non-intermittent inflow generated by a regular grid. The data is investigated using one-point and higher-order two-point statistics. We find that the wakes of both models have similar properties for all investigated quantities within the far wake. The turbulence in the central wake is in-dependent of the inflow conditions, and both models filter larger scale intermittency in the far wake with regard to the inflow. Also, we find that the turbine generates its own kind of turbulence that dominates the ambient turbulence and has strong features of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is one of the new technologies rapidly and increasingly grabbing the attention of businesses. RPA tools allow mimicking human tasks by providing a virtual workforce, or digital workers in the form of software bots, for automating manual, high-volume, repetitive, and routine tasks. The goal is to allow human workers to delegate their tedious routine tasks to a software bot, thus allowing them to focus on more difficult tasks. RPA tools are simple and very powerful, according to cost-saving and other performance metrics. However, the main challenge of RPA implementation is to effectively determine the business tasks suitable for automation. This paper provides a methodology for selecting candidate tasks for robotic process automation based on user interface logs and process mining techniques.","[Choi, Daehyoun; Cho, Chiwoon] Univ Ulsan, Sch Ind Engn, Ulsan 44610, South Korea; [R'bigui, Hind] Nsoft Co Ltd, Digital Enterprise Dept, 407,14 Tekeunosaneop Ro 55beon Gil, Ulsan 44776, South Korea","Cho, C (corresponding author), Univ Ulsan, Sch Ind Engn, Ulsan 44610, South Korea.;R'bigui, H (corresponding author), Nsoft Co Ltd, Digital Enterprise Dept, 407,14 Tekeunosaneop Ro 55beon Gil, Ulsan 44776, South Korea.",dhchoi@nsoft.co.kr; hind@nsoft.co.kr; chiwoon6@mail.ulsan.ac.kr,,"Cho, Chiwoon/0000-0002-8506-8367; R'BIGUI, HIND/0000-0002-7533-0210",,,"Aguirre S, 2017, COMM COM INF SC, V742, P65, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-66963-2_; [Anonymous], 2021, GVR168038145; [Anonymous], 2019, AM J INTELL SYST, DOI DOI 10.5923/J.AJIS.20190902.0; Balakrishnan S., 2021, 2021 7th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems (ICACCS), P1881, DOI 10.1109/ICACCS51430.2021.944199; Bourgouin A, 2018, INT CONF E BUS ENG, P46, DOI 10.1109/ICEBE.2018.0001; Choubey A., 2021, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, V1911, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1911/1/01201; Coccia M., 2017, J EC SOCIAL THOUGHT, V4, P437, DOI [10.1453/jest.v4i4.1511, DOI 10.1453/JEST.V4I4.1511; Coccia M., 2018, QUADERNI IRCRES CNR, V3, P3, DOI [10.23760/2499-6661.2018.001, DOI 10.23760/2499-6661.2018.001; Coccia M, 2020, TECHNOL ANAL STRATEG, V32, P1462, DOI 10.1080/09537325.2020.178541; Coccia M, 2020, J ENG TECHNOL MANAGE, V55, DOI 10.1016/j.jengtecman.2019.11.00; Coccia M, 2019, TECHNOL ANAL STRATEG, V31, P517, DOI 10.1080/09537325.2018.152338; Coccia M, 2019, TECHNOL FORECAST SOC, V141, P289, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2018.12.01; der Aalst W.M.P., 2005, ICATPN 2005 LECT NOT, V353; Ferreira D.R., 2020, PRIMER PROCESS MINI; Gavrilovskaya N.

The instrument is an open question which is distributed through an online questionnaire. The research subjects involved were 278 with the proportion consisting of science teachers (82), pre-service science teachers (109), and high school students (82). The results of the study showed that science teachers gave rise to the most concepts, then there was a decrease in the number of concepts for pre-service science teachers and finally high school students. The concept of mineral as the highest concept was put forward by science teachers, in pre-service science teachers the concepts of mineral and earth appeared the highest, while in high school students the concept of plants was the highest. These results indicate that the higher the education level, the more important concepts that can be raised about the conception of soils.

The method used in this study was a quasi-experimental with one group pre-test and post-test design. The sample of this study was 30 students from one of public senior high schools in the West Bandung Regency area. The instrument of this study was an essay for creative thinking skills. The test consisted of 11 questions with indicators of creative thinking skills according to Guilford, namely fluency, flexibility, originality and elaboration. The data were analysed by using n-gain scores and Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. The result of this study showed that there was a significant difference between the pretest and posttest scores with p-value of 0.000 and the improvement of creative thinking skills on each indicator with n-gain scores was 0.73 for fluency (high), 0.34 for flexibility (medium), 0.03 for originality (low) and 0.19 for elaboration (low). All four indicators have improved even though the improved of originality and elaboration at a low criteria.

The neoplastic lesions were developed under the influence of social stress and chemical stress using nitrosamines during a 9-month period of application. A significant fluorescence signal in the region of 670 - 720 nm was observed from the neoplastic lesions, which was absent in the normal mucosa. This signal is related to the fluorescence of phthalocyanines accumulated in the tumor area. The autofluorescence background covered the region of 450 - 650 nm with a maximum at 480 - 520 nm and originated mainly from protein cross-links and co-enzymes - NADH and flavins. Endogenous porphyrins fluorescence was also observed in the lesions with a maximum at 630 - 640 nm. Visually, the presence of accumulation sites of Pcs in the form of bright pink patches was observed after excitation at 405 nm, as opposed to a healthy tissue, which remained blue-violet due to the autofluorescence signal. This allows one to use the Pcs fluorescence discrimination not only in a spectroscopic mode of detection, but for imaging of the lesions investigated, which is preferable in clinical applications during endoscopic observations in humans.","[Agranovich, I; Khorovodov, Al; Kanevsky, M.; Semyachkina-Glushkovskaya, O.; Borisova, E.] Saratov NG Chernyshevskii State Univ, 83 Astrahanskaya Str, Saratov 410012, Russia; [Genova, Ts; Gisbrecht, Al; Borisova, E.] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Elect, 72 Tsarigradsko Chaussee, Sofia 1784, Bulgaria; [Angelov, I; Mantareva, V] Bulgarian Acad Sci BAS, Inst Organ Chem, Ctr Phytochem, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria; [Navolokin, N.] Saratov State Med Univ, Bolshaya Sadovaya Ulitsa 137, Saratov 410010, Russia","Agranovich, I (corresponding author), Saratov NG Chernyshevskii State Univ, 83 Astrahanskaya Str, Saratov 410012, Russia.",ilana.agranovich@yandex.ru,"Agranovich, Ilana/AAA-4329-2022; Genova, Tsanislava/L-3876-2016","Agranovich, Ilana/0000-0002-7903-3897; Mantareva, Vanya/0000-0002-7841-0910",Russian Science Foundation [18-15-00139],This work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation project #18-15-00139 Optical technologies for early diagnostics of stomach cancer.,"Benson AB, 2007, J MANAGE CARE PHARM, V13, pS; Borisova E, 2019, PROC SPIE, V11079, DOI 10.1117/12.252684; Conteduca V, 2013, INT J ONCOL, V43, P973, DOI 10.3892/ijo.2013.204; Diamond KR, 2003, PHYS MED BIOL, V48, P4135, DOI 10.1088/0031-9155/48/24/01; Dixon JM, 2005, PHOTOCHEM PHOTOBIOL, V81, P212, DOI 10.1562/2004-11-06-TSN-361.; Fujiya M, 2013, GASTROINTEST ENDOSC, V77, P111, DOI 10.1016/j.gie.2012.07.03; Jemal A, 2011, CA-CANCER J CLIN, V61, P69, DOI [10.3322/caac.20107, 10.3322/caac.20115; Lee HH, 2017, KOREAN J INTERN MED, V32, P1, DOI 10.3904/kjim.2016.20; LOZOVAYA GI, 1990, ORIGINS LIFE EVOL B, V20, P321, DOI 10.1007/BF0180811; Mantareva, 2016, PHOTONICS LASERS MED, V5, P123, DOI DOI 10.1515/plm-2016-000; Mantareva V, 2005, J PORPHYR PHTHALOCYA, V9, P47, DOI 10.1142/S108842460500009; Mantareva V, 2016, PHOTODIAGN PHOTODYN, V14, P98, DOI 10.1016/j.pdpdt.2016.02.00; Moher D, 2009, PLOS MED, V6, DOI 10.1371/journal.pmed.100009; Pavlov A, 2019, J INNOV OPT HEAL SCI, V12, DOI 10.1142/S179354581950007; Tariq K, 2016, CANCER BIOL MED, V13, P120, DOI 10.28092/j.issn.2095-3941.2015.010; Ulanova M, 2016, ADV EXP MED BIOL, V923, P135, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-38810-6_1",16,0,1,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1859.0,,,,,,,,12038,10.1088/1742-6596/1859/1/012038,,5,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Quantum Science & Technology; Optics; Physics, Applied",Engineering; Physics; Optics,BS2DU,WOS:000700377600038,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.0024506049931076732,2.372470940727251e-08,0.004589957249556279,0.06694281818088607,0.004589957249556279

In contrast to a conventional floating offshore wind turbine, it has no moorings. Instead, the propellers are used to keep the wind turbine stationary. It may also be equipped with an on-board energy storage system (e.g. batteries, hydrogen, etc.) to avoid grid-connection. This concept is well suited for deployment in the far-offshore, where grid-connection and installation operations are challenging. As the propellers which are used to control the position of the wind turbine require power supply, the aim of this study is to investigate whether and in what conditions there can be a positive net power production. To this end, we have developed a velocity and power prediction program (VPPP) to estimate the power consumed by the propellers and the power generated by the wind turbine, as a function of wind conditions, and design parameters (e.g. diameter of the wind turbine and characteristics of the propellers rotors). The VPPP is based on Newton's first law of motion. The forces applied on the system are: the wind turbine thrust, the mean wave drift, and the propellers thrust. Inspired by an existing floating offshore wind concept, an example design has been developed. The diameter of the wind turbine's rotor is 78 m. Its rated power is 2 MW. The wind turbine is mounted on a 40 m square barge. The diameter of the propellers' rotor is 6 m. Using the VPPP, the power performance of this example design has been investigated as function of wind conditions. The maximum generated power is 0.89 MW. It is obtained for a true wind speed of 13.4 m/s. If deployed in the Northern Atlantic Ocean, this design could achieve a capacity factor of 15%, which is low in comparison to the 70% capacity factor which would be achieved by a moored floating offshore wind turbine if deployed at the same location.","[Alwan, R.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Math Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Babarit, A.; Gilloteaux, J.

Specifically, based on the results of the competency aspects of 2012 PISA, the students' abilities to identify scientific problems and to use scientific evidence were in moderate category, while the students' abilities to explain the phenomena scientifically were in low category. On the other hand, based on the results of the competency aspects of 2015 and 2018 PISA, the students' abilities to explain phenomena scientific, to evaluate and design scientifically, and to interpret data and scientific evidence obtained a percentage value of 34.24%, 34.70%, and 40.15% respectively, and all of them were in very low category. The implication of this study is that the students' overall scientific literacy abilities are still very low.

Distributions of number of repairs and repair times per turbine are shared, as well as number of visits. A focus is placed on the effect of tidal access restrictions and position in the array by comparing clusters of turbines within the wind farm. It was found that tidal access restrictions lead to an increase in mean time to repair of 16%, and 0.22% decrease in technical availability. Turbines in the first few rows with reference to the prominent wind direction experience more minor failures on average, while those constantly operating in the wake of others are characterised by more major failures, and therefore a higher mean time to repair.","[Anderson, F.; Cava, D.

Thus, this study aims to determine the ability of analytical thinking and scientific attitudes of high school students in learning chemistry. This study was carried out using a quasi-experimental with post-test only design. This research was conducted in senior high school in the rate reaction topic. The sample in this study consisted of two classes, namely Class XI Science 1 as an experimental class with a problem based learning model and Class XI Science 3 as a control class with direct instruction. A total of 63 students of class XI were determined as research samples and the sampling was done by random sampling techniques. The instrument used was a test in the form of essays and non-tests used in this study were students' scientific attitude questionnaire. The MANOVA test was used to analyze differences in the abilities of analytical thinking and scientific attitudes of students in the experimental class and the control class. The results of this study indicate that the value of sig <0,05 ie 0,000 <0,05 is thus the application of the problem based model to the analytical thinking abilities and scientific attitudes of students of senior high school on the rate reaction topic.","[Andriani, R.; Supiah, Y.

The interview consists of investigating the prospective chemistry teachers' understanding using CaCO3 equilibrium system, NO2-N2O4 equilibrium system, and FeSCN2+ equilibrium system and asking about concepts that are considered troublesome according to their learning experiences. The common misconceptions on chemical equilibrium revealed by this study are about the dynamic nature of chemical equilibrium, the constancy of equilibrium constant, and the shift of equilibrium. Meanwhile, the dynamic equilibrium, the equilibrium constant, and Le Chatelier's principle are considered troublesome knowledge because they can be alien, conceptually difficult, and troublesome language.","[Andriani, Y.; Mulyani, S.; Wiji, W.] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Dept Kimia, Jl Dr Setiabudi 229, Bandung 40154, Indonesia","Andriani, Y (corresponding author), Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Dept Kimia, Jl Dr Setiabudi 229, Bandung 40154, Indonesia.",y.andriani.student@upi.edu,,,,,"Al-Balushi S., 2012, SCI ED INT, V23, P22; Bampton M, 2011, TEACHING GEOGRAPHIC, P11; Barke H D, 2008, MISCONCEPTIONS CHE; BERGQUIST W, 1990, J CHEM EDUC, V67, P1000, DOI 10.1021/ed067p100; Canpolat N., 2006, RES SCI TECHNOLOGICA, V24, P217, DOI DOI 10.1080/0263514060081161; Demirciolu G., 2013, INT J NEW TRENDS ED, V4, P19; Erdemir A, 2000, HACETTEPE NIVERSITES, V1; Gkitzia V, 2020, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V21, P307, DOI 10.1039/c8rp00301; Griffiths A.

Twenty-four respondents from four secondary schools in Yogyakarta were voluntary participated in the interview to investigate DRR program implementation. The respondents consist of school principals (8 people), and teachers (16 people). The results show that disaster preparedness education has been integrated into several school subjects such as Physics (33.33 %), Geography (20.83 %), Physical Education (16.67 %), Bahasa (12.33 %), and Natural Sciences (12.33 %), and Arts (4.17 %). About 29.17 % of the participants admitted that they still do not have enough knowledge about the risk of disaster after learning about Volcanoes Eruption, Earthquakes, and Tsunami About 41.67 % of the participants feel they know about what to do after having evacuation drills. However, 83.33 % of the participants feel unconfident that they will be able to take proper action when a disaster occurs. Thus, in reducing the risk of disaster, teaching the risk of natural disaster and how to reduce it through Physics is possible to do as contextual learning, especially for students who schooled at a disaster-prone area.","[Anggaryani, M.] Univ Negeri Surabaya, Dept Phys, Phys Educ, Surabaya, Indonesia","Anggaryani, M (corresponding author), Univ Negeri Surabaya, Dept Phys, Phys Educ, Surabaya, Indonesia.",mitaanggaryani@unesa.ac.id,"Anggaryani, Mita/AAZ-6193-2021","Anggaryani, Mita/0000-0003-4238-7816",Badan Penanggulangan Bencana Daerah (BPBD) Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta; Dinas Pendidikan Pemuda dan Kebudayaan (DPPK) Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta; Australia National Centre for Public Awareness of Science (CPAS); Australian National University (ANU); Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT),"This study is part of research on the School-based Disaster Risk Reduction Program initiated by the researcher since 2016.

The outlined control features significantly reduced tower fatigue loads by 18% and 70% in the case of a three-bladed 20MW and a two-bladed 20MW turbine, respectively.","[Anstock, Fabian; Schorbach, Vera] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Fac Engn & Comp Sci, Berliner Tor 21, D-20099 Hamburg, Germany","Anstock, F (corresponding author), Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Fac Engn & Comp Sci, Berliner Tor 21, D-20099 Hamburg, Germany.",fabian.anstock@haw-hamburg.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy [13FH1I04IA],"The presented work is part of the four-year research project \X-Rotor two-bladed wind turbines funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (reference 13FH1I04IA), whom we would here like to thank.","Anstock F, 2020, J PHYS CONF SER, V1618, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1618/2/02206; Anstock F, 2019, J PHYS CONF SER, V1356, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1356/1/01200; Bergami Leonardo, 2014, P EWE; Burton T., 2011, WIND ENERGY HDB, V2; Chaviaropoulos P.

A total of 83 students were involved as subjects in this study. A self-assessment sheet was used to evaluate the RS of prospective biology teachers from four participating universities. The self-assessment instrument for RS was adapted from Garg and Vitae which covers four domains, namely domain A (intellectual knowledge and abilities), domain B (personal effectiveness), domain C (research and organizational governance), and domain D (involvement, influence, and impact). A differential semantic scale from one (1) to nine (9) was used to measure the levels of RS domain of the respondents. The distribution of the research instrument was carried out for two months, from May 4 to June 21, 2020. Based on the study, it was found that domain A (knowledge and intellectual ability) is still weak with 35% while domain B (personal effectiveness) is the highest aspect of RS with a percentage of 49%.

Data is transformed into indicators of collaborative problem-solving skills and is categorized based on four levels namely beginner (level 1), emerging (level 2), intermediate (level 3), and advanced (level 4). The results show that students are at various levels with different characteristics in both the social domain and cognitive domain in CPS skills.

The data analysis technique used is a statistical test with a different test technique (t-test) using SPSS 23. Experimental class learning using Problem Based Learning accompanied by 3D thinking maps, whereas for the control class do not use it. The normality test results of student learning outcomes in the experimental and control classes are not normal, so the t test on student learning outcomes uses the Mann Whitney U Test. T test results of student learning outcomes that have a Sig (2-tailed) value of 0,000 then the value is below 0.05 which indicates that Ha is accepted (Ho is rejected) then it can be concluded that the Problem Based Learning model with 3D thinking map affects the physics learning outcomes in high school.","[Bektiarso, S.; Dewi, D.

However, the technique can only rarely provide accurate estimates in vivo, as it requires that the light fluence at the voxels of interest is constant with wavelength. One way to extend the set of cases where accurate information related to sO(2) can be acquired with the technique is by taking the difference in sO(2) estimates between vessels. Assuming images are perfectly reconstructed, the intervascular difference in sO(2) estimates is accurate if the error in the estimates due to the wavelength dependence of the fluence is identical for both. An in silico study was performed to uncover what kinds of conditions may give rise to accurate sO(2) differences for a vessel pair. Basic criteria were formulated in simple tissue models consisting of a pair of vessels immersed in two-layer skin models. To assess whether these criteria might still be valid in more realistic imaging scenarios, the sO(2) difference was estimated for vessels in more complex tissue models.","[Bench, C.; Cox, B.] UCL, Dept Med Phys & Biomed Engn, London WC1E 6BT, England","Bench, C (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Med Phys & Biomed Engn, London WC1E 6BT, England.",ciaran.bench.17@ucl.ac.uk,,"Cox, Ben/0000-0001-7296-4093","BBSRC London Interdisciplinary Doctoral Programme, LIDo","The authors would like to thank Paul Beard and UCL's Photoacoustic Imaging Group for useful discussions.

FLS are currently primarily used for wind resource assessment purposes before the construction phase of an offshore wind farm. That is why a precise knowledge of the measurement accuracy or uncertainty of the FLS for different wind and wave conditions is very important. The lack of knowledge could be mitigated with a simulation tool for FLS of different types and for variable wind and wave conditions. Within this paper we present an approach for such a simulation framework for FLS and the process for validating this simulation environment using data from an offshore measurement campaign.

One noise reduction strategy uses a modified airfoil to split and spread the vorticity in two tip vortices. The present paper aims to provide the wake structure produced by such a rotor for wind turbine and helicopter regimes. We use a filamentary approach, such that vortices are assumed to roll-up quickly to form thin vortex filaments of finite but small size and compute the induced velocity using a cut-off method. The structure of the wake is analyzed in the near- and far-fields separately. It is found to have a dual nature and to be well-described by a twisted vortex pair locally aligned along with a larger helical structure. The linear stability of the far-wake with respect to long-wave displacements is also analyzed. Two kinds of instability modes are obtained associated with a pairing between successive turns of the large helical structure and a pairing between successive turns of the vortex pair.","[Castillo-Castellanos, A.; Le Dizes, S.] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRPHE, Cent Marseille, 49 Rue Frederic Joliot Curie,BP146, F-13384 Marseille, France; [Duran Venegas, E.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Escuela Politecn Super, Dept Bioingn & Ingn Aerosp, Avda Univ, Leganes 3028911, Spain","Castillo-Castellanos, A (corresponding author), Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRPHE, Cent Marseille, 49 Rue Frederic Joliot Curie,BP146, F-13384 Marseille, France.",andres-alonso.castillo-castellanos@univ-amu.fr,,"Le Dizes, Stephane/0000-0001-6540-0433; Duran Venegas, Eduardo/0000-0002-4212-3004",Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-17-CE06-0018]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [391677260],"This work is part of the French-German project TWIN-HELIX, supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (grant no.

In this paper, the practice of modeling this effect after linear superposition of single turbine inductions, calculated with three of the most recent analytic models, is compared to Large-Eddy-Simulations of idealized wind farms. We compare the models across two different farms, composed of 9 and 49 turbines, with two different heights of the atmospheric boundary layer, 300 and 500 m. The results show that the differences between the analytical models are negligible while they substantially differ from the LES results. The linear superposition of induction consistently underestimates the upstream velocity deficit with an error that increases as the wind farm size grows and the ABL height decreases. Also when calculating the power output at the turbines of the farm, the analytical models considered do not agree well with the LES. These comparisons reveal that the farm interactions with the atmospheric boundary layer may highly outclass the turbine induction in determining the extent of the global blockage effect. Therefore, we present a first dimensional approach to the problem based on LES, aimed at simplifying its characterization.","[Centurelli, G.; Schroeder, M.; Lukassen, L.

One major challenge deals with the implementation of high self-consumption (SC) schemes for the energy produced on site, essential to carry on a wider implementation of photovoltaic systems. The present paper addresses the effect of different sizing strategies on the SC levels of 3 systems installed on traditional and nZEB houses, with a peak power between 3.12 kWp and 5.98 kWp. The systems have been monitored recording the various energy flows involved. Different optimization strategies have been tested with the purpose of minimizing the interaction with the grid, according to SC and self-sufficiency (SS) indexes. The aim is to provide design guidelines for the correct sizing in a bottom-up approach. Results underlined the fundamental role of storage technologies. Approximately 6 Wp/m(2) assure an optimal energy employment without storage, with SS index below 35%: the integration of small storage, 3-7 kWh/kWp leads to SS and SC index above 60% and 88% respectively.","[Cillari, Giacomo; Fantozzi, Fabio; Franco, Alessandro] Univ Pisa, Dept Energy Syst Terr & Construct Engn, I-56126 Pisa, Italy","Cillari, G (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Energy Syst Terr & Construct Engn, I-56126 Pisa, Italy.",giacomo.cillari@phd.unipi.it,,"Fantozzi, Fabio/0000-0002-3213-1764",,,"Awan AB, 2020, ENERGIES, V13, DOI 10.3390/en1314363; Bodis K, 2019, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V114, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2019.10930; Denholm P, 2011, ENERG POLICY, V39, P1817, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2011.01.01; Franco A, 2020, BUILDINGS-BASEL, V10, DOI 10.3390/buildings1010017; GSE) GSE, 2019, STAT REP PHOT SYS; iEA, 2020, SOL PV TRACK 202; JRC) JRC, 2019, PV STATUS REPORT 20; Masson G., 2012, PHOTOVOLTAICS INT, P16; RSE, SUNR ATL 202; Victoria M, 2021, JOULE, V5, P1041, DOI 10.1016/j.joule.2021.03.00; Widen J, 2014, APPL ENERG, V126, P199, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.04.00",11,0,0,3,3,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12088,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012088,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100088,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.0022531749283080703,2.0516343220723375e-17,0.012235909441932244,0.05346504292973541,0.012235909441932244

To be able to anticipate how much the built environment actually influences our light exposure, and how much it may ultimately impact our health, well-being, and productivity, new computational tools are needed. In this paper, we present a first attempt at a simulation workflow that integrates a spectral simulation tool with a light-driven prediction model of alertness. The goal is to optimize the effects of light on building occupants, by informing the decision makers about the impact of different design choices. The workflow is applied to a case study to provide an example of what learnings can be expected from it.","[Clotilde, Pierson; Eugenia, Soto Magan Victoria; Marilyne, Andersen] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Integrated Performance Design LIPID, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Clotilde, Pierson; Marielle, Aarts] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Bldg Lighting Grp, Eindhoven, Netherlands","Clotilde, P (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Integrated Performance Design LIPID, Lausanne, Switzerland.;Clotilde, P (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Bldg Lighting Grp, Eindhoven, Netherlands.",clotilde.pierson@epfl.ch,"Pierson, Clotilde/U-4223-2019","Pierson, Clotilde/0000-0001-7847-6568",European Union [754462],This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 754462.,"Amundadottir ML, 2016, THESIS EPF; Berson DM, 2002, SCIENCE, V295, P1070, DOI 10.1126/science.106726; Brown T, 2020, ROUTL RES TEACHER ED, P; Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage, 2018, S026E CI; Diakite-Kortlever A, LIGHTING RES TECHNOL, V202; Gooley JJ, 2010, SCI TRANSL MED, V2, DOI 10.1126/scitranslmed.300074; Grant DA, 2017, BEHAV RES METHODS, V49, P1020, DOI 10.3758/s13428-016-0763-; Gul M, 2018, ENERGIES, V11, DOI 10.3390/en1111288; HODDES E, 1972, PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY, V9, P15; Inanici M., 2015, LARK SPECTRAL LIGHT; Jakubiec JA, 2021, SPECTRAL MAT DATABA; MONK TH, 1989, PSYCHIAT RES, V27, P89, DOI 10.1016/0165-1781(89)90013-; Pierson C, BUILD SIMUL-CHINA, V202; Rajaratnam S, 2013, MED J AUSTRALIA, V19; Rajaratnam SM, 2001, LANCET, V358, P999, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(01)06108-; Schlangen LJM, 2021, FRONT NEUROL, V12, DOI 10.3389/fneur.2021.62486; Solemma LLC Alertness CRC, 2018, ALFA AD LIGHT A; Soto Magan VE, 2021, THESIS EPF; St Hilaire MA, 2007, J PINEAL RES, V43, P294, DOI 10.1111/j.1600-079X.2007.00477.; Tekieh T, 2020, J PINEAL RES, V69, DOI 10.1111/jpi.1268",20,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12116,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012116,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100116,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-07-14,0.004096681687832855,3.365894093803287e-15,0.007361227530674544,0.058752737863142945,0.007361227530674544

To exclude the uncertainties related to the blade loads computation, the loads of a corresponding blade-resolving simulation are imposed. Three force projection functions are applied, which all radially scale with the local chord length: an isotropic Gauss force distribution, an anisotropic Gauss distribution with distinct projection widths in the chord and thickness directions, and a Gauss-Gumbel projection function which creates an airfoil-like force distribution in the chord direction. Comparisons with corresponding blade-resolving simulations and experimental results show a good agreement of the tip vortex core size, position and circulation. Comparison of the mid-wake instantaneous streamwise velocity with blade-resolving simulations shows a thinner vortex sheet and stronger effects of the trailed vortices in the actuator line simulation. Although the bound vortex shape scales with the projection function, no significant difference was observed in the resulting tip vortices and near-wake flow field between the three projection functions used. It is attributed to the similar projection width in the tip vortex region for all cases considered. With the chosen grid refinement in the tip vortex area and a smearing width that scales with the chord length, tip vortices that compare with high-resolution experiments and high-fidelity blade-resolving simulation could be generated with the actuator line approach.","[Cormier, Marion; Weihing, Pascal; Lutz, Thorsten] Univ Stuttgart, Fac Aerosp Engn & Geodesy, Inst Aerodynam & Gas Dynam, Pfaffenwaldring 21, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany","Cormier, M (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Fac Aerosp Engn & Geodesy, Inst Aerodynam & Gas Dynam, Pfaffenwaldring 21, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",cormier@iag.uni-stuttgart.de; lutz@iag.uni-stuttgart.de,,,,,"Boorsma K, 2016, WIND ENERGY, V201; Church field M J, 35 WIND EN ; Dag KO, 2020, WIND ENERGY, V23, P148, DOI 10.1002/we.241; Forsting ARM, 2020, J PHYS CONF SER, V1618, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1618/5/05200; Forsting ARM, 2019, WIND ENERGY SCI, V4, P369, DOI 10.5194/wes-4-369-201; Jha PK, 2014, J SOL ENERG-T ASME, V136, DOI 10.1115/1.402625; Kroll N, 2005, MEGAFLOW NUMERICAL ; Martinez-Tossas LA, 2017, WIND ENERGY, V20, P1083, DOI 10.1002/we.208; Martinez-Tossas LA, 2016, J PHYS CONF SER, V753, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/753/8/08201; Martinez-Tossas LA, 2015, WIND ENERGY, V18, P1047, DOI 10.1002/we.174; Meister K, 2011, DESCRIPTION VORTEX ; Meister K, 2009, DEV PROCESS CHAIN D; Schepers J.G., 2007, ECNE0704; Schollenberger M, 2018, S DGLR, P60; Schulz C, 2016, NOTES NUMER FLUID ME, V132, P871, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-27279-5_7; Shives M, 2013, WIND ENERGY, V16, P1183, DOI 10.1002/we.154; Sorensen JN, 2002, J FLUID ENG-T ASME, V124, P393, DOI 10.1115/1.147136; Troldborg N., 2009, THESIS TU DENMAR; Troldborg N, 2015, WIND ENERGY, V18, P1239, DOI 10.1002/we.175; Weihing P, 2021, THESIS U STUTTGAR; Weihing P, 2017, J PHYS CONF SER, V854, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/854/1/01204",21,0,0,4,5,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1934.0,,,,,,,,12013,10.1088/1742-6596/1934/1/012013,,10,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Mechanical; Mechanics; Physics, Fluids & Plasmas",Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Mechanics; Physics,BS3JN,WOS:000712011500013,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.0043015157722244984,5.41699240445694e-05,0.005502443210857494,0.11750264754019447,0.005471842474981922

The main issue of operational energy consumption before and after refurbishment should be calculated with reliable predictive models to support investment payback time evaluations. For that purpose, dynamic simulation can reduce the performance gap between simulated and actual performance, however, multiple issues are involved. In the EU Directives, the nZEB framework addresses the operational consumption, which traditionally was the main portion in the building life cycle. However, where nZEB is concerned, the running energy is strongly reduced and embedded energy and disposal assume a higher contribution to the energy life cycle cost. It is worthy to note that LC-ZEBs (Life Cycle Zero Energy Buildings) have been conceptualized more than 10 years ago and the LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) approach is now integrated into the most advanced CVEs (Calculation Virtual Environments) to enable a broader evaluation of building energy during the lifespan. The paper presents LCA scenarios for a housing case study located in Italy and Norway where energy saving is regulated and suitable solutions are strongly connected to materials and energy supply contexts.","[Costardi, Luigi] Univ Brescia, Dept Civil Environm Architectural Engn & Math, Via Branze 43, I-25123 Brescia, Italy; [Tagliabue, Lavinia Chiara] Univ Turin, Dept Comp Sci, Corso Svizzera 185, I-10149 Turin, Italy; [Hamdy, Mohamed] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Fac Engn, Byggtekn 2-236,Hogskoleringen 7A, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Dotelli, Giovanni] Politecn Milan, Dept Chem Mat & Chem Engn G Natta, Pzza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Tagliabue, LC (corresponding author), Univ Turin, Dept Comp Sci, Corso Svizzera 185, I-10149 Turin, Italy.",laviniachiara.tagliabue@unito.it,,"Tagliabue, Lavinia Chiara/0000-0002-3059-4204",,,"Asdrubali F, 2020, ENERGY, V191, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2019.11648; British Standards Institution, 2012, 159782011 BS E; Dalla Mora T, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V12, DOI 10.3390/su1217718; Drouilles J, 2019, ENERG EFFIC, V12, P1661, DOI 10.1007/s12053-019-09811-; European Parliament, 2018, OFFICIAL J EUROPEAN, V61, P7; Georges L, 2015, BUILD RES INF, V43, P82, DOI 10.1080/09613218.2015.95575; Gonzalez Caceres A., 2017, P 59 C SIMULATION M; Hernandez P, 2010, ENERG BUILDINGS, V42, P815, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2009.12.00; ISTAT, 15 POPULATION HOUSI; Moran P, 2017, ENERG BUILDINGS, V139, P590, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.01.02; Skaran A.

BEEP works with building industry, policy makers, and building owners to catalyse adoption of EETC building design and technologies. India wants to avoid or reduce the use of air conditioning by improving natural ventilation at night, which requires numerical simulations to compute the flow around the buildings. However, the simulations of fluid flows are time consuming and are not used at the beginning of a project when the locations of the buildings are set. To improve the situation, a freely distributable environment based on the OpenFOAM toolbox has been developed providing two levels of resolution: an approximate level computing the flow in few minutes and a RANS level of simulation. The user inputs are limited to the geometry and the velocity direction and magnitude. The mesh and the numerical set up are automated. The accuracy of the two levels of resolution have been checked by computing test cases from the CEDVAL database.","[Decaix, J.] HES SO Valais Wallis, Haute Ecole Ingn, Inst Energie & Environm, Rawil 47, CH-1950 Sion, Switzerland; [Jaboyedoff, P.] Effinart, Chemin Prefleuri 6, CH-1006 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Duthe, G.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [El Sergany, E.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Aiulfi, L.] ESRI, Zurich, Switzerland","Decaix, J (corresponding author), HES SO Valais Wallis, Haute Ecole Ingn, Inst Energie & Environm, Rawil 47, CH-1950 Sion, Switzerland.",jean.decaix@hevs.ch,,"Duthe, Gregory/0000-0002-0895-6766; , Jean/0000-0003-3944-471X",Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC),The BEEP project team thanks the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) for its continuous support during the development of this CFD software.

In this paper, we present results of lidar detection and characterization of aerosol layers present in the troposphere over the city of Sofia. The measurements were performed at the wavelengths of 1064 nm and 532 nm by using the Nd:YAG-laser based lidar of Sofia lidar station, part of the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET) and the Aerosol, Clouds and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure (ACTRIS). Time-averaged vertical profiles of the aerosol backscatter coefficient and the backscatter-related Angstrom exponent were retrieved and analyzed. Color-coded height-time diagrams of the vertical mass distribution in the observed layers and its temporal dynamics were also obtained.

However, since weeks long experiments are needed to assess the performance of a building controller, people still have to rely on accurate simulation environments to train and tune DRL agents in tractable amounts of time before deploying them, shifting the burden back to the original issue of designing complex models. In this work, we show that it is possible to learn control policies on simple black-box linear room temperature models, thereby alleviating the heavy engineering usually required to build accurate surrogates. We develop a black-box pipeline, where historical data is taken as input to produce room temperature control policies. The trained DRL agents are capable of beating industrial rule-based controllers both in terms of energy consumption and comfort satisfaction, using novel penalties to introduce expert knowledge, i.e. to incentivize agents to follow expected behaviors, in the reward function. Moreover, one of the best agents was deployed on a real building for one week and was able to save energy while maintaining adequate comfort levels, indicating that low-complexity models might be enough to learn control policies that perform well on real buildings.","[Di Natale, L.; Svetozarevic, B.; Heer, P.] Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol Empa, Urban Energy Syst Lab, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Di Natale, L.; Jones, C.

The implementation of STEM increases the productivity of the learning process in responding to the challenges of the industrial revolution 4.0. Because it is relatively new in Indonesia, the application of the STEM approach in learning has certain difficulties for teachers. This study aims to determine the difficulties faced by Indonesian mathematics and science teachers in implementing STEM in recent five years. Based on seven main articles compared in this study, the difficulties faced by teachers in implementing STEM or STEAM are varied depending on its main focus (mathematics or science). The most common obstacle faced by mathematics teachers are finding real-life contexts of abstract topic in mathematics. While, the main difficulty experienced by science teachers are insufficient comprehension toward STEM and the limitation of time. Moreover, both mathematics and science teachers shared common difficulties as follows: low understanding about STEM, the lack of facilities and limited time provided in learning schedule.

In general, it is defined as the condition of thermal, visual, acoustic and air quality comfort and depends on multiple factors. In the case of school buildings, the relevance of IEQ is related to its effects on the wellbeing, health and performance of the students and teachers. This research summarizes previous studies of IEQ from a multivariable perspective to prove that this research area needs to be further developed. Previous results show that an integrated analysis of IEQ parameters could better understand the IEQ perception of their occupants. Research on IEQ in schools generally refers to one or two aspects of the four. Even the most recent research deals with these topics separately, without using a systemic approach. The reductionism generated by isolating parameters allows us to study a parameter in detail but does not evaluate the environmental quality of the space. This is why new metrics are necessary to describe, assess and compare IEQ in educational spaces under a systemic approach.","[Diaz, Muriel; Attia, Shady] Univ Liege, Fac Appl Sci, Dept UEE, Sustainable Bldg Design SBD Lab, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Diaz, Muriel; Beatriz Piderit, Maria] Univ Bio Bio, Fac Architecture Construct & Design, Dept Architectural Design & Theory, Concepcion, Chile","Diaz, M (corresponding author), Univ Liege, Fac Appl Sci, Dept UEE, Sustainable Bldg Design SBD Lab, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.;Diaz, M (corresponding author), Univ Bio Bio, Fac Architecture Construct & Design, Dept Architectural Design & Theory, Concepcion, Chile.",madiaz@uliege.be,"Attia, Shady/M-4942-2013; Diaz, Muriel/Q-2893-2017","Attia, Shady/0000-0002-9477-5098; Diaz, Muriel/0000-0002-9606-162X",Wallonie Brussel International fund through project HERES: Healthy and Resilient schools 2019-2021; University of the Bio-Bio [194503 GI/C],"We would like to acknowledge the Sustainable Buildings Design Lab at University Liege for the valuable support during the conceptualization and writing of this paper.

The primary control strategy investigated involves de-rating of individual turbines in the wind farm. The optimal de-rating level of each individual turbine is determined by using accurate and computationally efficient surrogate models, mapping the dependency between the choice of de-rating strategy for a given turbine and the load and power outputs of downwind turbines. A case study based on the Lillgrund offshore wind farm shows that for specific wind directions with strong wake interactions, it may be possible to achieve a net gain in power output in the order of 5% at specific mean wind speeds. Alternatively, maintaining nominal power output but optimizing the load distribution could lead to substantial fatigue load reductions.","[Dimitrov, Nikolay; Natarajan, Anand] DTU Wind Energy, Roskilde, Denmark","Dimitrov, N (corresponding author), DTU Wind Energy, Roskilde, Denmark.",nkdi@dtu.dk,"Dimitrov, Nikolay/B-7278-2015; Natarajan, Anand/C-5517-2011","Dimitrov, Nikolay/0000-0003-1325-4512; Natarajan, Anand/0000-0001-6850-0798",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [727680],This work is part of the TotalControl project funded by European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 727680.

Three wind speed scenarios are considered: below, at, and above rated operation. The inflow is generated with the Mann model and the wake and loads are simulated with FAST.Farm. As the upstream rotor tilt goes from 0 degrees to 6 degrees, we find that the mean wake is displaced upward by more than 0.2 rotor diameters (D) by a downstream distance of 7 D. The vertical velocities increase by up to 35 cm/s in the center of the wake. As a result, the downstream rotor is partially waked and experiences a rotated velocity vector. With a higher upstream rotor tilt, the velocities and moments on the downstream turbine increase their mean axial value and their lateral and vertical standard deviation. These changes affect the blade and tower loading and the floater motion primarily in the out-of-plane direction: the damage-equivalent loads for the tower pitch moment and blade-root moment increase by up to 10% because of higher variability at the first mode for the tower and at one blade passing frequency for the blade root. Lesser effects are observed for the roll moments and for floater sway and heave. When the joint effect of rotor tilt and platform motion is considered, the load response on the downstream system is amplified primarily for tower pitch and blade out-of-plane moment.","[Doubrawa, P.; Sirnivas, S.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab NREL, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Godvik, M.] Equinor, Sandsliveien 90, Bergen, Norway","Doubrawa, P (corresponding author), Natl Renewable Energy Lab NREL, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",paula.doubrawa@nrel.gov,,,National Renewable Energy Laboratory; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC36-08GO28308]; U.S. Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Wind Energy Technologies Office,"This work was authored [in part] by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, operated by Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC, for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

The extinction coefficient profiles of the aerosol ensembles along the lidar line of sight (LOS) are measured at the lidar wavelengths of 510.6 nm (CuBr-vapor laser source) and 1064 nm and 532 nm (Nd:YAG laser source). The particulate mass concentration is determined using data obtained concurrently by air-quality measuring sensors close to the LOS. Thus, the results obtained of the aerosol mass concentration-to-extinction calibration constant of the lidar concern mainly the sites around the nearest stations. To help the interpretation of the results, the accompanying weather conditions are also described. The experiments are conducted in the spring and the summer and the results obtained reflect the ecological peculiarities of the corresponding city regions of interest. The values found of the calibration constant are consistent with those obtained earlier in the same seasons.","[Dreischuh, T.; Kolarov, G.; Grigorov, I; Peshev, Z.; Deleva, A.; Vulkova, L.; Gurdev, L.; Stoyanov, D.] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Acad E Djakov Inst Elect, 72 Tsarigradsko Chaussee, Sofia 1784, Bulgaria","Dreischuh, T (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Acad E Djakov Inst Elect, 72 Tsarigradsko Chaussee, Sofia 1784, Bulgaria.",tanjad@ie.bas.bg,,"Dreischuh, Tanja/0000-0003-3730-0405",Ministry of Education and Science of Bulgaria [D 01-363/17.12.2020]; Bulgarian National Science Fund [KP-06-N28/10/2018],"This work was carried out in the framework of the National Science Program Environmental Protection and Reduction of Risks of Adverse Events and Natural Disasters, approved by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers no 577/17.08.2018 and supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of Bulgaria (Agreement no D 01-363/17.12.2020).

A design is thereby evaluated through its reliability by taking uncertainties into account. The influence of uncertainties emerging specifically within the fatigue limit state can be essential on a structure's reliability. For that reason, this study investigates two different sources for uncertainties within probabilistic fatigue design. The influence of a reduced approach, where the random behavior of a structural failure is only represented through an uncertain critical Miner sum, is compared to an approach, where also the S-N curve is subjected to uncertainties. For this, an offshore wind turbine with monopile support structure is investigated. The reliability analysis is performed through crude Monte Carlo simulations which utilize a Gaussian Process regression model in order to determine the wind turbine's structural response. The results show that both sources of uncertainties, the critical Miner sum and the S-N curve, contribute differently to the overall reliability. Uncertainties of the critical Miner sum have a rather small influence, whereas the implementation of an uncertain S-N curve leads to a noticeable increase of the reliability.","[Drexler, Sebastian; Muskulus, Michael] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Trondheim, Norway","Drexler, S (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Trondheim, Norway.",sebastian.drexler@ntnu.no,,,,,"[Anonymous], DNV GL 2019 O ff shore Standard DNVGL-OS-C101-Design of O ff shore Steel Structures, General-LRFD Metho; [Anonymous], DNV GL 2019 Energy Transition Outlook 2019-Power Supply and Us; [Anonymous], 50100201612 DI; Bates S., 2004, P 45 AIAA ASME ASC; DNV G, 2016, DNVGLST012; DNV GL., 2016, RECOMMENDED PRACTIC; Fairbrother J., 2019, ARXIV181209064, V181; Fischer T., 2010, UPWIND DESIGN BASI; Gelman A., 2013, BAYESIAN DATA ANAL, DOI DOI 10.1201/B1601; Hu C., 2019, ENG DESIGN UNCERTAI; International Electrotechnical Commision, 2019, 61400312019 IE; Jason Jonkman, 2009, DEFINITION 5 MW REFE, DOI DOI 10.2172/94742; Joint Commitee On Structural Safety J, 2011, PROB MOD COD PART ; Maljaars J, 2018, P 28 INT OC POL ENG, P26; Masendolf R, 2018, MATER TEST, V60, P961, DOI 10.3139/120.11123; Matsumoto M., 1998, ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation, V8, P3, DOI 10.1145/272991.27299; Melchers RE, 2018, STRUCTURAL RELIABIL; Menz M., 2020, ARXIV201115001, V201; MINER MA, 1945, J APPL MECH-T ASME, V12, pA15; Murphy KP, 2012, MACHINE LEARNING: A PROBABILISTIC PERSPECTIVE, P2; Rasmussen CE, 2005, ADAPT COMPUT MACH LE, P; Roberts S, 2013, PHILOS T R SOC A, V371, DOI 10.1098/rsta.2011.055; RYCHLIK I, 1987, INT J FATIGUE, V9, P119, DOI 10.1016/0142-1123(87)90054-; Sorensen JD, 2010, ENERGIES, V3, P241, DOI 10.3390/en302024; Stieng LES, 2020, WIND ENERGY SCI, V5, P171, DOI 10.5194/wes-5-171-202; Stieng LES, 2018, WIND ENERGY SCI, V3, P805, DOI 10.5194/wes-3-805-201; Thoft-Christensen P., 1986, APPL STRUCTURAL SYS; Vorpahl F, 2014, WIND ENERGY, V17, P519, DOI 10.1002/we.158; Zio E., 2013, MONTE CARLO SIMULAT",29,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2018.0,,,,,,,,12014,10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/012014,,12,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Mechanical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BS3LW,WOS:000713005900014,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-07-14,0.00594018844735764,3.4317554279455304e-05,0.01913618053048125,0.11800251377743401,0.01714877444984319

Depending on the specified design criteria in comparison with the 'real' conditions on site lifetime may fall below or pass over the design lifetime targets. After installation and during operation WT continuously suffer from incremental damage due to loads, fatigue and the continuous exposure to the physical environment and operating conditions. The initially inherent wear reserve of the WT or its components permanently decreases until it finally reaches predefined safety margins or the occurrence of premature component failure. The objective of the work is to identify quantifiable wear-out metrics and to deduce information on lifetime issues in order to optimise WT operation. The method divides into a simplified approach explaining the general concept and its implementation and adaption from design to in-situ conditions. Furthermore, the methodology is transferred to a component-specific level, namely generator windings, in order to evaluate the general suitability for non-mechanical load exposures. Finally, economic issues including an economic optimisation strategy considering previously calculated wear-out figures complete the work.","[Durstewitz, M.; Rehwald, F.; Wick, W.] Fraunhofer Inst Energy Econ & Energy Syst Technol, Energy Informat & Informat Syst, D-34119 Kassel, Germany","Rehwald, F (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Inst Energy Econ & Energy Syst Technol, Energy Informat & Informat Syst, D-34119 Kassel, Germany.",florian.rehwald@iee.fraunhofer.de,,"Rehwald, Florian/0000-0003-3869-2113",German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs Affairs and Energy through the project Korva Cost-and yield-optimized control/operational management of WTGs with variable plant operating time and variable electricity market prices [03EE500A],The research work of Fraunhofer IEE for this paper was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs Affairs and Energy through the project Korva Cost-and yield-optimized control/operational management of WTGs with variable plant operating time and variable electricity market prices (grant no. 03EE500A).,"[Anonymous], 2016, DNVGLSE044; Arens T, 2018, MATHEMATIK, V4t; Canet Tarres H, SYSTEMS ENG WIND EN; DIN Deutsches Institut fur Normung e V, 31051201209 DI; Fraunhofer-Institut f ur, EN E; IEC International Electrotechnical Commission, 2016, 614001ED4 IE; Kesenheimer J, 2003, GRUNDLAGENFORSCHUN; Lutz MA, 2020, WIND ENERGY, V23, P77, DOI 10.1002/we.241; Nath C, ZERTIFIZIERUNG WIND; Nemeth-Csoka M., 2018, THERMISCHES MANAGEM; Schiffer HW, 2019, ENERGIEMARKT DEUTSC; Sha fiee M, 2019, RELIAB ENG SYST SAFE, V19; Singh G, 2021, WIND ENG, V45, P491, DOI 10.1177/0309524X2091099; Welte TM, 2014, ADV MANUF, V2, P79, DOI 10.1007/s40436-014-0064-; Wiggert M M, 2018, OFFSHORE TIMES OFFS; Zapf M., 2017, STROMSPEICHER POWE; Ziegler L, 2018, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V82, P1261, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2017.09.10",17,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2018.0,,,,,,,,12015,10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/012015,,15,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Mechanical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BS3LW,WOS:000713005900015,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-07-14,0.003482179434657927,0.00020442457555975,0.006544618956985346,0.08502264019505398,0.006544618956985346

This study aims to determine the self-perceptions and skills of prospective physics teachers in the Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge Knowledge (TPACK) framework to support distance learning. This research is a quantitative research. Self-Perceptions were screened using a questionnaire, 128 research subjects were Physics education students in Samarinda, Indonesia. Then, the skills of prospective physics teachers in the TPACK framework to support distance learning were sought through video observations with 30 research subjects from 128 previous students. Based on data analysis, self-perceptions of prospective physics teachers within the TPACK framework in sufficient category. There is a significant difference between the self-perception of prospective physics teachers who have taken computer training and have never taken computer training. The skills of prospective physics teachers in the TPACK framework are also in the sufficient category. Based on this, educational institutions need to increase learning and training for prospective physics teachers to integrate technology in learning so that their TPACK skills can be improved.","[Efwinda, S.] Mulawarman Univ, Phys Educ, Jl Muara Pahu Kampus Gunung Kelua, Samarinda 75123, Indonesia; [Mannan, M.

Model predictive control (MPC) can reduce their energy consumption and improve thermal comfort. However, designing the required models can be time consuming. Splitting the control problem into smaller subproblems could make the modeling process more modular and therefore cheaper. A hierarchical MPC structure is proposed in this work, where the building model is divided into a lower layer consisting of the producer side and an upper layer consisting of the consumers. Linear and non-linear model equations as well as a cost-based and a control quality-based cost function for a building energy system are developed. In a simulation, the nonlinear controller outperforms the linear controller in both constraint satisfaction and energy costs.","[Eser, Steffen; Stoffel, Phillip; Kumpel, Alexander; Muller, Dirk] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Aachen, Germany","Eser, S (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Aachen, Germany.",steffen.eser@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,,,BMWi (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy) [03ET1495],"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the BMWi (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy), promotional references 03ET1495.","Andersson JAE, 2019, MATH PROGRAM COMPUT, V11, P1, DOI 10.1007/s12532-018-0139-; Drgona J, 2020, ANNU REV CONTROL, V50, P190, DOI 10.1016/j.arcontrol.2020.09.00; Herrera E, 2015, ENERG BUILDINGS, V104, P47, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.06.07; M~uller D, BAUSI; Oldewurtel F, 2012, ENERG BUILDINGS, V45, P15, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.09.02; Rawlings JB, COMPUTERS CHEM EN; Scattolini R, 2009, J PROCESS CONTR, V19, P723, DOI 10.1016/j.jprocont.2009.02.00; Wachter A, 2006, MATH PROGRAM, V106, P25, DOI 10.1007/s10107-004-0559-",8,0,0,1,2,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12032,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012032,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100032,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.0016386726751331422,6.063605749540427e-09,0.0024605150000481676,0.08745969186671444,0.0024596864427311642

It is shown that the relative double-scattering component of the LIDAR return may be approximately considered as a sum of the independent relative contributions of each of the atmospheric components. Then, using appropriate models, the contribution of each component of interest is evaluated as a function of the altitude, taking into account the scattering properties of the medium under consideration, the angular divergence and the wavelength of the sensing laser beam, and the angle of view of the receiving optical system. The results obtained outline the cases when either the double scattering is negligible or corrections are necessary for the multiple scattering effects.","[Evgenieva, Ts; Gurdev, L.] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Elect, 72 Tsarigradsko Chaussee Blvd, Sofia 1784, Bulgaria; [Grigorov, V] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Solid State Phys, 72 Tsarigradsko Chaussee Blvd, Sofia 1784, Bulgaria; [Anguelov, V] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Nucl Res & Nucl Energy, 72 Tsarigradsko Chaussee Blvd, Sofia 1784, Bulgaria","Evgenieva, T (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Elect, 72 Tsarigradsko Chaussee Blvd, Sofia 1784, Bulgaria.",tsevgenieva@ie.bas.bg,,,Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science; Bulgarian National Science Fund [KP-06-N28/10/2018]; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program under the ACTRIS IMP project [871115],"This research has been supported partly by the Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science (support for ACTRIS BG, part of the Bulgarian National Roadmap for Research Infrastructure), the Bulgarian National Science Fund (Grant No. KP-06-N28/10/2018) and the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program under the ACTRIS IMP project (Grant No. 871115).","Bissonnette LR, 1996, APPL OPTICS, V35, P6449, DOI 10.1364/AO.35.00644; Eloranta EW, 1998, APPL OPTICS, V37, P2464, DOI 10.1364/AO.37.00246; Evgenieva TT, 2018, J PHYS CONF SER, V992, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/992/1/01202; Kovalev V.A., 2004, ELASTIC LIDAR THEOR; Measures R.M., 1984, LASER REMOTE SENSIN; Orikasa N, 2006, J ATMOS SCI, V63, P2156, DOI 10.1175/JAS3736.; SAMOKHVALOV IV, 1979, OPT LETT, V4, P12, DOI 10.1364/OL.4.00001; Wandinger U, 1998, APPL OPTICS, V37, P417, DOI 10.1364/AO.37.00041; Weitkamp p., 2005, LIDAR RANGE RESOLVE; Whiteman DN, 2001, J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS, V106, P5211, DOI 10.1029/2000JD90062",11,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1859.0,,,,,,,,12029,10.1088/1742-6596/1859/1/012029,,6,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Quantum Science & Technology; Optics; Physics, Applied",Engineering; Physics; Optics,BS2DU,WOS:000700377600029,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.0020483408439164277,7.628691145612425e-07,0.0034449979147294298,0.09452081316553727,0.003411008577963902

This survey consists of five statements as the media for teacher to doing self-assessment of their TPK and five question about their readiness in organizing online learning. From the survey results it appears that the teacher's TPK level obtained from self-assessment is not in accordance with the teacher's statement related to their readiness in implementing online learning. There are 18.75% of teachers whose self-assessment results are at a low level, but more than 64% of teachers have not mastered various applications to facilitate online learning. Furthermore, the forms of effort made by teachers in perfecting the online learning process are also very limited, as evidenced by the existence of 80% of teachers who interpret online learning by sharing material online without adequate discussion facilities.","[Fakhrunisa, F.] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Program Studi Pendidikan Matemat, Jl Dr Setiabudhi 229, Bandung 40154, Indonesia","Fakhrunisa, F (corresponding author), Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Program Studi Pendidikan Matemat, Jl Dr Setiabudhi 229, Bandung 40154, Indonesia.",fauziahfakhrunisa@upi.edu,,,,,"Afolabi AA, 2015, PROCD SOC BEHV, V176, P610, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.01.51; Akyuz D, 2018, COMPUT EDUC, V125, P212, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2018.06.01; Alrwaished N, 2017, EURASIA J MATH SCI T, V13, P6113, DOI 10.12973/eurasia.2017.01053; Aqib MA, 2018, J PHYS CONF SER, V947, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/947/1/01206; Dyer Thomas, 2015, J INSTR RES, V4, P126, DOI DOI 10.9743/JIR.2015.1; Figg C, 2009, UNPACKING TPACK TP; Ghavifekr S, 2010, OIDA INT J SUITABLE, V01, P7; Harris J, 2009, J RES TECHNOL EDUC, V41, P393, DOI 10.1080/15391523.2009.1078253; Hung ML, 2016, COMPUT EDUC, V94, P120, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2015.11.01; Karal H., 2015, CONT ED TECHNOLOGY, V6, P319, DOI [10.30935/cedtech/6157, DOI 10.30935/CEDTECH/6157; Koo AC, 2008, EDUC TECHNOL SOC, V11, P26; Malubay J, 2018, EUR J ED STUD, V4, P19; Margerum-Leys J., 2002, Journal of Educational Computing Research, V26, P427, DOI 10.1092/KQCF-BLX2-TCHV-AGA; Mishra P, 2006, TEACH COLL REC, V108, P1017, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9620.2006.00684.; NCTM (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics), 2000, PRINCIPLES STANDARD; Niess ML, 2005, TEACH TEACH EDUC, V21, P509, DOI 10.1016/j.tate.2005.03.00; Ozudogru M, 2019, CONT ED TECHNOL, V10, P; Schmidt DA, 2009, J RES TECHNOL EDUC, V42, P123, DOI 10.1080/15391523.2009.1078254; Soares F, 2016, INTED PROC, P263",19,0,0,1,4,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1806.0,,,,,,,,12074,10.1088/1742-6596/1806/1/012074,,6,"Education, Scientific Disciplines",Education & Educational Research,BR6UL,WOS:000664182600074,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.002910093429315362,1.0521237060641871e-13,0.010686297033746874,0.08851081136040127,0.010686297033746874

Manufacturers have adopted simpler blade designs having a linear chord distribution at the inboard regions. While this has a small effect on the efficiency loss of wind turbines with fixed foundations, the effect of such blade linearization on the aerodynamic performance of floating wind turbines has not been sufficiently dealt with in open literature. This study applies a free-wake vortex model to compare the power and thrust characteristics of floating wind turbines having linearized blades with those having optimised blades. Three- and two-bladed rotors are assumed for different platform surge motions that are representative of different metocean conditions. The study showed that the loss in efficiency through blade linearization is small and similar in magnitude to that encountered in fixed rotors.","[Fenech, E.; Sant, T.] Univ Malta, Dept Mech Engn, Msida 2080, Msd, Malta","Sant, T (corresponding author), Univ Malta, Dept Mech Engn, Msida 2080, Msd, Malta.",tonio.sant@um.edu.mt,,,,,"Betz A, 1920, Z GESAMTE TURBINENWE, V2; Burton T., 2001, WIND ENERG; Chen ZW, 2021, RENEW ENERG, V163, P1849, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2020.10.09; de Vaal JB, 2014, WIND ENERGY, V17, P105, DOI 10.1002/we.156; Farrugia R, 2014, RENEW ENERG, V70, P24, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2013.12.04; Glauert H., 1935, AERODYNAMIC THEORY, VIV, P169, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-91487-4_; Goldstein S, 1929, P R SOC LOND A-CONTA, V123, P440, DOI 10.1098/rspa.1929.007; Joukowsky N., 1918, T A RASCHETNOISPYTAT, V3, P; Manwell JF, 2009, THEORY DESIGN APP; Okulov VL, 2010, J FLUID MECH, V649, P497, DOI 10.1017/S002211201000050; Ramasamy M, 2005, 6 ANN FOR AM HEL SO; Sant T, 2019, 2 ASME INT OFFSH WI; Sebastian T, 2012, RENEW ENERG, V46, P269, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2012.03.03; van Kuik GAM, 2007, WIND ENERGY, V10, P289, DOI 10.1002/we.21; Wen BR, 2018, WIND ENERGY, V21, P1076, DOI 10.1002/we.221",15,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2018.0,,,,,,,,12016,10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/012016,,11,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Mechanical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BS3LW,WOS:000713005900016,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.0030725112658746417,7.899551306797527e-05,0.0051501763005272665,0.11390042461854323,0.004967665038936545

These insulating glass units (IGU) include a thin silver coating acting as an infrared mirror which reduces the thermal losses that occur through radiation, but at the same time reflects the microwaves for mobile communication. To address this drawback, a specific laser treatment is performed on the silver coating which strongly improves the transmission of microwaves through the window. In this study, the attenuation of microwaves signal was analyzed inside the SolAce unit in the NEST research building at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) in Dubendorf. Two configurations (with and without laser-treated glazing) were carried out by interchanging two hinged windows. The results showed a significant improvement in signal strength in the configuration with laser-treated IGUs. A transmission loss contour plot of the SolAce unit showed a highly directional propagation of the wave which suggests that more than two windows should be treated to achieve better mobile communication in the entire unit. The novel patterned coating is thus especially valuable in the building sector to increase the microwave signal for mobile communication. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation and testing of laser-treated coating for energy-eficient glazing in the building sector.","[Fleury, Jeremy; Burnier, Luc; Delaporte, Heloise; Schuler, Andreas] EPFL Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab LESO PB, Nanotechnol Solar Energy Convers Grp, Lausanne, Switzerland","Fleury, J (corresponding author), EPFL Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab LESO PB, Nanotechnol Solar Energy Convers Grp, Lausanne, Switzerland.",jeremy.fleury@epfl.ch,,"Fleury, Jeremy/0000-0002-2684-2770",Federal Office of Transport (FOT); Federal Office of Energy (SFOE); Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research on Future Energy Efficient Buildings & Districts (SCCER FEEBD),"The authors would like to express their very great appreciation to Prof. Jean-Louis Scartezzini, Pietro Florio and Ali Motamed at EPFL, as well as Peter Richner, Enrico Marchesi and Bjorn Niesen at EMPA for the constructive suggestions during the planning and organization of the measurement campaign at the NEST in Dubendorf; Carine Genoud at Swisscom for providing the measurement equipment for this research work; Bernard Cuttat, Luc Houlmann and Nicolas Noirjean at AGC, as well as Jacques Tschopp at tz menuiserie SA for the coordination and production of the laser-treated windows.

The empirical QTFs are determined from cross bi-spectral analysis of model test data obtained in an ocean basin. Validation of the identified QTF is provided by comparing low frequency motions reconstructed from the empirical QTF with measurements. The numerical QTFs are calculated by a panel code that solves the wave-structure potential flow problem up to the second order. Systematic comparisons between numerical and empirical QTFs allows identification of tendencies of empirical QTFs and limitations of the second order potential flow predictions. The study is limited to hydrodynamic loads from waves only, i.e. without current. For small seastates, the results indicate that the second order potential flow predictions of the surge QTFs agree quite well with the wave drift coefficients identified empirically from the model test data. For moderate and high seastates, second order predictions underestimate the surge wave drift coefficients for all compared diagonals of the QTFs. The discrepancies between predictions and empirical coefficients are not small, especially at the lower frequency range (below around 0.10 Hz) where the potential flow wave drift forces tend to zero.","[Fonseca, Nuno; Thys, Maxime; Berthelsen, Petter Andreas] SINTEF Ocean, Marintekn Senter, Tyholt Otto Nielsens Vei 10, N-7052 Trondheim, Norway","Fonseca, N (corresponding author), SINTEF Ocean, Marintekn Senter, Tyholt Otto Nielsens Vei 10, N-7052 Trondheim, Norway.",nuno.fonseca@sintef.no,,"Fonseca, Nuno/0000-0002-2040-7444",Research Council of Norway through the ENERGIX programme [294573]; Equinor; MacGregor; Inocean; APL Norway; RWE Renewables,"The research leading to these results has received funding from the Research Council of Norway through the ENERGIX programme (grant 294573) and industry partners Equinor, MacGregor, Inocean, APL Norway and RWE Renewables.","Aksnes V., 2015, 25 INT OC POL ENG ; Berthelsen PA, 2016, PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 35TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON OCEAN, OFFSHORE AND ARCTIC ENGINEERING , 2016, VOL ; Berthelsen PA, 2009, OMAE 2009, VOL 1, P46; Bureau Veritas, 2019, HYDROSTAR EXPERTS U; Chen XB, 2007, J ENG MATH, V59, P61, DOI 10.1007/s10665-006-9074-; Dev A.K., 1994, P 7 INT C BEH OFFSH, V2, P85; DEV AK, 1995, INT OFFSHORE POLAR E, P53; Fonseca N., 2020, P ASME 2020 39 INT ; Fonseca N., 2017, P OFFSH TECHN C 1 4, DOI 10.4043/27803-M; Fonseca N, 2021, J OFFSHORE MECH ARCT, V143, DOI 10.1115/1.404754; Fonseca N, 2018, PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 37TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON OCEAN, OFFSHORE AND ARCTIC ENGINEERING, 2018, VOL ; Fonseca N, 2017, PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 36TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON OCEAN, OFFSHORE AND ARCTIC ENGINEERING, 2017, VOL ; Kvittem MI, 2018, P ASME INT C OCEA; Newman J.N, 1974, P INT S DYNAMICS MAR, P18; Ommani B, 2017, PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 36TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON OCEAN, OFFSHORE AND ARCTIC ENGINEERING, 2017, VOL ; Robertson AN, 2020, J PHYS CONF SER, V1618, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1618/3/03203; Robertson AN, 2017, ENRGY PROCED, V137, P38, DOI 10.1016/j.egypro.2017.10.33; Simos AN, 2018, RENEW ENERG, V116, P133, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2017.09.05; Stansberg C.T., 1997, INT C NONL ASP PHY; Stansberg CT, 2001, INT OFFSHORE POLAR E, P; Thys M., 2021, P INT C OFFSH MECH ",21,0,0,0,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2018.0,,,,,,,,12017,10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/012017,,11,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Mechanical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BS3LW,WOS:000713005900017,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-07-14,0.0043015157722244984,4.482734098627355e-07,0.007838646550562914,0.09737902421510353,0.007808703188750304

Deep minima in the tumor fluorescence signals were observed in the region 540 - 575 nm related to re-absorption of hemoglobin. Such high haemoglobin content was also found as an indication of the tumor's vascularization and it was clearly pronounced in all dysplastic and tumor sites investigated ex vivo. A photosensitizer from the family of porphyrins was applied as an exogenous fluorescent marker, namely, delta-aminolevulinic acid/protoporphyrin IX (5-ALA/PpIX). The 5-ALA was administered per os six hours before endoscopic observation and spectral measurements at a dose of 20 mg/ kg. A high-power light-emitting diode at 405 nm was used as an excitation source (LED-405, 25 mW, CW, Polironik Ltd., Russia). A fiber was introduced through an endoscopic instrumental channel in order to retrieve information about the fluorescence to a USB4000 micro-spectrometer (OceanOptics Inc., Dunedin, USA). The fluorescence detected from in vivo tumor sites has very complex spectral origins. It consists of autofluorescence, fluorescence from exogenous fluorophores and re-absorption from the chromophores accumulated in the investigated tissue. However, the fluorescence of 5-ALA/PpIX was clearly pronounced in the 630 - 710 nm region, having a significant contrast with the surrounding normal mucosa pale fluorescence in the blue-green spectral region. The precancerous mucosa also revealed a red light signal, but with lower intensity levels than the carcinoma lesions observed in situ. False-positive signals were recognized in case of inflammations in the colon and rectum areas, where 5-ALA/PpIX was accumulated as well.","[Genova, Ts; Kolev, B.; Angelov, I; Avramov, L.; Borisova, E.] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Elect, 72 Tsarigradsko Chaussee Blvd, Sofia 1784, Bulgaria; [Valkov, H.; Vladimirov, B.] Tsaritsa Yoanna ISUL Univ Hosp, 8 Byalo More Str, Sofia 1527, Bulgaria; [Angelov, I] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Ctr Phytochem, Inst Organ Chem, 9 Acad G Bonchev Str, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria; [Borisova, E.] Saratov NG Chernyshevskii State Univ, Biol Dept, 83 Astrakhanskaya Str, Saratov 410012, Russia","Genova, T (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Elect, 72 Tsarigradsko Chaussee Blvd, Sofia 1784, Bulgaria.",ts.genova@gmail.com,"Genova, Tsanislava/L-3876-2016",,"National Science Fund of the Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science [KP06-N28/11/2018]; Russian Science Foundation [18-15-00139, KP06-N38/13/2019]","The endogenous fluorescence measurements were supported by the National Science Fund of the Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science under grant #KP06-N28/11/2018.

New metrics have been developed to quantify the NIF effects of light. In order to incorporate these in lighting design practice, simulation tools are required that are able to process information about the spectral distribution of light sources and materials. However, most of the tools currently used for daylight and electric light simulations simplify the spectrum into RGB (Red, Green, Blue) colour values. This paper presents an overview of the currently used programs for simulating the NIF effects of light in building design and discusses the possibility of using existing spectral rendering software as an alternative. A review of literature shows that mostly Radiance or Radiance-based programs have been used so far, but new user-friendly tools could employ existing spectral rendering tools. As the NIF effects of light gain greater importance in lighting design, new simulation workflows are needed. This paper aims to support the development of future workflows by presenting the current state-of-the-art.","[Gkaintatzi-Masouti, M.; van Duijnhoven, J.; Aarts, M. P.

To carry out this study a dynamic energy simulation was performed, using the typical meteorological year (IWEC) provided by ASHRAE. The model was used to understand the effects of simple changes in the envelope configuration and the associated effect on infiltration, and their combination, on the indoor comfort and the energy performance of the building. The outcomes were displayed in a simple Energy-needs/transformation cost chart and a Pareto curve was selected, identifying an optimal subset of solutions. Adequate indoor conditions can be obtained with the implementation of only passive strategies, mainly empowering the thermal insulation of walls, roofs and windows using simple, low cost, local technologies, and the control of the heat transmission toward the soil: the energy poverty of the informal settlements of Cuzco can be fought with very simple initiatives, that require investments with a reasonably short return of investment.","[Gutierrez, Gino; De Angelis, Enrico] Politecn Milan, ABC Dept, Via Ponzio 31, Milan, Italy","De Angelis, E (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, ABC Dept, Via Ponzio 31, Milan, Italy.",enrico.deangelis@polimi.it,"De Angelis, Enrico/C-3621-2019","De Angelis, Enrico/0000-0003-2354-7095",,,"GIZ-MVCS, 2015, ABRIGANDO HOGARES E; Hashempour N, 2020, SUSTAIN CITIES SOC, V54, DOI 10.1016/j.scs.2019.10196; Hidalgo-Cordero JF, 2018, IND CROP PROD, V112, P467, DOI 10.1016/j.indcrop.2017.12.02; International Energy Agency (IEA), 2019, WORLD EN OUT; JO Molina MJ, 2020, TECNIA, V3; Ma ZJ, 2012, ENERG BUILDINGS, V55, P889, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.08.01; Pellegrino M, 2016, ENERG BUILDINGS, V113, P145, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.12.01; Teli D, 2017, PROCEDIA ENVIRON SCI, V38, P844, DOI 10.1016/j.proenv.2017.03.17",8,0,0,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12158,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012158,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100158,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.0016386726751331422,5.732923914401656e-12,0.008576593217637537,0.08348724262945482,0.008576593217637537

The quasi-experimental research method with the non-equivalent pretest-posttest control-group design was used in this study. A total of 45 students in seventh grade from a private junior high school in Prabumulih participated in this study and were grouped into 24 students in experimental class and 21 students in comparison class. Essay questions are used as the instruments in pre- and post-learning to measure students' understanding five aspects of NOS, which are subjective, tentative, empirical, observation, and social and cultural. The results show that the percentage of students in the experimental class who display an increase in NOS understanding is greater than the students in the comparison class. This study shows that explicit-reflective learning with the SSI context could be used to develop students' understanding of NOS.","[Habiby, I; Hernani; Riandi] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Sekolah Pascasarjana, Dept Pendidikan IPA, Jl Dr Setiabudhi 229, Bandung 40154, Indonesia","Habiby, I; Hernani (corresponding author), Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Sekolah Pascasarjana, Dept Pendidikan IPA, Jl Dr Setiabudhi 229, Bandung 40154, Indonesia.",iqbalhabiby@upi.edu; hernani@upi.edu,,,,,"Akerson VL, 2019, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V28, P391, DOI 10.1007/s11191-019-00045-; Akerson VL, 2011, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V20, P537, DOI 10.1007/s10956-011-9312-; [Anonymous], REGULATION MINISTE; Creswell J., 2015, RISET KUALITATIF KU; Eastwood JL, 2012, INT J SCI EDUC, V34, P2289, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2012.66758; Herman BC, 2019, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V28, P329, DOI 10.1007/s11191-019-00034-; Holbrook J, 2007, INT J SCI EDUC, V29, P1347, DOI 10.1080/0950069060100754; Hurd PD, 1998, SCI EDUC, V82, P407, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(199806)82:3<407::AID-SCE6>3.0.CO;2-; Khishfe R, 2006, J RES SCI TEACH, V43, P395, DOI 10.1002/tea.2013; Khishfe R, 2007, INT J SCI EDUC, V29, P939, DOI 10.1080/0950069060111094; Khishfe R, 2017, INT J SCI EDUC, V39, P403, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2017.128797; Khishfe R, 2017, INT J SCI EDUC, V39, P299, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2017.128074; Khishfe R, 2014, INT J SCI EDUC, V36, P974, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2013.83200; Khishfe R, 2012, INT J SCI EDUC, V34, P67, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2011.55949; Lederman NG, 2013, INT J EDUC MATH SCI, V1, P13; Mansour N, 2016, RES SCI EDUC, V46, P667, DOI 10.1007/s11165-015-9475-; OECD, 2019, PISA 2018 RES SNAPS; Sadler TD, 2006, INT J SCI EDUC, V28, P1463, DOI 10.1080/0950069060070871; Wati F, 2017, J PHYS C SERIES, V895, P; Zhu YZ, 2019, INT J SCI EDUC, V41, P2094, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2019.166092",20,0,0,1,6,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1806.0,,,,,,,,12122,10.1088/1742-6596/1806/1/012122,,6,"Education, Scientific Disciplines",Education & Educational Research,BR6UL,WOS:000664182600121,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.0030632562413845914,4.566277059176481e-11,0.03888416276584469,0.12222700638373551,0.039096054494868665

This flexibility potential can be expressed in flexibility factors. The usefulness of four factors is investigated based on load control for the heat pump of a small apartment building according to electricity prices (high/low tariffs, spot market prices), CO2eq emissions share in the grid and a restricted operation period during daytime. The calculation methodology of the presented flexibility factors GSC, RIP, FF and FI is very different. RIP and FF are preferable because they have defined valid ranges which makes them easier to understand. Current electricity prices force the heat pump operation mainly into the night. The optimization of CO2eq emissions encourages operation mainly during the day. The optimization goals costs or CO2eq emissions thus lead to opposing heat pump operation times and can currently therefore not both be met simultaneously.","[Hall, Monika; Geissler, Achim] Univ Appl Sci & Arts Northwestern Switzerland, Inst Sustainabil & Energy Construct, Hofackerstr 30, CH-4132 Muttenz, Switzerland","Hall, M (corresponding author), Univ Appl Sci & Arts Northwestern Switzerland, Inst Sustainabil & Energy Construct, Hofackerstr 30, CH-4132 Muttenz, Switzerland.",monika.hall@fhnw.ch,,,Swiss Federal Office of Energy SFOE [BFE SI/501240],The work described in this paper was funded by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy SFOE under contract number BFE SI/501240 as a contribution to IEA Annex 67 Energy Flexible Buildings.,"[Anonymous], 2015, MERKBLATT SIA 202; [Anonymous], 2007, SN ISO 13786200; [Anonymous], 2015, SIA 38; Clarke J., ENERGY SYSTEMS RES ; Dar UI, 2014, ENERG BUILDINGS, V69, P74, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.10.01; EPEX SPOT Market DATA, INTRADAY AUCTIONS D; Hoffmann C., 2018, P 4 BPSA ENGL C BUIL, P23; Industrielle Werke Basel, STROMTARIFE 2020 IN; Junker RG, 2018, APPL ENERG, V225, P175, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.03; Klein K, 2017, APPL ENERG, V203, P917, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.06.07; Le Dreau J, 2016, ENERGY, V111, P991, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2016.05.07; Statistika, 2019, HAUSHALTSSTROMPREI",12,1,1,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12036,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012036,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100036,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.0024580090126997134,1.2403985719709407e-16,0.002457379528728012,0.05341473555220027,0.0024573795287280123

The science process skills of high school physics students in Tapaktuan for each aspect of science process skills are still low, with an average percentage of 48.9%.","[Harja, M.; Sinaga, P.] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Grad Sch, Dept Phys Educ, Jl Dr Setiabudi 229, Bandung 40154, Indonesia","Harja, M (corresponding author), Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Grad Sch, Dept Phys Educ, Jl Dr Setiabudi 229, Bandung 40154, Indonesia.",muhammadharja@gmail.com,,,,,"Arsyad A, 1997, MEDIA PENGAJARA; Karamustafaoglu, 2011, EURASIAN J PHYS CHEM, V3, P2; Lestari TP, 2016, KETERAMPILAN DASAR ; Megasari R, 2020, BAHANA MANAJEMEN PEN, V2, P63; Rahman A, 2017, SCH ED J PGSD FIP UN, V7, P; Rustaman N, 2010, MATERI DAN PEMBELAJ; Rustaman NY., 2011, P BIOL ED C BIOL SCI, V8, P1; Sugiyono, 2011, METODE PENELITIAN P; Suja IW, 2016, JURNAL PENDIDIKAN DA, V39, P20; Sukarno, 2013, INT J SCI ENG RES IJ, V1, P7; Tuu T, 2004, PERAN DISIPLIN PAD; Zulika AM, 2018, WAPFI WAHANA PENDIDI, V3, P8",12,0,0,0,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1806.0,,,,,,,,12016,10.1088/1742-6596/1806/1/012016,,6,"Education, Scientific Disciplines",Education & Educational Research,BR6UL,WOS:000664182600016,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.001837953744830755,4.516063843316781e-15,0.012592895036486286,0.08416805249384435,0.012488991489218022

This research was a mix-method study with selected research subjects who were four independent learners, three instruction learners, and three frustration learners of class VII in Baleendah. The instruments of this study were test and non-test (interviews and mathematical resilience questionnaires). The results showed that: (1) the excellent mathematical resilience of the independent learner impacted the positive outcomes of students in overcoming difficulties that existed in mathematical application problems. But, students' who had good mathematical resilience (medium category) didn't affect overcoming obstacles in word problems; (2) good mathematical resilience (medium category) from the instruction learner had a positive impact on overcoming challenges in word problems. Mathematical resilience in frustration learner (medium category, but partly low group) had an effect on the complexity of solving mathematical problems, and (3) mathematical resilience in frustration learner who got very low/low grade affects the challenge of solving mathematical application problems. However, students at the level of frustration have an excellent resilience ability (medium category) but do not modify the difficulties they experience (still having trouble) in solving word problems.","[Harsela, K.; Asih, E.

The method used in this study is a quasi-experiment with the design of one group pre-test and post-test. The subjects of this study were students of prospective physics teachers at Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa University consisting of 13 male students and 12 female students with an average age of 20 years. The instrument used in this study was a test of high-level thinking skills on magnetic electric material, in the form of 10 breakdown tests. Each question evaluates aspects of analysing, evaluating, create. The average N-gain results in the physics teacher candidates at the Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa University were 0.37 in the medium category. So, it can be concluded that the higher order thinking by using the direct learning model of prospective physics teacher students at the Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa University is included in the medium category. Based on these results it shows that direct instruction learning model is quite effective to improve higher order thinking skills in learning physics, especially magnetic electric material.","[Haryadi, R.] Univ Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa, Pendidikan Fis, Jl Raya Jakarta KM 04, Pakupatan 42111, Serang, Indonesia; [Haryadi, R.; Situmorang, R.; Khaerudin] Univ Negeri Jakarta, Teknol Pendidikan, Daerah Khusus Ibukota Ja 13220, Indonesia","Haryadi, R (corresponding author), Univ Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa, Pendidikan Fis, Jl Raya Jakarta KM 04, Pakupatan 42111, Serang, Indonesia.;Haryadi, R (corresponding author), Univ Negeri Jakarta, Teknol Pendidikan, Daerah Khusus Ibukota Ja 13220, Indonesia.",rudiharyadi@untirta.ac.id,"Haryadi, Rudi/ADW-1927-2022",,,,"Aldallal SN, 2019, BRIT J ORAL MAX SURG, V57, P1049, DOI 10.1016/j.bjoms.2019.09.01; Barak M, 2009, J SCI TEACH EDUC, V20, P459, DOI 10.1007/s10972-009-9141-; Cook CE, 2020, BRAZ J PHYS THER, V24, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.bjpt.2019.01.01; Dick W., 2015, SYSTEMATIC DESIGN IN, V8t; Din N, 2016, PROCD SOC BEHV, V222, P219, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.05.15; Enyedy N, 2012, INT J COMP-SUPP COLL, V7, P347, DOI 10.1007/s11412-012-9150-; Hake RR, 1998, AM J PHYS, V66, P64, DOI 10.1119/1.1880; Haryadi R, 2019, J PHYS CONF SER, V1157, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1157/3/03200; Haryadi R, 2020, J PHYS C SER, V148; Haryadi R, 2019, J PENELIT PENGEMB PE, V5, P18; Higgins S, 2016, MANAGING HIGHER ORDE, P2; Ichsan I Z, 2019, INT J ED VOCAT STUD, V1, P2; Jensen JL, 2014, EDUC PSYCHOL REV, V26, P307, DOI 10.1007/s10648-013-9248-; Kadzinski M, 2020, INT J APPROX REASON, V117, P60, DOI 10.1016/j.ijar.2019.11.00; Kantar LD, 2014, NURS EDUC TODAY, V34, P789, DOI 10.1016/j.nedt.2013.08.01; Kawaguchi-Suzuki M, 2018, CURR PHARM TEACH LEA, V10, P946, DOI 10.1016/j.cptl.2018.04.01; Louws ML, 2017, TEACH TEACH EDUC, V66, P171, DOI 10.1016/j.tate.2017.04.00; Magas CP, 2017, AM J SURG, V213, P222, DOI 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2016.08.02; Merlone U, 2019, CHAOS SOLITON FRACT, V126, P253, DOI 10.1016/j.chaos.2019.06.00; Merta Dhewa K., 2017, IOSR J RES METHOD ED, V7, P2; Nasri N M, 2017, KASETSART J SOC SCI, P; Pacanowski CR, 2020, J NUTR EDUC BEHAV, V52, P369, DOI 10.1016/j.jneb.2019.08.01; Pujiastuti H, 2020, JURNAL PENDIDIKAN IP, V9, P59, DOI DOI 10.15294/JPII.V9I1.2174; Rashid T, 2016, COMPUT HUM BEHAV, V63, P604, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2016.05.08; Roets L, 2017, NURS EDUC TODAY, V49, P51, DOI 10.1016/j.nedt.2016.11.00; Saribas D, 2009, PROCEDIA SOC BEHAV ; Saritepeci M, 2020, ASIA-PAC EDUC RES, V29, P35, DOI 10.1007/s40299-019-00480-; Schweder S, 2019, J ADOLESCENCE, V73, P73, DOI 10.1016/j.adolescence.2019.04.00; Serevina V, 2019, J PHYS C SER, V1185, P; Siriwongs P, 2015, PROCD SOC BEHV, V197, P2074, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.07.57; Sriarunrasmee J, 2015, PROCD SOC BEHV, V197, P1564, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.07.11; Toh W, 2020, COMPUT EDUC, V154, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2020.10391; Zohar A, 1999, TEACH TEACH EDUC, V15, P413, DOI 10.1016/S0742-051X(98)00063-; Zohar A, 2001, TEACH TEACH EDUC, V17, P469, DOI 10.1016/S0742-051X(01)00007-",34,0,0,2,2,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1806.0,,,,,,,,12042,10.1088/1742-6596/1806/1/012042,,7,"Education, Scientific Disciplines",Education & Educational Research,BR6UL,WOS:000664182600042,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.005207535610353806,5.570843771856893e-13,0.1896668916857981,0.12014426881107042,0.19069567133512477

To deal with the problem, the Government issued Bantuan Sosial Covid-19 (Bansos Covid-19), a social aid programme for the population impacted by the pandemic. The implementation of Bansos Covid-19 and its effects are reported and discussed in several online news media in Indonesia. This study aims to present the issues of Bansos Covid-19 implementation as reported by the online news media from the perspective of the concept of resilient society suggested by Patel, Rogets, Amlot, and Rumin (2017). Using a content analysis method, this study analysed news items containing keywords Bantuan Sosial Covid-19 published between 1 April and 30 June 2020. Textual data analysis was conducted by using the N-Vivo program, software dna.20 - beta2.5, and visualisation of results with visone 2.18. This study found that there are some issues arising from the implementation of Bansos Covid-19, including the problems of data validity, the overlapping regulations, the distribution management, and the disposition of the program implementer. This study also identifies some positive effects including the support of the business sector and various community groups.

Predominantly, the GCs are used to connect the foundation piles with the jacket support structure. Additionally, it can be applied for monopile substructures. A challenging and scientifically still marginally analysed detail of grouted connections is the influence of early age movement (EAM), also known as early age cycling (EAC) on the final load bearing behaviour of the connection. After grouting and until the end of the curing of the material, the offshore structure is partially supported by fluid grout material for several hours. During this time waves and current affect the soft connections. This leads to relative movement during the curing of GCs, which is known as EAM. Previous investigations showed grout material damage due to vertical EAM. These results form the basis of the current offshore guideline limits. According to DNVGL-OS-J101 from 2014, it must be ensured that during the curing process the vertical EAM does not exceed 1 mm. Since 2016 the limit value also applies for the lateral EAM according to DNVGL. However, the influence of lateral EAM on the load bearing behaviour is barely experimentally nor numerically investigated. Thus, the authors are involved in a comprehensive research project (GREAM) addressing this topic. This paper focusses on Finite Element Analysis of different support structures under varying boundary conditions and sea states to analyse the amplitude of lateral EAM of grouted connections.","[Henneberg, Joshua; Schaumann, Peter] Inst Steel Construct Forwind, Appelstr 9A, D-30167 Hannover, Germany","Henneberg, J (corresponding author), Inst Steel Construct Forwind, Appelstr 9A, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",henneberg@stahl.uni-hannover.de,,"Schaumann, Peter/0000-0001-8543-960X",German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) [0324257]; BMWi; DNV GL; Siemens Gamesa; Wilke & Schiele Consulting GmbH; BAM and Pagel Spezial-Beton GmbH Co.

On the other hand students are prohibited from bringing mobile devices to school, with the reason to interfere with the lesson. Teachers and schools need to get help and guidance, so they can maximize learning even in the pandemic. The problem raised is how to improve the skills of teachers in online learning during the co-19 pandemic? The purpose of this activity is to provide skills as well as an understanding of how to use information technology for effective, efficient and safe learning from negative stigma that has been feared by schools and teachers. This activity using the guided training method and was carried out in four stages namely observation, training, mentoring and evaluation.

The present publication focuses on the impact on the microclimate. The analysis comprises the simulation of forty-seven data sets in a microclimatic model with ENVI-met. The results show that during daytime the PET for the whole neighborhood ranges between 30.1 and 36.4 degrees C. Choosing a bright instead of a dark color can lower the PET between 0.2 and 1.0 K. Dark colored metal sheets may cause turbulences which lead to a reduction of the PET between 2.0 and 3.8 K (compared to a bright metal sheet). However, this effect may not be reproducible under varying boundary conditions. During night-time, the resulting span of ambient temperatures between the materials reaches 21.4 to 22.0 degrees C (level 1.7 m).

The 1D momentum theory emerges from an inviscid, steady and irrotational analysis of the streamtube surrounding a wind turbine while the wake aerodynamics under yaw is modified. In this work, the mean flow streamtube around a single DTU 10MW wind turbine, under yaw misalignement and turbulent inflow is investigated with Large-Eddy Simulation combined to the Actuator Line method. The simulations are performed on a highly resolved grid counting billions of elements. The streamtube construction from the mean flow is based on the transport of accurate conservative level set functions. Integration of local flow quantities within the streamtube presents similarities when the streamtube expansion occurs past the turbine until the velocity deficit starts to recover. Mean kinetic energy and momentum budget are then presented to explain the yawed wake recovery and deflection process. Background turbulence plays a key role in the recovery process while the deflection of the wake is impacted by pressure forces on the streamtube. From these budgets, four wake regions showing similar flow dynamics are defined and correlated to local flow structures.","[Houtin-Mongrolle, F.; Benard, P.; Lartigue, G.; Moureau, V] Normandie Univ, INSA Rouen, UNIROUEN, CNRS,CORIA, F-76000 Rouen, France","Houtin-Mongrolle, F (corresponding author), Normandie Univ, INSA Rouen, UNIROUEN, CNRS,CORIA, F-76000 Rouen, France.",felix.houtin-mongrolle@coria.fr,"Mongrolle, Félix Houtin/ABF-4305-2020; MOUREAU, Vincent/E-5544-2013","Mongrolle, Félix Houtin/0000-0001-9849-1829; MOUREAU, Vincent/0000-0003-4574-7709","PRACE project untitled Wind Turbines Multi Physics [2020225444]; GENCI, France [A0082A11335]; CRIANN, France [2012006]","This work was granted access to HPC resources from TGCC, France through the PRACE project untitled Wind Turbines Multi Physics under the allocation 2020225444 and through GENCI, France under allocation A0082A11335 and from CRIANN, France, under the allocation 2012006.","Bak C, 2013, 10MW DT; Bastankhah M, 2016, J FLUID MECH, V806, P506, DOI 10.1017/jfm.2016.59; Benard P, 2018, COMPUT FLUIDS, V173, P133, DOI 10.1016/j.compfluid.2018.03.01; Breton SP, 2017, PHILOS T R SOC A, V375, DOI 10.1098/rsta.2016.009; Desjardins O, 2008, J COMPUT PHYS, V227, P8395, DOI 10.1016/j.jcp.2008.05.02; Ge MW, 2021, RENEW ENERG, V163, P1063, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2020.08.15; Gebraad PMO, 2016, WIND ENERGY, V19, P95, DOI 10.1002/we.182; GERMANO M, 1991, PHYS FLUIDS A-FLUID, V3, P1760, DOI 10.1063/1.85795; Kraushaar M., 2011, THESIS INP; Mann J, 1998, PROBABILIST ENG MECH, V13, P269, DOI 10.1016/S0266-8920(97)00036-; Manolas D I, 2015, EUR WIND EN ASS AN; Meneveau C, 2012, J TURBUL, V13, P1, DOI 10.1080/14685248.2011.66309; Meyers J, 2013, J FLUID MECH, V715, P335, DOI 10.1017/jfm.2012.52; Moureau V, 2011, CR MECANIQUE, V339, P141, DOI 10.1016/j.crme.2010.12.00; Noca F, 1999, J FLUID STRUCT, V13, P551, DOI 10.1006/jfls.1999.021; Porte-Agel F, 2020, BOUND-LAY METEOROL, V174, P1, DOI 10.1007/s10546-019-00473-; S~rensen J N., 2016, GEN MOMENTUM THEORY, V; Sorensen JN, 2002, J FLUID ENG-T ASME, V124, P393, DOI 10.1115/1.147136; West JR, 2020, ENERGIES, V13, DOI 10.3390/en1305107; Wu YT, 2012, ENERGIES, V5, P5340, DOI 10.3390/en512534; Zong HH, 2020, J FLUID MECH, V889, DOI 10.1017/jfm.2020.7",21,1,1,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1934.0,,,,,,,,12011,10.1088/1742-6596/1934/1/012011,,10,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Mechanical; Mechanics; Physics, Fluids & Plasmas",Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Mechanics; Physics,BS3JN,WOS:000712011500011,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-07-14,0.0043015157722244984,0.004391019316687481,0.0490159753848821,0.13965329824360662,0.05041056714211555

However, the approaches used to translate greenhouse gas emissions to a global warming potential score are largely criticised. By following a static approach (known as 0/0) and a time-dependent approach (known as dynamic) in this paper, we assessed the environmental impacts of two buildings with structures made of reinforced concrete and wood, respectively. The relative difference between the results calculated with the 0/0 approach and the time-dependent approach were larger for the building with the wooden structure. A more detailed analysis identified biogenic carbon as the source that was most responsible for this difference in results. For this reason, biogenic carbon should be treated separately and must be calculated with the time-dependent approach. Meanwhile, the impacts from fossil energy sources should be calculated with the 0/0 approach.","[Hoxha, Endrit; Passer, Alexander] Graz Univ Technol, Inst Technol & Testing Construct Mat, Inffeldgasse 24, A-8010 Graz, Austria","Hoxha, E (corresponding author), Graz Univ Technol, Inst Technol & Testing Construct Mat, Inffeldgasse 24, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",endrit.hoxha@tugraz.at; alexander.passer@tugraz.at,"Hoxha, Endrit/AAM-5406-2021; Hoxha, Endrit/AGZ-9115-2022",,"Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT) via the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) [864142]; Klima-und Energiefonds [ACRP11 KR18AC0K14693]","The analysis and results described in this paper relate to ongoing research within the international project IEA EBC Annex 72 and ParisBuildings, which are financially supported by the Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT) via the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) Grant #864142 and the Klima-und Energiefonds, ACRP11 KR18AC0K14693.

EC glazing can modulate the light entering through the facade by varying the solar transmittance of the glass and therefore can work as a shading strategy to minimize solar heat gains or glare. However, it also alters the spectrum and distribution of light entering through the facade, which influences certain visual attributes associated with a space. This user assessment study evaluates some of these attributes including the colour perception of the elements inside and outside the room, the uniformity of daylight distribution, the clarity of the view through the glazing and the perception of glare when the sun is in the field of view. Results indicate a visual transmittance (tv) of 0.6% is sufficient to control glare when the sun is in the peripheral field of view (FOV) while tv, n-n of 0.14% is required to control glare when the sun is close to the central FOV. Most of the participants did not perceive the colours of outdoor environment as natural when seen through EC glazed window.

The complexity of urban morphology can lead to undesired wind conditions or excessive air temperature; particularly in extreme weather conditions. This study attempts to quantify the impacts of urban morphology on the evolution of wind speed and air temperature at the urban canopy layer using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations. In this regard, three urban neighbourhoods are generated based on a novel urban morphology parameterization method and assessed in two extreme low and high wind conditions. Results showed that wind speed (up to 75%) and air temperature (up to 28%) at the microscale can get amplified or dampened in extreme conditions. A negative correlation was observed between wind speed and air temperature variations indicating a great potential to reduce outdoor air temperature through heat removal in urban canyons. The findings of the study are categorized based on the morphological parameters to present a series of design-based strategies for the newly-built urban neighbourhoods.","[Javanroodi, K.; Scartezzini, Jl] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Nik, V.

Through linear, frequency-domain statistical analysis of floating turbine motion and applying acceptable motion limits for technician working, significant wave height and peak wave period limits are investigated. It was found that over the range of wave conditions considered, the turbine nacelle motion did not exceed the motion limits for technician working considered in this analysis. Further analysis found that the turbine nacelle motion increased with increasing significant wave height and was also significantly influenced by peak wave period. The impact of differing wave characteristics is also investigated through the use of different wave energy spectra and also found to have an impact on turbine nacelle motion.","[Jenkins, Brian; Prothero, Arran; Collu, Maurizio; Carroll, James; McMillan, David] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [McDonald, Alasdair] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Jenkins, B (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",brian.jenkins@strath.ac.uk,,,EPSRC through the Wind and Marine Energy Systems Centre for Doctoral Training [EP/L016680/1],The authors would like to acknowledge EPSRC for funding this work through the Wind and Marine Energy Systems Centre for Doctoral Training under the grant number EP/L016680/1.,"Allen C, 2020, DEFINITION UMAINE V; Carbon Trust, 2020, FLOAT WIND JOINT IN; Gaertner E, 2020, IEA WIND TCP TASK 3; Gherbi A, 2020, STOCHASTIC ANAL BASI, P50; Guanche R, 2016, OCEAN ENG, V116, P216, DOI 10.1016/j.oceaneng.2016.03.01; Hasselmann K., 1973, ERGNZUNGSH DTSCH HYD, V8, P1, DOI 10.1093/ije/27.2.33; Journee J.M.J., 2001, OFFSHORE HYDRODYNAMI, V1st ed; Martini M, 2016, ENRGY PROCED, V94, P249, DOI 10.1016/j.egypro.2016.09.23; Mitchell M, 2019, ENGUAGE DIGITIZER S; Pegalajar-Jurado A, 2018, WIND ENERGY SCI, V3, P693, DOI 10.5194/wes-3-693-201; Prendergast J, 2020, IEEE J OCEANIC ENG, V45, P271, DOI 10.1109/JOE.2018.286963; Riggs HR, 2016, SPRINGER HANDBOOK OF OCEAN ENGINEERING, P85; Scheu M, 2018, OCEAN ENG, V165, P293, DOI 10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.07.01; Shafiee M, 2016, INT J LIFE CYCLE ASS, V21, P961, DOI 10.1007/s11367-016-1075-",14,1,1,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2018.0,,,,,,,,12023,10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/012023,,10,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Mechanical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BS3LW,WOS:000713005900023,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2022-07-14,0.0028676771814829987,1.1625406641912969e-06,0.009538233145449652,0.10931971875139952,0.0076581175945302695

The wake properties depend on many parameters such as the stratification, Coriolis force, large-scale forcing and orography. To simulate this interdependence, the actuator line method (ALM) has been implemented in the atmospheric code Meso-NH, which is an LES research code developed by the French weather services. This implementation has already been validated for the blade force distribution on the NewMexico case (uniform inflow in a wind tunnel) and for the interaction with the atmosphere on the Horns Rev photo case. The work presented here aims at completing the validation in a realistic atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), with a focus on velocity deficit and wake meandering. It is based on the international SWiFT benchmark which compares the results of many numerical models with LiDAR measurements in the wake of a single turbine for three cases of atmospheric stability: neutral, unstable and stable. The good results show the capacity of Meso-NH/ALM to generate realistic wakes in a representative ABL.","[Jezequel, E.; Cathelain, M.; Blondel, F.] IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1-4 Ave Bois Preau, Rueil Malmaison, France; [Jezequel, E.; Masson, V] Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, Toulouse, France","Jezequel, E (corresponding author), IFP Energies Nouvelles, 1-4 Ave Bois Preau, Rueil Malmaison, France.;Jezequel, E (corresponding author), Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, Toulouse, France.",erwan.jezequel@ifpen.fr,,"Jezequel, Erwan/0000-0001-5024-364X; Blondel, Frederic/0000-0002-3252-2781",,,"Abkar M, 2015, PHYS FLUIDS, V27, DOI 10.1063/1.491369; Cuxart J, 2000, Q J ROY METEOR SOC, V126, P1, DOI 10.1002/qj.4971265620; DEARDORFF JW, 1980, BOUND-LAY METEOROL, V18, P495, DOI 10.1007/BF0011950; Doubrawa P, 2019, J PHYS CONF SER, V1256, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1256/1/01202; Doubrawa P, 2020, WIND ENERGY, V23, P2027, DOI 10.1002/we.254; Englberger A, 2020, WIND ENERGY SCI, V5, P1359, DOI 10.5194/wes-5-1359-202; Honnert R, 2021, FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ, V8, DOI 10.3389/feart.2020.58205; Jha PK, 2014, J SOL ENERG-T ASME, V136, DOI 10.1115/1.402625; Joulin P A, FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ, P; Kelley C.L., 2016, SWIFT SITE ATMOSPHE; Lac C, 2018, GEOSCI MODEL DEV, V11, P1929, DOI 10.5194/gmd-11-1929-201; Lafore JP, 1998, ANN GEOPHYS-ATM HYDR, V16, P90, DOI 10.1007/s00585-997-0090-; Larsen GC, 2008, WIND ENERGY, V11, P377, DOI 10.1002/we.26; Mikkelsen T, 2013, WIND ENERGY, V16, P625, DOI 10.1002/we.156; Quon EW, 2020, J PHYS CONF SER, V1452, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1452/1/01207; Sorensen JN, 2002, J FLUID ENG-T ASME, V124, P393, DOI 10.1115/1.147136; Stein J, 2000, METEOROL ATMOS PHYS, V72, P203, DOI 10.1007/s00703005001; Stull RB., 1988, INTRO BOUNDARY LAYER, DOI 10.1007/978-94-009-3027-",18,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1934.0,,,,,,,,12003,10.1088/1742-6596/1934/1/012003,,10,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Mechanical; Mechanics; Physics, Fluids & Plasmas",Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Mechanics; Physics,BS3JN,WOS:000712011500003,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-07-14,0.00368701351904957,0.00018184007378526813,0.032523717625110006,0.13444591319673938,0.023137586339188963

The characteristics of symbol sense are usually used, for instance, for designing symbolic algebra tasks, but are a bit rare for designing mathematics tasks in general. Therefore, this study aims to use symbol sense characteristics for designing mathematics tasks for secondary school students. To do this, using a design research method, we conducted a literature study to collect characteristics of symbol sense and to see possibilities of designing mathematics tasks in general. Next, we designed mathematics tasks according to the symbol sense characteristics. Finally, we provided possible responses of students for the designed tasks. The results of this study included six types of tasks according to the characteristics of symbol sense, including tasks on symbolic problems and word problems-which require translation into symbolic problems. In addition, we provided predicted responses to examples for each type of the tasks and suggestions for use in the learning and teaching process.

However, in this study it was found that the response of students to aspects of scientific literacy ability had the lowest score (82.34%) compared to other aspects, this was because the students of class XI MIA-3 in one of the MA Ma'arif Blitar were just introduced. scientific literacy in the learning process.","[Kholiq, A.; Khoiriah, M.] Univ Negeri Surabaya, Dept Phys, Kota Sby, Jawa Timur, Indonesia","Kholiq, A (corresponding author), Univ Negeri Surabaya, Dept Phys, Kota Sby, Jawa Timur, Indonesia.",kholiq@unesa.ac.id,"Kholiq, Abd./AAB-8161-2021","Kholiq, Abd./0000-0001-8440-1538",,,"Fajar H, 2016, UPEJ UNNES PHYS ED J, V5, P; Firdausy B A, 2017, J MHS PENDIDIK SAINS, V5, P37; Fitriani W, 2014, J PENDIDIK PEMBELAJA, V; Ghofur A, 2015, JIPF J INOV PENDIDIK, V4, P17; Haristy D R, 2013, PEMBELAJARAN KHATULI, V2, P; Kemendikbud, 2016, MEDIA KOMUNIKASI DA; Kusumawati AT, 2020, J PHYS CONF SER, V1491, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1491/1/01207; Liliasari, 2014, PERSIAPAN LITERASI S, P; OECD, 2019, PIS; OECD, 2017, PISA 2015 RE; Rahmah A, 2015, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V72, P94, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2015.12.10; Riduwan, 2015, SKALA PENGUKURAN VA; Siegenthaler E, 2010, J USABILITY STUD, V6, P2; Sudarisman S, 2015, FLOREA J BIOL PEMBEL, V2, P2; Susanti M, 2015, UPEJ UNNES PHYS ED J, V4, P4; Udompong L, 2014, PROCD SOC BEHV, V116, P1581, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.01.43; Yager RE., 2000, SCH SCI MATH, V100, P327, DOI [10.1111/j.1949-8594.2000.tb17327.x, DOI 10.1111/j.1949-8594.2000.tb17327.x",17,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1805.0,,,,,,,,12042,10.1088/1742-6596/1805/1/012042,,7,"Physics, Multidisciplinary",Physics,BR6XL,WOS:000664519500042,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.002603767805176903,1.2734665339507722e-15,0.0048955790004775075,0.08211648995711178,0.0048955790004775075

Using a short video and a few photos from the occupant position, the 3D space geometry is automatically reconstructed. Retrieved 3D context enables the back-projection of the camera-captured luminance distribution into 3D spaces that are in turn re-projected to occupant-FOVs. The framework was tested and validated in a testbed office. The re-projected luminance field showed with good agreement with luminance measured at the occupant position. The new method can be used for non-intrusive luminance monitoring integrated with daylighting control applications.","[Kim, Michael; Tzempelikos, Athanasios] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Kim, Michael; Tzempelikos, Athanasios] Purdue Univ, Ctr High Performance Bldg, Ray W Herrick Labs, 140 Martin Jischke Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Tzempelikos, A (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.;Tzempelikos, A (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Ctr High Performance Bldg, Ray W Herrick Labs, 140 Martin Jischke Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",ttzempel@purdue.edu,,,,,"Adam GK, 2019, ELECTRONICS-SWITZ, V8, DOI 10.3390/electronics801003; Amundadottir ML, 2017, BUILD ENVIRON, V113, P5, DOI 10.1016/j.buildenv.2016.09.03; Andersen M, 2015, BUILD ENVIRON, V91, P101, DOI 10.1016/j.buildenv.2015.03.01; Aries MBC, 2015, LIGHTING RES TECHNOL, V47, P6, DOI 10.1177/147715351350925; Borisuit A, EFFECTS REALISTIC O; Boyce PR, 2014, HUMAN FACTORS IN LIGHTING, 3RD EDITION, P1, DOI 10.1201/b1670; Cauwerts C, 2018, J IMAGING, V4, DOI 10.3390/jimaging401001; Debevec P.

In recent years the field of Reinforcement Learning has made great contributions to nonlinear control problems and has been successfully applied to control and optimization in 2D laminar flows. In this work, Reinforcement Learning is applied to wind farm control for the first time to the authors' best knowledge. To demonstrate the optimization abilities of the newly developed framework, parameters of an already existing control strategy, the helix approach, are tuned to optimize the total power production of a small wind farm. This also includes an extension of the helix approach to multiple turbines. Furthermore, it is attempted to develop novel control strategies based on the control of the generator torque. The results are analysed and difficulties in the setup in regards to Reinforcement Learning are discussed. The tuned helix approach yields a total power increase of 6.8 % on average for the investigated case, while the generator torque controller does not yield an increase in total power. Finally, an alternative setup is proposed to improve the design of the problem.","[Korb, Henry; Asmuth, Henrik; Ivanell, Stefan] Uppsala Univ, Wind Energy Sect, Campus Gotland, S-62157 Visby, Sweden; [Stender, Merten] Hamburg Univ Technol, Dynam Grp, Am Schwarzenberg Campus 1, D-21073 Hamburg, Germany","Korb, H (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Wind Energy Sect, Campus Gotland, S-62157 Visby, Sweden.",henry.korb@geo.uu.se,"; Stender, Merten/D-8344-2018","Korb, Henry/0000-0003-3177-5960; Stender, Merten/0000-0002-0888-8206; Ivanell, Stefan/0000-0003-4896-6771",,,"Asmuth H, 2020, WIND ENERGY SCI, V5, P623, DOI 10.5194/wes-5-623-202; Asmuth H, 2019, J PHYS CONF SER, V1256, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1256/1/01202; Frederik JA, 2020, WIND ENERGY, V23, P1739, DOI 10.1002/we.251; Frederik JA, 2020, WIND ENERGY SCI, V5, P245, DOI 10.5194/wes-5-245-202; Ghorbani A, 2019, THIRTY-THIRD AAAI CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE / THIRTY-FIRST INNOVATIVE APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CONFERENCE / NINTH AAAI SYMPOSIUM ON EDUCATIONAL ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, P368; Hansen M.

However, MPC is rarely applied in buildings since the implementation and modeling is complex, time consuming and costly. To bring MPC into practice, controllers and models are needed, that automatically adapt their behavior to the controlled system. In this work, such a self-adjusting MPC applicable to heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is developed. The MPC is based on a simple grey-box model that is able to cover the general dynamics of the considered subsystem. The controller adapts the model parameters online according to the past measurements of the controlled system using a moving horizon estimation. The developed self-adjusting MPC is applied to three heating coils in a simulation. Compared with a PID controller, the self-adjusting MPC is able to increase the control quality up to 10 %, while no manual tuning is needed.

This paper examines unilaterally and bilaterally illuminated classrooms in terms of quantitative and qualitative requirements for daylighting in classrooms during both winter and summer. The results of measurements and simulations pointed out the advantages of bilaterally illuminated classrooms when compared to unilaterally illuminated ones. In winter, the windows placed on two opposite walls provide a significantly higher uniformity of daylight. In summer, in addition to the improved uniformity, this window arrangement offers higher variability in shading strategies, resulting in greater availability of daylight and better visual comfort. These factors can potentially prevent or limit the development of myopia.","[Liberska, Martina; Maierova, Lenka] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Prague, Czech Republic; [Maierova, Lenka] Czech Tech Univ, Univ Ctr Energy Efficient Bldg, Prague, Czech Republic","Maierova, L (corresponding author), Czech Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Prague, Czech Republic.;Maierova, L (corresponding author), Czech Tech Univ, Univ Ctr Energy Efficient Bldg, Prague, Czech Republic.",lenka.maierova@fsv.cvut.cz,"Maierova, Lenka/G-4165-2019","Maierova, Lenka/0000-0002-7303-8232",,,"Acosta I, 2019, SOL ENERGY, V193, P584, DOI 10.1016/j.solener.2019.10.00; Astra SW, BUILD DES SOFT; Boyce PR, 2014, HUMAN FACTORS IN LIGHTING, 3RD EDITION, P; Cajochen C, 2007, SLEEP MED REV, V11, P453, DOI 10.1016/j.smrv.2007.07.00; French AN, 2013, EXP EYE RES, V114, P58, DOI 10.1016/j.exer.2013.04.01; Grzybowski A, 2020, BMC OPHTHALMOL, V20, DOI 10.1186/s12886-019-1220-; Heschong L., 2012, LM8312 IE; Heschong Mahone Group, 1999, DAYL SCH INV REL DA; Hobday R, 2016, PERSPECT PUBLIC HEAL, V136, P50, DOI 10.1177/175791391557667; Holden BA, 2016, OPHTHALMOLOGY, V123, P1036, DOI 10.1016/j.ophtha.2016.01.00; Jakubiec JA, 2012, LIGHTING RES TECHNOL, V44, P149, DOI 10.1177/147715351142009; Klaver CCW, 2021, JAMA OPHTHALMOL, V139, P300, DOI 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.623; Light Foundry LLC, LIGHTSTANZA SOFT; Nicklas M.H., 1996, ANAL PERFORMANCE ST; Sherwin JC, 2012, OPHTHALMOLOGY, V119, P2141, DOI 10.1016/j.ophtha.2012.04.02; Thiry J-D.B.M.G., 2019, TYPOLOGIE ECOLES PRI, V",16,0,0,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12134,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012134,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100134,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.0032773453502662844,1.7229123365367182e-12,0.021402741029000718,0.07571339950372208,0.020897506633672645

A hardware controller and its digital twin are tested in real-time in a separate platform in the cloud, and the results are analyzed to determine what insights can tests on virtual controllers give about the behaviors of their real-life hardware counter-parts. Key performance indicators (KPIs) from literature are used to evaluate the control. It is shown that although the controllers differ in their control output time-series, their overall performance profile along the entire simulation run follows a similar pattern (KPI percent error varies between 3% and 8%). This implies that virtual controller testing can be a good indicator of hardware controller behavior.","[Maghnie, M.; Stegemerten, F.; Kuempel, A.; Mueller, D.] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Mathieustr 10, D-52072 Aachen, Germany; [Niewoehner, A.; Baranski, M.] Aedifion GmbH, Hohenzollernring 72, D-50672 Cologne, Germany","Maghnie, M (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Mathieustr 10, D-52072 Aachen, Germany.",marwa.maghnie@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,"Maghnie, Marwa/AAE-5311-2022","Maghnie, Marwa/0000-0001-6130-0072",BMWi (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy) [03EN1014A],"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the BMWi (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy), promotional reference 03EN1014A.

The generated luminance maps using Python scripts with OpenCV packages were further processed to extract daylighting and glare metrics using Evalgare. The results showed that: (i) among the different camera resolutions that were compared, the 330x330 resolution was selected as the best option to balance between accurate capturing of visual environment and comfort and computational efficiency; (ii) a camera sensor embedded on the rear side of a computer screen could capture interior visual conditions consistently similarly to those viewed by the occupant, except for sunny conditions without proper shading protection.

This study investigates the impact of changing urban climate on indoor temperatures by focusing on three Venice morphological patterns. Through microclimate modelling techniques, outdoor and indoor temperatures are simulated in 2020 and 2050 scenarios. Results show that the compactness of the urban fabric contributes to reducing indoor building temperatures. The analysis suggests that the increased density of shadow areas can mitigate the outdoor temperature values and reduce direct radiation on facades. When comparing the two climate scenarios 2020 and 2050, average indoor temperatures increase in the latter. However, the analysis highlights that the absence of insulation and the relatively high thermal mass of typical Venetian envelopes plays a crucial role in the building thermal processes preserving indoor comfort in a warmer climate future.","[Maiullari, D.] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Urbanism, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands; [Gherri, B.; Finizza, C.; Maretto, M.; Naboni, E.] Univ Parma, Dept Engn & Architecture DIA, Parco Area Sci 181A, I-43124 Parma, Italy; [Naboni, E.] Royal Danish Acad Fine Arts, Inst Architecture & Technol, Sch Architecture Design & Conservat, Philip de Langes 10, DK-1435 Copenhagen K, Denmark","Maiullari, D (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Dept Urbanism, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.",,,,,,"Berghauser Pont M., 2010, SPACEMATRIX SPACE D; Caniggia G, 1986, CASA VENEZIANA NELLA, P; Ghaffarianhoseini A, 2017, SIMAUD 17, P27; Helge S, 2017, EVALUATION ENVI MET; Huttner S, NUMERICAL MODELING U, P; Javanroodi K, 2020, URBAN CLIM, V31, DOI 10.1016/j.uclim.2019.10054; Li XM, 2019, ENERGY, V174, P407, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2019.02.18; Maretto M., 2001, P INT SEM URB FORM I, P12; Morganti M, 2017, ENRGY PROCED, V134, P807, DOI 10.1016/j.egypro.2017.09.53; Muratori S., 1960, STUDI OPERANTE STORI, P2; Remund J., 2010, P 10 EMS ANN M 10 E; Salvati A, 2019, ENERG BUILDINGS, V185, P162, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.12.02; Santamouris M, 2015, ENERG BUILDINGS, V98, P119, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.09.05; Stewart ID, 2012, B AM METEOROL SOC, V93, P1879, DOI 10.1175/BAMS-D-11-00019.; Wang B, 2017, RENEW ENERG, V113, P989, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2017.06.05",15,0,0,1,2,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12060,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012060,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100060,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.0030725112658746417,1.9495912776325532e-08,0.014303085221593376,0.10945697502354154,0.014287526835817797

The subjects in this study were students of grade 10 in a public high school in Riau. Data is collected by giving problems of application of parabolic motion in everyday life. Students' answers on answer sheets and recorded conversations of students are then analyzed using a rubric of CPS skills. The results showed that CPS skills of students in social skills and cognitive skills are still dominated in the low and middle categories.

According to our previous investigations, it is possible to induce chirality in an amorphous azopolymer with a high linear photoanisotropy by illumination with elliptically polarized light. In the present work, we studied the photoinduced chirality in thin nanocomposite films based on the azopolymer poly[1-[ 4-(3-carboxy-4-hydroxyphenylazo)benzenesulfonamido]-1,2-ethanediyl, sodium salt], shortly PAZO, doped with TiO2 nanoparticles with a size of about 20 nm. The thickness of the prepared films was approximately 550 nm and the concentration of the nanoparticles varied from 0 to 3 wt. %. A He-Cd laser beam (lambda = 442 nm) was used, with the input ellipticity varying from -1 (left circularly polarized) to +1 (right circularly polarized). The ellipticity was set using a quarterwave and a half-wave plates. We studied the dependences of the output ellipticity and the angle of self-rotation of the polarization azimuth on the input ellipticity. Based on the experimental data obtained, we could analyze the dependence of the self-rotation of the polarization azimuth on the concentration of the nanoparticles. The results show that small concentrations of nanoparticles lead to an enhancement of the self-rotation, hence, the chirality.","[Mateev, G.; Nedelchev, L.; Nazarova, D.; Blagoeva, B.; Berberova-Buhova, N.; Stoykova, E.] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Opt Mat & Technol, Acad G Bonchev Str,Bl 109, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria; [Nedelchev, L.] Univ Telecommun & Post, 1 Acad Stefan Mladenov Str, Sofia 1700, Bulgaria","Mateev, G (corresponding author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Opt Mat & Technol, Acad G Bonchev Str,Bl 109, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria.",g_mateev@iomt.bas.bg,,,National Science Fund of Bulgaria [KP-06-N38/15]; Bulgarian Ministry of Education and Science [D01-284/17.12.2019],"This work was financially supported by contract KP-06-N38/15 with the National Science Fund of Bulgaria.

Factors like current electricity price, grid code compliance, and maintenance costs will affect operational decision. Therefore, it is expected that plant control strategies will trade different control objectives while respecting the industrial practice, where the different levels in the hierarchy may be provided by different equipment vendors. This work proposes a plant controller that aims to track an operator power command at the WPP level and to reject low-frequency loading due to turbulent winds at individual turbines. The plant control respects the hierarchy in which the turbine-level controller takes precedence, interacting only via power set-point commands to each turbine. The control algorithm is based on parallel control loops along with look-up tables and gain scheduling, and its simplicity and effectiveness make it well-suited for industrial applications. Preliminary simulation results with a 32-turbine WPP indicate that there is a significant synergy effect by coordinating operation of the turbines in a plant. Structural loads can be reduced on certain turbines without excessively burdening the others, while an accurate plant-wide power tracking is still provided.","[Merz, Karl; Chabaud, Valentin; Garcia-Rosa, Paula B.; Kolle, Konstanze] SINTEF Energy Res, Sem Saelands Vei 11, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway","Merz, K (corresponding author), SINTEF Energy Res, Sem Saelands Vei 11, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway.",Karl.Merz@sintef.no,,,European Union [727680]; Norwegian Research Council [268044/E20],"This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement No. 727680, and the Norwegian Research Council and the industrial partners of OPWIND: Operational Control for Wind Power Plants (grant no. 268044/E20).","Andersen S J, 2018, REFERENCE WIND POWE; Bossanyi E, 2018, J PHYS CONF SER, V1037, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1037/3/03201; Bossanyi E, 2016, 2016 EUROPEAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ECC), P922, DOI 10.1109/ECC.2016.781040; Burton T., 2001, WIND ENERG; Christian H.

Adding Building Information Models (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to these temporal sources unleashes potential. We call this data convergence the Internet-of-Buildings or IoB. In this paper, a digital twin case study of data intersection from various systems is outlined. Initial insights are discussed for an experiment with 17 participants that focused on the collection of occupant subjective feedback to characterize indoor comfort.

Data were analyzed by coding which were then grouped into themes. In this study, the researcher find that the teacher has actually applied chemical representations in chemistry learning, but the teacher is not yet familiar with the term of multiple representations in chemistry. Then, representations level that are often applied by teachers in learning chemistry are symbolic and macroscopic representations. Meanwhile, submicroscopic representations are still difficult to apply by teachers in chemistry learning process.","[Mindayula, E.; Sutrisno, H.] Univ Negeri Yogyakarta, Grad Sch, Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia","Mindayula, E (corresponding author), Univ Negeri Yogyakarta, Grad Sch, Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia.",mindayula@gmail.com,,,,,"Akaygun S, 2016, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V17, P788, DOI 10.1039/c6rp00067; Ardac D, 2004, J RES SCI TEACH, V41, P317, DOI 10.1002/tea.2000; Barnea N., 1999, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V8, P25; Bunce DM, 2002, J RES SCI TEACH, V39, P911, DOI 10.1002/tea.1005; Chittleborough G, 2007, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V8, P27; Creswell J., 2012, ED RES PLANNING CON; Creswell J.W, 2009, RES DEFIGN QUALITAT; Creswell JW., 2018, QUALITATIVE INQUIRY, V4th, P38; Devetak I, 2010, INT J SCI EDUC, V32, P1561, DOI 10.1080/0950069090315060; Gilbert JK, 2009, MODEL MODEL SCI EDUC, V4, P1, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4020-8872-; Jaber LZ, 2012, INT J SCI EDUC, V34, P973, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2011.56995; Johnstone A.

The surface properties of the PS obtained by both methods have been examined using the capillary wave method, which was previously modified by the authors specifically for biomedical applications. Significant difference was found in the results obtained with ESAT and BAL in the group of healthy subjects, which can be explained by different origin of the samples obtained by these techniques. Furthermore, significant difference in surface properties was established in the samples collected from healthy volunteers and patient with disseminated tuberculosis, while we did not find significant differences in the limited inflammatory process. The results presented in the paper demonstrate high potential of the proposed non-invasive technique for clinical usage.","[Mizev, A.; Shmyrov, A.; Shmyrova, A.; Mizeva, I] Inst Continuous Media Mech, Ak Koroleva 1, Perm 614013, Russia; [Pshenichnikova-Peleneva, I] Perm State Med Univ, Petropavlovskaya St 26, Perm 614065, Russia","Mizev, A (corresponding author), Inst Continuous Media Mech, Ak Koroleva 1, Perm 614013, Russia.",alex_mizev@icmm.ru,"Shmyrov, Andrey/AAB-5835-2022",,"Ministry of Science and High Education of Russia [121031700169-1, AAA-A19-119012290101-5]",The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support provided by the Ministry of Science and High Education of Russia (theme no. 121031700169-1 and AAA-A19-119012290101-5).,"Almstrand AC, 2009, ANAL CHEM, V81, P662, DOI 10.1021/ac802055; Amann A, 2013, VOLATILE BIOMARKERS: NON-INVASIVE DIAGNOSIS IN PHYSIOLOGY AND MEDICINE, pXXVI; Bake B, 2017, J AEROSOL MED PULM D, V30, P267, DOI 10.1089/jamp.2016.133; Chroneos ZC, 2009, TUBERCULOSIS, V89, pS10, DOI 10.1016/S1472-9792(09)70005-; Clements J, 1961, ARMY CHEM RES DEV LA, V3052, P; FAIRCHILD CI, 1987, AM IND HYG ASSOC J, V48, P948, DOI 10.1080/1529866879138586; Haslbeck K, 2010, J AEROSOL SCI, V41, P429, DOI 10.1016/j.jaerosci.2010.02.01; Horvath I, 2003, EUR RESPIR J, V22, P187, DOI 10.1183/09031936.03.0001170; Johnson GR, 2011, J AEROSOL SCI, V42, P839, DOI 10.1016/j.jaerosci.2011.07.00; Johnson GR, 2009, J AEROSOL MED PULM D, V22, P229, DOI 10.1089/jamp.2008.072; Meyer KC, 2007, SEMIN RESP CRIT CARE, V28, P546, DOI 10.1055/s-2007-99152; Morawska L, 2009, J AEROSOL SCI, V40, P256, DOI 10.1016/j.jaerosci.2008.11.00; Morozov VN, 2017, J BREATH RES, V11, DOI 10.1088/1752-7163/aa535; Papineni RS, 1996, J AEROSOL MED, V10, P105, DOI 10.1089/jam.1997.10.10; Pardon G, 2015, SENSOR ACTUAT B-CHEM, V212, P344, DOI 10.1016/j.snb.2015.02.00; Raghavendran K, 2011, CRIT CARE CLIN, V27, P525, DOI 10.1016/j.ccc.2011.04.00; Schwab U, 2009, MICROB PATHOGENESIS, V46, P185, DOI 10.1016/j.micpath.2008.12.00; Schwarz K, 2015, J AEROSOL MED PULM D, V28, P52, DOI 10.1089/jamp.2013.110; Schwarz K, 2010, J AEROSOL MED PULM D, V23, P371, DOI 10.1089/jamp.2009.080; Shmyrov A, 2021, J AEROSOL SCI, V151, DOI 10.1016/j.jaerosci.2020.10562; Shmyrov A, 2019, PHYS FLUIDS, V31, DOI 10.1063/1.506066; Tinglev AD, 2016, J BREATH RES, V10, DOI 10.1088/1752-7155/10/2/02600; Ullah S, 2015, ANAL CHEM, V87, P11553, DOI 10.1021/acs.analchem.5b0343; VOGEL V, 1989, LANGMUIR, V5, P129, DOI 10.1021/la00085a02; WALTERS EH, 1991, THORAX, V46, P613, DOI 10.1136/thx.46.9.61; Wang ZD, 2008, TUBERCULOSIS, V88, P178, DOI 10.1016/j.tube.2007.11.00; Wurie FB, 2016, THORAX, V71, P549, DOI 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2015-20729; Yang C., J PHYS C SERIES, V202",28,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1945.0,,,,,,,,12035,10.1088/1742-6596/1945/1/012035,,6,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Mechanics",Materials Science; Mechanics,BS4HU,WOS:000719382600035,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.005735354362965997,9.873164254697668e-09,0.010624122726657106,0.08398417340443833,0.010624122726657106

The geometrical properties of capillary waves are extremely useful in the characterization of surfaceparameters. In Shmyrov et al 2019, the modified capillary wave technique was successfully used to perform experiments, to register surface profiles and to realize data processing, yet the algorithm for semi-manual data processing proposed by the authors is labor-intensive and time-consuming. It appears that the analysis of the data is compex because of specific geometry problems, presence of noise at different scales, and data gaps. In this study, the algorithm for analysis of a surface instantaneous profiles formed due to capillary waves propogating is proposed. It was found that the noise and the useful signal have different scales. Moreover, the structure of the useful signal is defined, and therefore it becomes possible to study the noise part of the signal and the patterns of the useful signals. On the basis of the preliminary knowledge about the signal structure, the algorithm has been developed to overcome the above mentioned problems. The proposed method has been tested on the set of semi-synthetic data and provides a reliable result.","[Mizeva, I] Inst Continuous Media Mech, Ak Koroleva 1, Perm 614013, Russia","Mizeva, I (corresponding author), Inst Continuous Media Mech, Ak Koroleva 1, Perm 614013, Russia.",mizeva@icmm.ru,,,RFBR [20-01-00648-a]; Ministry of Science and High Education of Russia [AAA-A19-119012290101-5],"The research is supported by the RFBR (project 20-01-00648-a), experimental part, and Ministry of Science and High Education of Russia (theme No. AAA-A19-119012290101-5 for the algorithm development).

Here we develop a methodology using a Random Forests algorithm (in combination with GIS spatial data processing) to detect and classify the residential neighbourhoods and their spatial characteristics within the region between Oxford and Cambridge, that is, the 'Oxford-Cambridge Arc'. The classification model is based on four pre-defined urban classes, that is, Centre, Urban, Suburban, and Rural for the entire region. The resolution is a grid of 500 m x 500 m. The features for classification include (1) dwelling geometric attributes (e.g. garden size, building footprint area, building perimeter), (2) street networks (e.g. street length, street density, street connectivity), (3) dwelling density (number of housing units per hectare), (4) building residential types (detached, semi-detached, terraced, and flats), and (5) characteristics of the surrounding neighbourhoods. The classification results, with overall average accuracy of 80% (accuracy per class: Centre: 38%, Urban 91%, Suburban 83%, and Rural 77%), for the Arc region show that the most important variables were three characteristics of the surrounding area: residential footprint area, dwelling density, and number of private gardens. The results of the classification are used to establish a baseline for the current status of the residential neighbourhoods in the Arc region. The results bring data-driven decision-making processes to the level of local authority and policy makers in order to support sustainable housing development at the regional scale.","[Mohajeri, N.] UCL, Inst Environm Design & Engn, London, England; [Walch, A.; Assouline, D.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Gudmundsson, A.] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Earth Sci, London, England; [Smith, A.; Russel, T.; Hall, J.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England","Mohajeri, N (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Environm Design & Engn, London, England.",,,"Mohajeri, Nahid/0000-0002-7339-5109","Alan Turing Institute, UKRI Strategic Priorities Fund programme on AI for Science",The research described in this paper was funded by the Alan Turing Institute as part of the UKRI Strategic Priorities Fund programme on AI for Science and the Government.,"5th Studio, 2017, FIN REP CAMBR MILT ; Breiman L, 2001, MACH LEARN, V45, P5, DOI 10.1023/A:101093340432; Breiman L, 1996, MACH LEARN, V24, P123, DOI 10.1007/bf0005865; Computer Springer, URB MORPH M DEEP LEA, DOI [10.1007/978-3-319-95168-3_20, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-95168-3_20; Hargreaves AJ, 2015, COMPUT ENVIRON URBAN, V54, P280, DOI 10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2015.08.00; Hecht R., 2013, 26 INT CART C, P; Hussain M, 2018, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V10962, P300, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-95168-3_2; Moosavi V, 2017, URBAN MORPHOLOGY MEE, DOI [10.1007/978-3-319-95168_20, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-95168_20; Reades J, 2019, URBAN STUD, V56, P922, DOI 10.1177/004209801878905; Sarkar C, 2017, LANCET PLANET HEALTH, V1, pE277, DOI 10.1016/S2542-5196(17)30119-; Schirmer PM, 2016, J TRANSP LAND USE, V9, P101, DOI 10.5198/jtlu.2015.66",11,0,0,4,6,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12017,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012017,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100017,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-07-14,0.0022531749283080703,6.045023556795057e-11,0.004092904784002647,0.08659406151335627,0.004092904784002647

Indeed, the more intensive data collection is expected to allow for load prediction, customer profiling, etc. In this context, our work aims at a better understanding of customer profiles from the captured data. Given the variety of households, such profiles are difficult to capture. This study explores the possibility to predict domestic hot water (DHW) usage. Such prediction is made challenging due to the presence of two components in the signal, the first one bound to the physical properties of the DHW distribution system, the second one bound to the human patterns related to DHW consumption. Our contributions include (1) the analysis of recurrent neural network architectures based on GRU, (2) the inclusion of state-based labels inferred in an unsupervised way to simulate domain knowledge, (3) the comparison of different features. Results show that the physical contribution in the signal can be forecasted successfully across households. On the contrary, the stochastic human component is harder to predict and would need further research, either by improving the modelling or by including alternate signals.","[Montet, Frederic; Rychener, Lorenz; Hennebert, Jean] HEIA FR, iCoSys Inst, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Pongelli, Alessandro; Bacher, Jean-Philippe] HEIA FR, ENERGY Inst, Fribourg, Switzerland","Montet, F (corresponding author), HEIA FR, iCoSys Inst, Fribourg, Switzerland.",frederic.montet@hefr.ch; lorenz.rychener@hefr.ch; alessandro.pongelli@hefr.ch; jean.hennebert@hefr.ch; jean-philippe.bacher@hefr.ch,,"Montet, Frederic/0000-0003-0439-5559",,,"[Anonymous], 1929, CUMULUS WATER HEATE; Cabeza L F, WOODHEAD PUBLISHING, Vsecond, P3; Cho K., 2014, ARXIV14061078, P1724, DOI DOI 10.3115/V1/D14-117; Cohen M, 2020, END TO END DEEP MET; Connolly D, 2014, ENERG POLICY, V65, P475, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2013.10.03; de Santiago J, 2017, ENERG BUILDINGS, V141, P341, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.02.04; Fuentes E, 2018, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V81, P1530, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.22; Hochreiter S, 1997, NEURAL COMPUT, V9, P1735, DOI 10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.173; Lund H, 2014, ENERGY, V68, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2014.02.08; Manokar A M, 2021, ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R, P; Mostafavi N, 2018, ENERG BUILDINGS, V158, P1683, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.12.00; Rathnayaka K, 2017, RESOUR CONSERV RECY, V118, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.resconrec.2016.11.01; ROUSSEEUW PJ, 1987, J COMPUT APPL MATH, V20, P53, DOI 10.1016/0377-0427(87)90125-; Shahmohammadi S, 2019, J IND ECOL, V23, P1186, DOI 10.1111/jiec.1285; Widen J, 2009, ENERG BUILDINGS, V41, P753, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2009.02.01; Willis RM, 2013, J CLEAN PROD, V60, P107, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2011.08.00",16,0,0,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12026,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012026,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100026,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-07-14,0.0032773453502662844,7.12228295484226e-07,0.014684853885439457,0.11993907232704402,0.014684853885439457

Respondents consisted of 40 boys and 30 girls with an average age of 15 years old. The instrument used was a written test consisting of 30 simple multiple-choice questions for three aspects of scientific literacy, which were scientific knowledge, scientific competencies, and attitudes toward science. The data analysis used Rasch Analysis Model (RAM) and assisted by Winsteps 4.4.5. The results being discussed are the person and item reliability, variable maps, and differential item functioning (DIF). The results show that the average scientific literacy ability of students falls into the low category, and some questions have gender biases.

Besides, it can also improve students' entrepreneurship skills. The learning process online trading arithmetic uses several market place applications such as Shopee, Bukalapak, and Tokopedia in which many online sellers offering the same item at different price. In addition, there are many possibilities to change the price of an item so students are interested in getting the best price for maximum profit. This research aimed to determine the differences of students' level of creative thinking in solving mathematics Higher Arithmetic Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) problems after the learning of online trading arithmetic. This research employed a descriptive method with a qualitative approach The research subjects were junior high school students consisting of 20 students which was divided into two groups; the control and experimental groups. The control group received regular arithmetic learning (control class) while the experimental group received online trading arithmetic (experimental class). The results of this research indicated that: (1) the level of students' creative thinking skills in solving mathematics HOTS questions in the experimental group showed the majority of students are in the creative category, while in the control group was less creative; (2) the metacognitive level of the majority of students at MTs Miftahul Huda Muncar Banyuwangi was at level 3 (aware use) for the experimental group while it was at level 2 (aware use) for the control group; (2) the result of statistical analysis showed the significance value of Sig.

Therefore, introducing physics from an early age is a necessity. This paper wants to uncover various thoughts about efforts to introduce physics to early childhood. The method used is a Focus Group Discussion (FGD), which involves experts from physics education, linguists, management, and early education. There are several important points that became the result of the FGD, including (1) physics logic must be made simpler that is easy to understand (2) Mathematical formula which becomes a symbol language does not need to be introduced first. Language skills are needed to understand physics and communicate it (3) Through the right approach, method and media, learning that is delivered by the teacher will make early childhood more literate with physics. This research concludes that physics is possible to be taught in early childhood. We, therefore, recommend that early childhood teachers collaborate with physics teachers in planning, implementing, and evaluating physics learning.","[Nasrudin, D.] UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung, Dept Phys Educ, Jl AH Nasut 105, Bandung, Indonesia; [Fitriyanti, N.] Telkom Univ, Dept Phys Engn, Jl Telekomunikasi 1, Bandung, Indonesia; [Muhtar, S.

For that reason, wind turbine wakes have been studied intensively and different engineering wake models were derived. However, none of them is constructed from a few basic and robust assumptions, while such a formalism already exists for the axisymmetric turbulent wake. Therefore, we will apply these models to data obtained in a wind farm using a scanning LiDAR. The wakes of two wind turbines are analyzed in four different wind directions chosen so that their wakes will have different degrees of interaction. The axisymmetric wake models are found to perform better than the Jensen wake model, and the main source of improvement is shown to be the presence of a virtual origin. Indeed, a virtual origin is shown to also improve the Jensen wake model significantly. Overall, our results indicate that a view from classical axisymmetric wake theory can help to improve the understanding of the evolution of wind turbine wakes in the atmospheric boundary layer.","[Neunaber, Ingrid; Aubrun, Sandrine] Cent Nantes, CNRS, LHEEA, 1 Rue Noe, F-44300 Nantes, France; [Obligado, Martin] Grenoble INP, CNRS, LEGI, 46 Ave Felix Viallet, F-38031 Grenoble, France; [Peinke, Joachim] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Phys & ForWind, Kupkersweg 70, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany","Neunaber, I (corresponding author), Cent Nantes, CNRS, LHEEA, 1 Rue Noe, F-44300 Nantes, France.",ingrid.neunaber@ec-nantes.fr,"Peinke, Joachim/AAB-9194-2021","Peinke, Joachim/0000-0002-0775-7423", [ANR-14-CE050034];  [ANR-19-CE05-0034],"The data presented here was accumulated within the SMARTEOLE project (ANR-14-CE050034), and it is evaluated further within the MOMENTA project (ANR-19-CE05-0034).","Barthelmie RJ, 2006, J ATMOS OCEAN TECH, V23, P888, DOI 10.1175/JTECH1886.; Bastankhah M, 2014, RENEW ENERG, V70, P116, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2014.01.00; Dairay T, 2015, J FLUID MECH, V781, P166, DOI 10.1017/jfm.2015.49; Garcia ET, 2019, RENEW ENERG, V130, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2018.06.03; George W.K., 1989, ADV TURBUL, V3973, P3; Go~cmen T, 2016, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, P6; Hegazy A, 2020, THESIS ECOLE CTR NA; Hinze JO, 1975, TURBULENC; Jensen NO., 1983, NOTE WIND GENERATO; Nedic J, 2013, PHYS REV LETT, V111, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.14450; Neunaber I, 2021, WIND ENERGY SCI DIS; Obligado M, 2016, PHYS REV FLUIDS, V1, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevFluids.1.04440; Okulov VL, 2015, J PHYS CONF SER, V625, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/625/1/01201; Porte-Agel F, 2020, BOUND-LAY METEOROL, V174, P1, DOI 10.1007/s10546-019-00473-; Stein VP, 2019, ENERGIES, V12, DOI 10.3390/en1214276; Tennekes J.L., 1972, 1 COURSE TURBULENC; Townsend A.

Multicomponent films containing ZnO, TiO2, and Ag, are thus deposited on a substrate. The as-prepared composite films are then immersed in double distiled water and irradiated by nanosecond laser pulses. This results in the production of colloids composed by multicomponent nanoparticles. The optical properties of the colloids are evaluated by optical transmittance measurements in the UV-VIS spectral range. Transmission electron microscopy is used to visualize the nanostructures formed in the solution, as well as to evaluate their size distribution.

Wind spectra obtained from the two LES solvers agree well with the empirical spectral model near the surface but show lower turbulence intensity in the low frequency range above the surface layer. Both models also produce highly consistent estimates of coherence with different horizontal and vertical separations, which match well with Davenport and IEC coherence models at height of 180m and 140m respectively. As the height decreases, LES predicts lower vertical coherence compared with the IEC model and the fitted decay coefficient for Davenport model grows as the separation distance increases.","[Ning, X.] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; Bergen Offshore Wind Ctr, Bergen, Norway","Ning, X (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway.",Xu.Ning@uib.no,,,University of Bergen; Equinor,This work is part of the LES-WIND project and the authors would like to acknowledge the funding from the academic agreement between University of Bergen and Equinor.

The widely used Mann spectral tensor model with inputs recommended by the standard, is compared to FitMann, the Mann model with inputs fitted to measurements and TIMESR; using measured time series combined with the Davenport coherence model. The Mann model produces too low energy levels at the lowest frequencies of the wind spectra, while the wind spectra generated by FitMann approaches the measured values. TIMESR reproduces the measured spectral values at all frequencies. The different models give similar vertical coherence, while the Mann and FitMann models give lower horizontal coherence than TIMESR. Investigating the wind loads on a bottom-fixed 10-MW wind turbine, the spectra for the tower bottom fore-aft and blade root flapwise bending moment follow the shape of the wind spectra closely at low frequencies. The low-frequency range is important for the blade root and in particular the tower bottom bending moment. Thus, the TIMESR model, followed by FitMann, is assumed to give the most accurate fatigue estimates. For the specific situation analysed in this study, the FitMann model gives only 18 and 5 % lower estimates than TIMESR of the tower bottom and blade root damage equivalent bending moments, while the Mann model gives 27 % and 12 % lower estimates. The tower top yaw and fore-aft bending moments depend on the wind coherence. For the specific situation analysed in this study, the FitMann model gives 9 and 5 % higher estimates of the tower top yaw and tower top damage equivalent (bending) moments compared to TIMESR, while the Mann model gives 23 % and 18 % higher estimates. Since only measurements of the vertical coherence are available, it is not clear which model is superior for the tower top moments. However, the importance of a proper coherence model is documented.","[Nybo, A.; Nielsen, F. G.; Godvik, M.] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Nybo, A.; Nielsen, F.

In this study, a basic geometry of a semi-submersible floater for 10MW is designed, based on which sensitivity study of the material property on floater design is conducted. It was found that minimum floater pitch angles achieved by selecting the optimum floater geometries were similar for the three types of material, while larger values of geometrical variables were required for concrete floaters than for steel floaters for a floater pitch limitation If larger wall thickness was to be required for concrete structures due to, for example, corrosion protection and crack limitation, generally larger side column width and lower hull length were required for concrete floaters. As the sensitivity of pitch angle to the wall thickness was more affected by wind excitation than wave excitation for normal concrete, it is indicated that the design space for the length of hull can be widened by combining the design with the wind turbine controller methods in the treatment of the maximum thrust force. Lightweight concrete had advantages over normal concrete in the lower center of gravity. The raw material cost of lightweight concrete was higher than normal concrete but significantly lower than steel floaters.","[Oh, Sho] ClassNK, Chiyoda Ku, 4-7 Kioicho, Tokyo, Japan","Oh, S (corresponding author), ClassNK, Chiyoda Ku, 4-7 Kioicho, Tokyo, Japan.",s-oh@classnk.or.jp,,,,,"[Anonymous], 2019, IEC614003; Architectural Institute of Japan, 2018, STAND STRUCT CALC R; Architectural Institute of Japan, 2016, STAND STRUCT DES CO; Campos A, 2016, P I CIVIL ENG-MAR EN, V169, P49, DOI 10.1680/jmaen.2014.2; Christian H.

The objective of this paper is to shed light on design parameters for cost-effective and low-footprint mooring configurations for FOWTs using coupled dynamic analyses. A design space is explored for mooring configurations with different pretension ratios, laid down length ratios and clump weight sizes. Ultimate and fatigue load cases are simulated in Open-Fast to compute the floater motions, mooring line tensions and fatigue damage. With constant pretension ratio of 0.15 and adding clump weights of 40t, mooring line length, mooring footprint and peak tension can be reduced by 14%, 15% and 9% respectively, while maximum surge and fatigue damage increase by 25% and 12% respectively.

The results of data analysis show that students with high mathematical abilities in solving contextual problems involve their metacognitive skills.","[Pathuddin; Bennu, S.] Tadulako Univ, Fac Teacher Training & Educ, Math & Sci Div, Math Study Program, Jl Soekarno Hatta Km 9, Palu 94118, Indonesia","Pathuddin (corresponding author), Tadulako Univ, Fac Teacher Training & Educ, Math & Sci Div, Math Study Program, Jl Soekarno Hatta Km 9, Palu 94118, Indonesia.",pathuddin@untad.ac.id,,"Bennu, Sudarman/0000-0003-1093-7668; , Pathuddin/0000-0002-8837-8897","Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Tadulako University","The author would like to thank the Dean of the Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Tadulako University, through funding the Tadulako University budget implementation checklist.","[Anonymous], 1992, METACOGNITION CORE ; Davis EJ., 1975, DYNAMICS TEACHING 2 DYNAMICS TEACHING ; De Corte, 2003, P INT C MATH ED 21 ; Gama CA, 2004, THESIS U SUSSEX THESIS U SUSSE; Gartman S, 1993, MATH ED, V6, P; Gladding GE, 2020, PHYS ED RES, V16, P; Hudojo H., 2003, CURRICULUM DEV MAT; Lee M, 2006, EDUC TECHNOL SOC, V9, P34; Livingston Jeniffer A, 1997, METACOGNITION OVERV; Meijer J, 2013, EDUC RES-UK, V55, P31, DOI 10.1080/00131881.2013.76702; Miles M.B., 2020, QUALITATIVE DATA ANA, V4t; Muhtarom Sutrisno, 2020, UNIVERSAL J ED RES, V8, P2100, DOI 10 13189/ujer 202; Naples AJ, 2003, PSYCHOL PROBLEM SOLV, P29; Panaoura A, 2001, YOUNG PUPILS METACOG YOUNG PUPILS METACO; Pathuddin, 2019, J PHYS CONF SER, V1218, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1218/1/01202; Pathuddin Budayasa IK, 2018, J PHYS C SERIES, V110; Pekhonen, 1997, PROBLEM SOLVING MAT; Pellegrino JW, 2014, PSICOL EDUC, V20, P65, DOI 10.1016/j.pse.2014.11.00; Polya G, 1973, SOLVE I; Sternberg RJ., 1984, EDUC RESEARCHER, V13, P5, DOI [10.3102/0013189X013001005, DOI 10.3102/0013189X013001005; Wellman LL, 2008, METACOGNITION READI",21,0,0,2,2,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1832.0,,,,,,,,12048,10.1088/1742-6596/1832/1/012048,,7,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Physics, Multidisciplinary",Mathematics; Physics,BS0UA,WOS:000684374700048,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.003216419053453821,1.0545824768367019e-25,0.006117596755350938,0.04964679223475199,0.006117596755350938

Recently, data-driven models are increasingly becoming popular in many branches of science and engineering due to their non-intrusive nature (i.e., they are equation-free) and online learning capability. Despite the robust performance of data-driven models, they are faced with challenges of poor generalizability and difficulty in interpretation. These challenges have encouraged the integration of physics-based models with data-driven models, herein denoted hybrid analysis and modeling (HAM). We propose two different frameworks under the HAM paradigm for applications relevant to wind energy in order to bring the physical realism within emerging digital twin technologies. The physics-guided machine learning (PGML) framework reduces the uncertainty of neural network predictions by embedding physics-based features from a simplified model at intermediate layers and its performance is demonstrated for the aerodynamic force prediction task. Our results show that the proposed PGML framework achieves approximately 75% reduction in uncertainty for smaller angle of attacks. The interface learning (IL) framework illustrates how different solvers can be coupled to produce a multi-fidelity model and is successfully applied for the Boussinesq equations that govern a broad class of transport processes. The IL approach paves the way for seamless integration of multi-scale, multi-physics and multi-fidelity models (M-3 models).","[Pawar, Suraj; Ahmed, Shady E.; San, Omer] Oklahoma State Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Rasheed, Adil] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Engn Cybernet, N-7465 Trondheim, Norway","Pawar, S (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",supawar@okstate.edu; shady.ahmed@okstate.edu; osan@okstate.edu; adil.rasheed@ntnu.no,"Pawar, Suraj/AAY-8109-2021","Pawar, Suraj/0000-0001-7562-799X",Department of Engineering Norwegian Research Council [268044/E20]; U.S. DOE Early Career Research Program [DE-SC0019290]; National Science Foundation [DMS-2012255],"The authors acknowledge the financial support from the Department of Engineering Norwegian Research Council, the industrial partners of OPWIND: Operational Control for Wind Power Plants (Grant No.: 268044/E20), the U.S. DOE Early Career Research Program (Award Number DE-SC0019290), and the National Science Foundation under Award Number DMS-2012255.","Ahmed SE, 2021, PLOS ONE, V16, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.024609; Ahmed SE, 2020, PHYS REV E, V102, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevE.102.05330; Ahmed SE, 2020, PHYSICA D, V409, DOI 10.1016/j.physd.2020.13247; [Anonymous], 2000, FLUIDS 200 C EX; Barter GE, 2020, RENEW ENERG FOCUS, V34, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.ref.2020.03.00; Bastankhah M, 2014, RENEW ENERG, V70, P116, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2014.01.00; Bhatnagar S, 2019, COMPUT MECH, V64, P525, DOI 10.1007/s00466-019-01740-; Drela M., 1989, LOW REYNOLDS NUMBER, P; HESS JL, 1990, ANNU REV FLUID MECH, V22, P25; Holmes P, 2012, CAMB MG MEC, P1, DOI 10.1017/CBO978051191970; Lakshminarayanan B., 2017, P ADV NEUR INF PROC, P6402, DOI DOI 10.5555/3295222.329538; Maulik R, 2020, PHYS REV FLUIDS, V5, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevFluids.5.10440; Meneveau C, 2019, J TURBUL, V20, P2, DOI 10.1080/14685248.2019.158466; Pawar S, 2021, PHYS FLUIDS, V33, DOI 10.1063/5.003892; Pawar S, 2020, PHYS FLUIDS, V32, DOI 10.1063/5.002467; Politis ES, 2012, WIND ENERGY, V15, P161, DOI 10.1002/we.48; Rasheed A, 2020, IEEE ACCESS, V8, P21980, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.297014; Schlez Wolfgang, 2009, EUR WIND EN C, P; Shapiro CR, 2018, J FLUID MECH, V841, DOI 10.1017/jfm.2018.7; Tibshirani R, 1996, NEURAL COMPUT, V8, P152, DOI 10.1162/neco.1996.8.1.15; Veers P, 2019, SCIENCE, V366, P443, DOI 10.1126/science.aau202; Zha GC, 2007, AIAA J, V45, P2087, DOI 10.2514/1.2092; Zhang Y., 2018, 20181903 AIAA, P190; Zhu YH, 2019, J COMPUT PHYS, V394, P56, DOI 10.1016/j.jcp.2019.05.02",24,0,0,8,10,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2018.0,,,,,,,,12031,10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/012031,,10,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Mechanical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BS3LW,WOS:000713005900031,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-07-14,0.004916018025399427,0.00021480195164152083,0.011186859029310223,0.11436469265367316,0.011136343830205139

However, their accuracy both to reproduce the wind speed and turbulent kinetic energy fields behind turbines is a matter of debate. Here, and to the authors knowledge for the first time for a single turbine, the inbuilt wind farm parametrization of the Weather Research and Forecasting model is evaluated using detailed large-eddy simulations of the wake performed with a generalized actuator disk model that was implemented in the same modeling system. Thus, a fairer evaluation is achieved compared to previous works, as we try to set the simulations as similar as possible within the same modeling framework. We find that both types of simulations can be used to provide similar inflow conditions to the turbine. Most importantly, by comparing the detailed-wake results, within the area where the turbine is placed, with the mesoscale results at the analogous position, velocity deficits can differ up to 50%. However, within the same area, the vertical profile of turbine-generated TKE is nearly identical between the two types of simulations. Our findings demonstrate that the generalized actuator disk implementation can provide us with a solid foundation for evaluation of wind farm parametrizations within weather models.","[Pena, Alfredo] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Wind Energy, Roskilde, Denmark; [Mirocha, Jeffrey D.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA","Pena, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Wind Energy, Roskilde, Denmark.",aldi@dtu.dk,,"Pena Diaz, Alfredo/0000-0002-7900-9651; Mirocha, Jeffrey/0000-0001-5914-6168",Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark,This work is partly funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark and administered by Danida Fellowship Centre through the 'Multi-scale and model-chain Evaluation of Wind Atlases' (MEWA) project.,"Archer CL, 2020, MON WEATHER REV, V148, P4823, DOI 10.1175/MWR-D-20-0097.; Bak C, 2013, I0092 DTU WIND EN ; DEARDORFF JW, 1980, BOUND-LAY METEOROL, V18, P495, DOI 10.1007/BF0011950; Feroz RMA, 2020, SUSTAIN ENERGY TECHN, V42, DOI 10.1016/j.seta.2020.10088; Fitch AC, 2012, MON WEATHER REV, V140, P3017, DOI 10.1175/MWR-D-11-00352.; Mirocha JD, 2014, J RENEW SUSTAIN ENER, V6, DOI 10.1063/1.486106; Mirocha JD, 2018, WIND ENERGY SCI, V3, P589, DOI 10.5194/wes-3-589-201; Monin A.S., 1954, T GEOFIZ I SSSR, V151, pe18; Nakanishi M, 2009, J METEOROL SOC JPN, V87, P895, DOI 10.2151/jmsj.87.89; Pe~na A, 2021, WIND ENERG SCI DISC; Pena A, 2020, J PHYS CONF SER, V1618, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1618/6/06200; Tomaszewski J M., WIND ENERG SCI, V6, P; Volker PJH, 2015, GEOSCI MODEL DEV, V8, P3715, DOI 10.5194/gmd-8-3715-201",13,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1934.0,,,,,,,,12010,10.1088/1742-6596/1934/1/012010,,9,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Mechanical; Mechanics; Physics, Fluids & Plasmas",Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Mechanics; Physics,BS3JN,WOS:000712011500010,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-07-14,0.002662843097091356,0.00031345149709878094,0.0034743670449486146,0.11289427435019887,0.003361420368630754

A four degree-of-freedom frequency-domain model is used for the dynamic response of a spar floating wind turbine subjected to wind and wave loads. The framework allows for design optimization involving the geometrical properties of the floater and the mooring system and inclusion of long realizations of multiple load cases in the analysis. The adopted optimization approach adopted relies on analytical design sensitivities of the governing frequency-domain equations and of the design requirements. This ensures that modern gradient-based optimization algorithms can effectively be used to solve the design problem at hand. The optimization approach is applied to the design of the spar-buoy floater and its mooring system for the IEA 15 MW reference wind turbine. A post-processing approach for identifying discrete designs from predefined catalogues is also presented. The post-processing allows to transform continuous design solutions into practical ones that can be used in subsequent analyses with time domain response models for the full validation of the design solutions obtained. The numerical results highlight the capability of the approach discussed herein to provide discrete optimized designs for given design constraints and loads in few minutes requiring modest computational resources and time.,"[Pollini, Nicolo; Dou, Suguang; Stolpe, Mathias] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Pegalajar-Jurado, Antonio; Bredmose, Henrik] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Nils Koppels Alle, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark","Pollini, N (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Wind Energy, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",nipol@dtu.dk; ampj@dtu.dk; sudou@dtu.dk; hbre@dtu.dk; matst@dtu.dk,"Dou, Suguang/AAH-3749-2019; Pollini, Nicolò/N-8816-2019; Stolpe, Mathias/B-3094-2010; Pegalajar-Jurado, Antonio/ABF-4299-2020","Dou, Suguang/0000-0002-8136-9437; Pollini, Nicolò/0000-0001-8504-6005; Stolpe, Mathias/0000-0002-5858-1595; Pegalajar-Jurado, Antonio/0000-0002-1374-5912; Bredmose, Henrik/0000-0001-6961-0753",Innovation Fund Denmark (IFD) [8055-00075B],This work was carried out as part of the FloatStep project.

To determine its mechanical properties, those micropillars are measured by instrument indentation testing (IIT) to obtain its hardness and reduced modulus. For the measurement, a Berkovich diamond indenter is utilized to penetrate a single and also multiple point indentations on a micro-pillar surface.

Didactic phenomenology is defined as a bridge to study mathematical concepts. Unfortunately, the use of didactic phenomena still leaves problems when formalizing the idea, including the concept of spherical volume. The qualitative method was chosen with a didactic phenomenological design, to explore the transposition of spherical volume construction, to strengthen the results of didactic phenomena based learning. By utilizing didactic phenomena and assuming students know the surface area of the sphere informally, the spherical volume can show. Formally with the concept of the volume of a rotating object and double integrals can be proven the volume of the sphere. With the idea of vector and limit the surface area and volume of the sphere can be determined as students know it.

The term item shall refer to any part, component, device, subsystem, or functional unit of a wind turbine that can be individually described and considered. The model enables wind farm operators and turbine manufactures to find the most cost-effective maintenance strategy for each turbine critical item. Cost optimizations are realized through a better adaptation of the maintenance strategy to the item-specific failure modes, degradation processes, failure detection capabilities and the given operational configuration of the wind farm. Based on a time-sequential Monte Carlo simulation technique, the maintenance activities at turbine level are simulated over the windfarm's operational lifetime, considering correlations between the stochastic variables. The results of the Monte Carlo simulation are evaluated using statistical means, thereby, determining the optimal maintenance strategy and associated parameters. The developed model is implemented as a Python application and equally applicable for onshore and offshore windfarms.","[Reifferscheidt, J.] Siemens Gamesa, Hamburg, Germany; [Weigell, J.; Jahn, C.] Hamburg Univ Technol, Hamburg, Germany","Reifferscheidt, J (corresponding author), Siemens Gamesa, Hamburg, Germany.",jan@reifferscheidt.de,,"Jahn, Carlos/0000-0002-5409-0748",,,"Abernethy R, 2008, NEW WEIBULL HDB, V; Golub G.

However, research on bottom-fixed offshore wind turbines has shown that interactions among turbines in a farm influence both the power production and the structural loading. Furthermore, floating wind turbines (FWTs) are sensitive to low-frequency variations, and therefore to wake meandering perturbations. In the current work, we use the Dynamic Wake Meandering (DWM) model as implemented in DIWA and FAST.Farm, to study the low-frequency content of the meandering at a target turbine placed 8 diameters downstream. At frequencies in the range of the natural frequencies of rigid body motions of semisubmersible floaters, the two models yield different results. These differences are seen for every wind speed and wind turbine model, even though they decrease as the wind speed increases. The observed differences may affect low-frequency motions and consequently mooring system design.","[Rivera-Arreba, I; Bachynski, E.

Some experiences of remote working in different locations have started to be supported by incentives in small municipalities to repopulate remote locations in Italy and people are now more inclined to move not just for vacation. These conditions could lead to a sort of climatic nomadism achievable, among other, through transportable homes. The net-zero energy Green and Transportable Modular Building (GTMB) project is able to cut its environmental impact. It can assume different configurations according to the user's needs. The house is based on a timber construction system, easily adjustable and adaptable according to a modular framework. The energy performance has been simulated by means of BIM/BEM methodologies. The building has been tested in two different climates and configurations according to variable social interaction.

Although many studies have been performed on natural ventilation, the impact of the large set of vaulted roofs on the building cross-ventilation remains to be addressed. In this paper, high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, validated with experimental data, are performed on five naturally ventilated buildings with two opposing windows, each with a specific type of vaulted roof and otherwise identical, in 0 degrees incident flow angle, to assess the impact of vaulted roof geometry on the building cross-ventilation performance. The following vault geometries are investigated and compared against a flat-roof building with the same specifications: (i) segmental, (ii) low-rise pointed, (iii) mid-rise catenary (iv) high-rise pointed and (v) high-rise catenary. The results show that compared to the flat-roof building, the vaulted roofs cause a <5% decrease in volume flow rate and 16-29% increase in the average mean velocity magnitude at the occupants' level. In vaulted buildings, the low-velocity regions of the flow are moved further away from the occupied zone towards the ceiling, thus providing a fresher air to the occupants. The results clarify the high potential of vaulted roofs for natural ventilation and sustainable design.","[Sadeghfar, Milad] Univ Tehran, Tehran, Iran; [Sahebzadeh, Sadra] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands","Sadeghfar, M (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Tehran, Iran.",sadeghfar.milad@ut.ac.ir,,,,,"Franke J, 2011, INT J ENVIRON POLLUT, V44, P419, DOI 10.1504/IJEP.2011.03844; Heidari A, 2017, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V9, DOI 10.3390/su906104; Karava P, 2011, BUILD ENVIRON, V46, P266, DOI 10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.07.02; Peren JI, 2015, BUILD ENVIRON, V85, P263, DOI 10.1016/j.buildenv.2014.12.00; Sahebzadeh S, 2018, SMART SUSTAIN BUIL; Sahebzadeh S, 2020, ENERG CONVERS MANAGE, V226, DOI 10.1016/j.enconman.2020.11352; Sahebzadeh S, 2020, J PHYS CONF SER, V1618, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1618/4/04200; Sahebzadeh S, 2017, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V9, DOI 10.3390/su905074",8,0,0,0,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12106,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012106,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100106,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.0016386726751331422,1.6636252935074626e-07,0.0015517204240946263,0.10098461029290087,0.0015200478670793249

The results show that the blockage effects of the highrise buildings decelerates the wind in the streets parallel to the flow while accelerating the flow in the streets perpendicular to the flow. This effect is evident up to a two block distance upstream of the high-rises. Furthermore, it is shown that consequent rows of high-rises in the downstream of the first row facing the wind flow have little effect on the upstream pedestrian wind; however, they have a significant role in the extent of affected areas downstream.

This study focuses on the impact of wind direction on wind energy potential of a previously optimized building-integrated duct geometry [1], embedded in a generic isolated high-rise building. The mean power density at the duct throat (where the turbine can be installed) is investigated in four wind directions of theta = 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees. High-fidelity steady RANS simulations, validated with experimental data, are used. The results show that the studied duct can increase the mean power density at its throat (i.e. rotor plane) up to 7.08 - 24.8 times that of the freestream flow at the same height for a wide range of -60 degrees <= theta <= 60 degrees. The variation of wind energy potential in different wind directions is shown to be due to the increased size of the nozzle stagnation and separation regions for. > 0 degrees which limit the nozzle effective area and lower flowrate through the throat. Flow deviation from the duct central axis towards its walls further depletes the wind energy in friction.","[Sahebzadeh, Sadra; Montazeri, Hamid; Rezaeiha, Abdolrahim] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Rezaeiha, Abdolrahim] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium","Sahebzadeh, S (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands.",s.sahebzadeh@tue.nl,"Montazeri, Hamid/H-9139-2012",,SURF Cooperative;  [FWO 12ZP520N],The 3<SUP>rd</SUP> author is a postdoctoral fellow of the Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO) and is grateful for its financial support (project FWO 12ZP520N).

In this paper, a shallow feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) surrogate model is developed. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is used to train a model with 3 layers and 10 hidden nodes. The model correlates the arrangement of a double-rotor vertical axis wind turbine array, as the fundamental generating cell of the wind farm, with its overall power performance. The inputs are the relative distance (R) and angle (Phi) between the rotors, and the output is the overall power coefficient of the array. In total, 96 CFD-simulated arrangements are used as data points to train, validate and test the model. The trained model has a mean square error of 2.10 x 10(-5) and R-squared of 0.99, indicating its accuracy and generalizability. The average and maximum errors are 3% and 10%, respectively. The employed method can be expanded to accommodate more rotors towards optimal urban wind farm layout design.","[Sahebzadeh, Sadra; Rezaeiha, Abdolrahim; Montazeri, Hamid] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Rezaeiha, Abdolrahim] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium","Sahebzadeh, S (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands.",s.sahebzadeh@tue.nl,"Montazeri, Hamid/H-9139-2012",,SURF Cooperative;  [FWO 12ZP520N],The 2nd author is currently a postdoctoral fellow of the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO) and is grateful for its financial support (project FWO 12ZP520N).

However, the student's learning outcomes of chemistry subject at SMAN 7 Palu using this learning model are not satisfactory because the students' scores have not passed the passing grade. Therefore, it is needed other learning model that has the characteristics of the scientific approach to be implemented. The purpose of this study is to see whether the application of the guided inquiry learning model based on the scientific approach in Fundamental Chemical Law topic can provide better learning outcomes for students in class X of SMA Negeri 7 Palu compared to the discovery learning model. The research method was a quasi-experimental study by conducting the experimental group and control groups. The results obtained by this study, to be precise the learning achievement data reached 92,1% to 96,05% in the experimental class 1 and 91.35% - 94.75% in the experimental class 2. While student's learning outcomes obtained an average of 56,48 and 46,25 with a standard deviation of 11,07 and 11,98. These values prove that the guided inquiry learning model to provide better learning outcomes compared to discovery learning. Furthermore, based on the two samples t-test results obtained, it was found that - t(table) < t(coun)> + t(table) (-1.68 < 2.99 > +1.68) with a significant level (alpha = 0.05) and degrees of freedom 41.

The informal sector has the worst impact. Thus, both the government and the private sector make various efforts in overcoming problems of social impact that arise. One of them is through the formation of the Task Force for the Acceleration of Handling Covid19 (covid19.go.id ) as a single contact crisis center. However, the extent of the impact that arises will result in preventive, curative and promotive efforts at risk of not being handled properly. The implementation of knowledge management based on graphs (knowledge graph) will enable agile integration between various sources of information. The Graph Data Model captures the relationships of various different entities by connecting them through the edge of information extracted from various heterogeneous sources. After the data is represented in a graphical format, there are various analytic graph techniques for asking multi-hop (multi-node) relationships between entities in the knowledge graph that is built.

In this contribution, an analysis of the operational data from five energy laboratories in the trinational Upper-Rhine region is evaluated and a comparison to a conventional reference system is presented. Ten exemplary data-sets representing typical operation conditions for the laboratories in different seasons and the latest information on their national energy strategies are used to evaluate the primary energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and demand-related costs.

We evaluate these effects based on yaw-corrected power and thrust curves and tabulated turbine load simulation results. In a first step, wind direction and wind speed dependent yaw angles were determined by maximization of the wind farm power for an example wind farm. Secondly, the optimizations were repeated for the objective of minimal flapwise blade fatigue loads. The results were then combined such that the power optimized yaw angles dominate the partial load region while the load optimized results were chosen for higher wind speeds. We find that this combination increases the annual energy production in an example wind rose while simultaneously reducing the lifetime damage equivalent loads. The analysis was repeated including wind direction uncertainty into the optimization. This significantly reduced the benefit of wake steering on AEP but caused only a mild decrease of the overall load reduction.","[Schmidt, Jonas; Requate, Niklas; Vollmer, Lukas] Fraunhofer Inst Wind Energy Syst, Am Seedeich 45, D-27572 Bremerhaven, Germany","Schmidt, J (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Inst Wind Energy Syst, Am Seedeich 45, D-27572 Bremerhaven, Germany.",jonas.schmidt@iwes.fraunhofer.de; niklas.requate@iwes.fraunhofer.de; lukas.vollmer@iwes.fraunhofer.de,,,BMWi [FKZ 0324005],"The simulations were partly performed at the HPC Cluster EDDY, located at the University of Oldenburg (Germany) and funded by BMWi (FKZ 0324005).","Annoni J, 2016, WIND ENERGY, V19, P1135, DOI 10.1002/we.189; Bastankhah M, 2016, J FLUID MECH, V806, P506, DOI 10.1017/jfm.2016.59; Biscani F, 2020, J OPEN SOURCE SOFTW, V5, P2338, DOI [10.21105/joss.02338, DOI 10.21105/JOSS.02338; Campagnolo F, 2016, P AMER CONTR CONF, P513, DOI 10.1109/ACC.2016.752496; Ciri U, 2016, P AMER CONTR CONF, P531, DOI 10.1109/ACC.2016.752496; Doekemeijer BM, 2020, RENEW ENERG, V156, P719, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2020.04.00; Fleming PA, 2016, WIND ENERGY, V19, P329, DOI 10.1002/we.183; Harrison M, 2020, J PHYS CONF SER, V1618, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1618/2/02200; Huhn ML, 2020, J PHYS CONF SER, V1618, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1618/5/05202; Jonkman BJ., 2009, TURBSIM USERS GUID; Kanev SK, 2018, WIND ENERGY, V21, P488, DOI 10.1002/we.217; Kanev S, 2020, ENERGIES, V13, DOI 10.3390/en1316408; Kragh KA, 2014, WIND ENERGY, V17, P971, DOI 10.1002/we.161; Leimeister M, 2020, ENERGIES, V13, DOI 10.3390/en1308197; Popko W, 2018, IWT75164 IWE; Quick J, 2020, WIND ENERGY SCI, V5, P413, DOI 10.5194/wes-5-413-202; Rott A, 2018, WIND ENERGY SCI, V3, P869, DOI 10.5194/wes-3-869-201; Schmidt J, 2014, EWEA C P BARC SPAI; Schmidt J, 2015, EWEA C P PAR FRAN; Schmidt J, 2021 FARM LAYO UNPU; Schmidt J, 2015, J PHYS CONF SER, V625, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/625/1/01204; Thomas P., P 10 INT MOD C LINK, P93; van Dijk MT, 2016, J PHYS CONF SER, V753, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/753/6/06201; Vollmer L, 2019, THESIS U OLDENBURG ",24,0,0,0,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1934.0,,,,,,,,12020,10.1088/1742-6596/1934/1/012020,,10,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Mechanical; Mechanics; Physics, Fluids & Plasmas",Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Mechanics; Physics,BS3JN,WOS:000712011500020,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.004916018025399427,7.382020381238077e-05,0.017420202277962607,0.11229700510650044,0.017085818316933156

In practice, rule-based control and PID controllers are typically used and implemented at the beginning of the building operation. Since this approach neither guarantees optimal or even good control, optimal control algorithms (which can be predictive and adaptive) are in the focus of research. The problem with most of the approaches is that a model of the system is often needed which comes with high engineering efforts. Further, the required computing power can quickly exceed the capacities, even in modern buildings. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the application of a state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, as a self-calibrating valve controller for two water-air heat exchangers of a real-world air handling unit. We choose a generic problem formulation to pre-train the algorithm with a simulation of an admixing heater and use it to control an injection heater and a throttle cooler. Our results show that after only 70 hours, the control quality significantly increases. Therefore, it seems evident that with pre-trained RL algorithms, a self-improving HVAC automation can be realized with little hardware requirements and without extensive modelling of the system dynamics.","[Schreiber, T.; Schwartz, A.; Mueller, D.] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Mathieustr 10, D-52072 Aachen, Germany","Schreiber, T (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Mathieustr 10, D-52072 Aachen, Germany.",thomas.schreiber@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,,,BMWi (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy) [03SBE0006A],"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the BMWi (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy), promotional reference 03SBE0006A.","Abel D, 2018, UMDRUCK VORLESUNG R; Afram A, 2014, BUILD ENVIRON, V72, P343, DOI 10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.11.01; Agarwal A, 2015, TENSOROW LARGE SCAL; Berger J, 2014, PHILOS PSYCHOL, V27, P829, DOI 10.1080/09515089.2013.77124; Blochwitz T., 2012, P 9 INT MODELICA C S, DOI [10.3384/ecp12076173, DOI 10.3384/ECP12076173; Brockman G., OPENAI GY; Dayana P, 2008, CURR OPIN NEUROBIOL, V18, P185, DOI 10.1016/j.conb.2008.08.00; Gorges D, 2017, IFAC PAPERSONLINE, V50, P4920, DOI 10.1016/j.ifacol.2017.08.74; Han M., 2018, REV REINFORCEMENT L; Mason K, 2019, COMPUT ELECTR ENG, V78, P300, DOI 10.1016/j.compeleceng.2019.07.01; Mirinejad H, 2008, J COMPUTER SCI, V; Mnih V, 2015, NATURE, V518, P529, DOI 10.1038/nature1423; Mohri M, 2018, FDN MACHINE LEARNING, V2n; Muller D., 2016, BAUSIM, V2016, P; Recknagel, 2017, TASCH HEIZ KLIM 201; Schreiber T, 2021, ENERGY, V230, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2021.12089; Sutton RS, 2018, ADAPT COMPUT MACH LE, P; Wang Z, 2020, APPL ENERG, V269, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.11503; Yuan XL, 2021, BUILD SIMUL-CHINA, V14, P75, DOI 10.1007/s12273-020-0602-",19,1,1,1,2,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12028,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012028,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100028,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.0038918476034412127,6.214879047404611e-05,0.12518314701772945,0.1316825807843772,0.13304774084703605

The two co-rotating vortices are generated in a water channel by a one-bladed rotor, whose tip geometry is modified by the addition of a perpendicular fin on the pressure side. The fin parameters are tuned so that the two vortices have approximately equal circulation. Dye visualisations and flow field measurements from Particle Image Velocimetry show that the vortices merge into a single tip vortex within less than one rotor rotation. This fast merging is caused by a rapid increase of the core radii of the initial vortices, which indicates the presence of an instability phenomenon. Analysis of the vortex velocity profiles identifies it as a centrifugal instability, linked to the presence of opposite-signed vorticity in the blade tip region. We further explore the origin of this vorticity by modifying the streamwise fin position. Measurements suggest that the interaction between the secondary fin vortex and the blade surface is partly responsible for the generation of the unstable velocity profile. The vortex resulting from the merging has a significantly larger core size than the one developing without a fin, indicating that this configuration could be beneficial in the context of Blade-Vortex Interaction noise for helicopters, or for the reduction of fatigue loads on wind turbine rotors caused by the interaction with concentrated tip vortices in the wake of upstream turbines.","[Schroeder, D.; Hoernschemeyer, R.; Stumpf, E.] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Aerosp Syst, D-52062 Aachen, Germany; [Leweke, T.] Aix Marseille Univ, Cent Marseille, CNRS, IRPHE, F-13384 Marseille, France","Schroder, D (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Aerosp Syst, D-52062 Aachen, Germany.",schroeder@ilr.rwth-aachen.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [391677260]; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-17-CE06-0018],"This work is part of the German-French project TWIN-HELIX, supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (grant no. 391677260) and the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (grant no.

Looking at the rotor blades, two-bladed turbines with a comparable design either rotate 22.5% faster or have up to 50% increased chord lengths. The latter result in a significantly higher second moment of area, which enables rotor mass savings and thus fewer costs while withstanding similar to 50% higher flapwise loads per blade. Unfortunately, such a design could also cause buckling issues. increasing the design tip speed reduces stability issues but lowers the rotor mass savings. Consequently, the challenging task is to find an optimal compromise between preventing buckling and saving rotor mass, and thus to ensure a fair comparison of two- and three-bladed turbines' blades. To overcome this challenge, a procedure for redesigning a comparable blade structure is introduced. The procedure is exemplarily demonstrated for large 20 MW offshore wind turbines. Compared to the three-bladed reference, the overall rotor mass reduction of the two-bladed turbine is 13.5% for the most beneficial compromise detected. Simultaneously, the blades showing good accordance with the reference concerning static stresses and buckling characteristics under their respective loads.","[Schuett, Marcel; Anstock, Fabian; Schorbach, Vera] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Berliner Tor 21, D-20099 Hamburg, Germany","Schutt, M (corresponding author), Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Berliner Tor 21, D-20099 Hamburg, Germany.",marcel.schuett@haw-hamburg.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy [13FH1I04IA],"The present work is part of the four-year research project \X-Rotor {two-bladed wind turbinesfunded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (reference 13FH1I04IA), whom we would here like to thank.","Anstock F., 2021, J PHYS C SERIE; Anstock F, 2020, J PHYS CONF SER, V1618, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1618/2/02206; Anstock F, 2019, J PHYS CONF SER, V1356, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1356/1/01200; Blasques JP, 2012, COMPOS STRUCT, V94, P3278, DOI 10.1016/j.compstruct.2012.05.00; Bottasso C.

With the changing situation in carrying out work activities during this pandemic, it will certainly affect the quality of organization in companies and the quality of education in schools and colleges. In order to identify all processes in teaching and learning activities that are running well or not, schools need to monitor and measure employee performance. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are generally used as benchmarks to determine how well a company's performance can be represented by employee performance. In this study, the key performance indicator preparation process was carried out through the stages of designing a questionnaire, distributing questionnaires to employees in educational institutions, conducting factor analysis and then developing a KPI model. The output is in the form of a KPI model that can be used as a reference in the formation of KPIs in educational institutions, namely Y = 5,360 + 1,380 X1 -1,068 X3.","[Selviyanti, E.] Politekn Negeri Jember, Hlth Dept, Jember 68124, Jawa Timur, Indonesia; [Sardjono, W.] Bina Nusantara Univ, Informat Syst Management Dept, BINUS Grad Program Master Informat Syst Managemen, Jakarta 11480, Indonesia; [Mukhlis, M.] Islamic State Inst Jember, Fac Teacher Training & Educ, Jember, Jawa Timur, Indonesia; [Tohir, M.; Maswar, M.] Univ Ibrahimy, Situbondo, Indonesia; [Fariz, A.] SMK 3 Perguruan Cikini, Comp Network Engn, Jakarta 12640, Indonesia","Selviyanti, E (corresponding author), Politekn Negeri Jember, Hlth Dept, Jember 68124, Jawa Timur, Indonesia.",ernaselviyanti@polije.ac.id,"Tohir, Mohammad/AAE-8527-2019; Selviyanti, Erna/AAL-4695-2021; Maswar, Maswar/AAB-2456-2020","Tohir, Mohammad/0000-0001-8342-0972; Selviyanti, Erna/0000-0001-8161-9304; Maswar, Maswar/0000-0002-1025-4667; Fariz, Ahmad/0000-0002-7753-5623",,,"Edvardsson B, 1996, SERV IND J, V16, P140, DOI 10.1080/0264206960000001; Farid D, 2008, U BUCUR AN SER STIIN, V2, P2; Kaplan R., 2006, ALIGNMENT BALANCED ; Kaplan R.

The policies or technologies, which try to mitigate these emissions often end up 'rebounding' i.e. the savings of energy (bills) caused by these measures, induce further expenses in other (e.g. travel) or same (e.g. electricity) categories, leading to (partial) offsetting of the emissions saving. This research introduces application of a data-driven bottom up method to evaluate these rebound emissions based on the household consumption (expenses) and properties. Two scenarios of energy-savings measures are evaluated here: (1) switching to energy-efficient devices, and (2) switching to renewable energy. The results are discussed for households with varying income, region of residence and household size. The results show that higher income and bigger households have higher total rebounds for both scenarios, while Zurich has lowest compared to all other Swiss regions.","[Shinde, Rhythima; Peng, Sidi; Vijay, Saloni; Hellweg, Stefanie; Froemelt, Andreas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, D BAUG, Inst Environm Engn, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Shinde, Rhythima] Ecol Syst Design, John von Neumann Weg 9, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Shinde, R (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, D BAUG, Inst Environm Engn, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.;Shinde, R (corresponding author), Ecol Syst Design, John von Neumann Weg 9, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",shinde@ifu.baug.ethz.ch,"Hellweg, Stefanie/AAA-7756-2019; Froemelt, Andreas/F-3078-2015","Hellweg, Stefanie/0000-0001-6376-9878; Vijay, Saloni/0000-0001-5883-5308; Froemelt, Andreas/0000-0001-9388-7816",SNSF Swiss National Science Foundation [NRP73],This research is carried out with the grants from the NRP73 - Sustainable Economy from SNSF Swiss National Science Foundation).,"Aune M, 2007, ENERG POLICY, V35, P5457, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2007.05.00; Aydin E, 2017, RAND J ECON, V48, P749, DOI 10.1111/1756-2171.1219; Boogen N, 2017, ENERG ECON, V63, P288, DOI 10.1016/j.eneco.2017.02.00; Chitnis M, 2014, ECOL ECON, V106, P12, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2014.07.00; Chitnis M, 2013, ENERG POLICY, V55, P234, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2012.12.00; Druckman A., 2016, TAKING STOCK IND ECO, P181, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-20571-7_; Du P, 2014, ENERG POLICY, V75, P206, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2014.09.02; European commission, 2015, BEST PRACTICES RENE; Freire-Gonzalez J, 2011, ECOL MODEL, V223, P32, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.09.00; Froemelt A, 2020, ENVIRON RES LETT, V15, DOI 10.1088/1748-9326/abb50; Froemelt A, 2020, J IND ECOL, V24, P639, DOI 10.1111/jiec.1296; Froemelt A, 2018, ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL, V52, P8467, DOI 10.1021/acs.est.8b0145; Ivanova D, 2016, J IND ECOL, V20, P526, DOI 10.1111/jiec.1237; Khazzoom J.D., 1986, ECONOMETRIC MODEL I; Khazzoom J.D., 1980, ENERG J, V1, P21, DOI DOI 10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-VOL1-NO4-; Liu Y., 2014, COMPUT MODEL NEW TEC, V18, P14; Long MS, 2015, PR MACH LEARN RES, V37, P9; Nathani C., 2011, FOEN, V54, P17; Nau R., 2020, WHATS GOOD VALUE R ; Nejat P, 2015, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V43, P843, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2014.11.06; Rana P, 2020, CURR OPIN BIOTECH, V64, P85, DOI 10.1016/j.copbio.2019.11.00; Streimikiene D, 2014, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V35, P285, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2014.04.01; Takase K, 2005, J IND ECOL, V9, P201, DOI 10.1162/108819805408465",23,2,2,0,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12127,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012127,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100127,,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-07-14,0.004711183941007784,1.0984522449749657e-11,0.03072330813802754,0.06614279907871562,0.03072330813802754

It is shown that, at certain critical values for bubble size, flow velocity, and contamination level, the axial symmetry of the surface flow loses its stability in a threshold manner, and the first instability mode in the form of two vortices appears. Below the threshold, the stationary flow on the bubble surface is impossible. The experimental results indicate that the assumption about the axial symmetry of the motion on the bubble surface containing surfactants, which is used in most theoretical and numerical studies, is invalid. Analysis of the results has revealed the most likely reason for the spiral form of the trajectory in the problem of a small rising bubble in the surrounding fluid. For the surfactant-free surface realized in the experiments with isopropyl alcohol, the rising trajectory was a straight line, and no vortex structures were observed on the bubble surface. In the experiments with water, a spiral rising trajectory was observed, and the first instability mode was formed on the bubble surface.","[Shmyrova, Anastasia; Shmyrov, Andrey] Inst Continuous Media Mech, Ak Koroleva St 1, Perm 614000, Russia","Shmyrova, A (corresponding author), Inst Continuous Media Mech, Ak Koroleva St 1, Perm 614000, Russia.",lutsik@cmm.ru,"Shmyrov, Andrey/AAB-5835-2022",,Russian Science Foundation [19-71-00097],This research was supported by Russian Science Foundation (Grant No.: 19-71-00097).,"CARPENTER B, 1985, J FLUID MECH, V155, P429, DOI 10.1017/S002211208500188; Cuenot B, 1997, J FLUID MECH, V339, P25, DOI 10.1017/S002211209700505; GRIFFITH RM, 1962, IND ENG CHEM FUND, V1, P180, DOI 10.1021/i160003a00; HARPER JF, 1974, Q J MECH APPL MATH, V27, P87, DOI 10.1093/qjmam/27.1.8; HOMSY GM, 1984, J FLUID MECH, V139, P443, DOI 10.1017/S002211208400044; Koleski G, 2020, PHYS FLUIDS, V32, DOI 10.1063/5.001871; Krzan M, 2002, COLLOID SURFACE A, V207, P279, DOI 10.1016/S0927-7757(02)00163-; LOGLIO G, 1989, NUOVO CIMENTO C, V12, P289, DOI 10.1007/BF0250720; Maceiras R, 2007, CHEM ENG SCI, V62, P6747, DOI 10.1016/j.ces.2007.06.02; Mizev A, 2005, PHYS FLUIDS, V17, DOI 10.1063/1.215079; Mizev AI, 2014, FLUID DYNAM+, V49, P26, DOI 10.1134/S001546281401005; Muradoglu M, 2014, J COMPUT PHYS, V274, P737, DOI 10.1016/j.jcp.2014.06.02; Palaparthi R, 2006, J FLUID MECH, V559, P1, DOI 10.1017/S002211200500701; PARK WC, 1995, EXP FLUIDS, V19, P167, DOI 10.1007/BF0018970; Pshenichnikov A, 1974, FLUID DYNAMICS, V5, P17; Roche M, 2014, PHYS REV LETT, V112, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.20830; SADA E, 1977, CHEM ENG SCI, V32, P1171, DOI 10.1016/0009-2509(77)80049-; Shmyrova A, 2019, EPJ WEB CONF, V213, DOI 10.1051/epjconf/20192130207; SUCIU DG, 1970, J COLLOID INTERF SCI, V33, P520, DOI 10.1016/0021-9797(70)90003-; SUCIU DG, 1967, AICHE J, V13, P1120, DOI 10.1002/aic.69013061; Takagi S, 2009, FLUID DYN RES, V41, DOI 10.1088/0169-5983/41/6/06500; Wu TC, 2000, INT COMMUN HEAT MASS, V27, P655, DOI 10.1016/S0735-1933(00)00147-",22,1,1,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1945.0,,,,,,,,12053,10.1088/1742-6596/1945/1/012053,,7,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Mechanics",Materials Science; Mechanics,BS4HU,WOS:000719382600053,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-07-14,0.004506349856616141,1.5670060673365917e-10,0.03240655876975667,0.07277443205533361,0.03634934822199208

This study aimed to describe the effectiveness of the STEM learning model in improving the creative thinking skills of students. It was a quasi-experimental research with Posttest-Only Design with Nonequivalent Groups. Based on data analysis, there was an effect of STEM education on students' creative thinking skills. Based on the research results obtained from students' creativity varies between low and moderate and the answers to the creativity tests given show lower results than expected. STEM can be recommended as an alternative and approach in learning biology, especially in improving students' creative thinking abilities.

The real-time hybrid model considered includes a multi-fan system located at the aero-rotor interface, which permits to generate the aerodynamic loads, reducing the limitations typically given by scaled problems. In order to assess the uncertainties in the hardware in the loop (HIL) implementation, firstly we define the quantities of interest to be evaluated from all the possible sources liable to inaccuracy identified. Then, we quantify the systematic and random discrepancies of the selected mooring, platform and HIL parameters. Finally, we propagate the previously quantified errors, running simulations in OpenFAST under extremal and severe environmental load cases in Gran Canaria Island (Spain) site. Comparing the platform response and mooring tensions of these uncertainty propagations with the ones of the unperturbed simulation as a baseline case, we analyse the effect of each representative parameter. Thus, the reliability of the results in ocean basin testing is numerically assessed, depending on the design load case.","[Somoano, Miguel; Battistella, Tommaso; Fernandez-Ruano, Sergio; Guanche, Raul] Univ Cantabria, IHCantabria Inst Hidraul Ambiental, PCTCAN, Isabel Torres 15, Santander 39011, Spain","Somoano, M (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria, IHCantabria Inst Hidraul Ambiental, PCTCAN, Isabel Torres 15, Santander 39011, Spain.",miguel.somoano@unican.es,"Guanche, Raul/AAO-1515-2021; SOMOANO, MIGUEL/A-2514-2019","Guanche, Raul/0000-0001-9768-1727; SOMOANO, MIGUEL/0000-0002-1666-1079","National Programme for Research, Development and Innovation Aimed at the Challenges of Society [ENE2017-89716-R]; Ramon y Cajal Program of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [RYC-2017-23260];  [815083]","This work is part of two research Projects: i) ACOPLE -Analisis del COmportamiento dinamico de PLataformas Eolicas flotantes para la optimizacion del diseno de aguas profundas (grant agreement no.

Such public spaces create interaction opportunities for citizens to seek thermal pleasure outdoors. To inform about the citizens' thermal experience of these spaces, this paper explores fieldwork and data analysis methods at the crossroads of urban climatology, environmental psychology and urban design. Four spatio-climatic configurations are investigated in the 'Extraordinary Garden' in Nantes (France) through mobile microclimate measurements and ethnographic observations. By applying an 'urban transect' approach, preliminary selected microclimate, behavioural and activity observation data is displayed together with spatial information. This allows to highlight thermal situations induced by urban design and to link them to specific citizen-environment interactions. As a result, this approach contributes to a better characterization of urban cool spots as a strategy for more resilient public spaces.","[Stavropulos-Laffaille, X.; Requena-Ruiz, I; Drozd, C.; Leduc, T.; Servieres, M.; Siret, D.] ENSA Nantes, CRENAU AAU UMR 1563 CNRS ECN ENSAG ENSAN, 6 Quai Francois Mitterrand,BP 16202, F-44262 Nantes, France","Requena-Ruiz, I (corresponding author), ENSA Nantes, CRENAU AAU UMR 1563 CNRS ECN ENSAG ENSAN, 6 Quai Francois Mitterrand,BP 16202, F-44262 Nantes, France.",ignacio.requena@crenau.archi.fr,"Leduc, Thomas/H-2228-2011","Leduc, Thomas/0000-0002-5728-9787; Requena-Ruiz, Ignacio/0000-0002-8011-1880",French National Agency of research (ANR) [ANR-18-CE22-0003],The authors acknowledge the support of the French National Agency of research (ANR) under reference ANR-18-CE22-0003 (COOLSCAPES project).,"Chen L, 2012, CITIES, V29, P118, DOI 10.1016/j.cities.2011.08.00; Coccolo S, 2016, URBAN CLIM, V18, P33, DOI 10.1016/j.uclim.2016.08.00; Gehl J., 2011, LIFE BUILDINGS USIN; Heft H., 2010, INNOVATIVE APPROACHE, V2, P; Johansson E, 2014, URBAN CLIM, V10, P346, DOI 10.1016/j.uclim.2013.12.00; Kytta M, 2004, J ENVIRON PSYCHOL, V24, P179, DOI 10.1016/S0272-4944(03)00073-; Middel A, 2019, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V687, P137, DOI 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.06.08; Nicol F, 2012, ADAPTIVE THERMAL COMFORT: PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE, P; Popovic M, 2017, LAMELIORATION CONFO; Sharifi E, 2020, INT J BIOMETEOROL, V64, P231, DOI 10.1007/s00484-018-1570-; Tixier N, 2016, TERRAIN, P13",11,0,0,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12128,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012128,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100128,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.0022531749283080703,1.4128060079402438e-10,0.004090946498341448,0.0947078451152324,0.00392652139244126

We study how well these models capture the wake effects between two aligned wind farms with 72 turbines separated by 10 kilometers in a neutral boundary layer. We find that all considered models over-predict the wind farm wake recovery compared to what is observed in LES. The TurbOPark model predictions on the wind farm wake effect are closest to the LES results for the scenario considered here.","[Stieren, Anja; Stevens, Richard J. A.

Since buildings are complex multiple input multiple output systems and characterized by slow dynamics, model predictive control is a promising approach to reduce building energy consumption. Due to the high individual modeling effort model predictive control lacks practical applicability. For that reason black box process models are gaining more and more interest in scientific literature. In this work we evaluate the performance of an ANN based controller against a white box controller with perfect knowledge. We show that the data driven controller achieves a similar control quality as the white box controller. We initially train the data driven controller in 20 days and then employ an online learning strategy to continuously improve the control quality.","[Stoffel, Phillip; Berktold, Max; Gall, Arman; Kuempel, Alexander; Mueller, Dirk] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany","Stoffel, P (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",phillip.stoffel@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,,,BMWi (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy) [03ETW006A],"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the BMWi (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy), promotional reference 03ETW006A.","Afram A, 2015, ENERG BUILDINGS, V94, P121, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.02.04; Andersson JAE, 2019, MATH PROGRAM COMPUT, V11, P1, DOI 10.1007/s12532-018-0139-; Arendt K, 2018, ASHRAE IBPSA USA BUI, P17; Drgona J, 2020, ANNU REV CONTROL, V50, P190, DOI 10.1016/j.arcontrol.2020.09.00; Drgona J, 2020, J PROCESS CONTR, V88, P63, DOI 10.1016/j.jprocont.2020.02.00; Freund S, 2021, BUILD ENVIRON, V197, DOI 10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.10783; Jain A, 2018, ACM IEEE INT CONF CY, P140, DOI 10.1109/ICCPS.2018.0002; K~umpel A, 2019, REPRESENTATIVE SIMU; Kathirgamanathan A, 2021, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V135, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2020.11012; Knebel D E, 2007, ASHRAE STANDARDS COM, P26; Morari M, 2020, ARXIV200107831 CS E; Mugnini A, 2020, ENERGIES, V13, DOI 10.3390/en1312312; Muller D., 2016, BAUSIM, V2016, P; Picard D, 2017, ENERG BUILDINGS, V152, P739, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.07.02; Smarra F, 2020, NONLINEAR ANAL-HYBRI, V36, DOI 10.1016/j.nahs.2020.10088; Sturzenegger D, 2016, IEEE T CONTR SYST T, V24, P1, DOI 10.1109/TCST.2015.241541; Wachter A, 2006, MATH PROGRAM, V106, P25, DOI 10.1007/s10107-004-0559-; Yang SY, 2020, APPL ENERG, V271, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.11514",18,0,0,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12043,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012043,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100043,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.00368701351904957,3.577282449759233e-07,0.010416879492387017,0.10537903643584873,0.009807610498827871

At the same time, however, more and more building monitoring data is being collected. The manual evaluation of this data is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Hence, there is a strong need for tools that enable the automatic knowledge extraction from these huge data sets to support system integrators and favor the development of smart energy services, e.g., predictive maintenance. One crucial step in knowledge extraction is the detection of change points and hidden states in measurements. In this work, we present a tool for automated detection of hidden operation modes based on multivariate time series data deploying motif-aware state assignment (MASA). The tool is evaluated utilizing measurements of a heat pump and compared to two baseline algorithms, namely k-Means and k-Medoids. MASA performs particularly well on noisy data, where it shows only a small deviation in the number of detected change points compared to the ground truth with up to 77% accuracy. Furthermore, it almost always outperforms the baseline algorithms, which in turn require extensive preprocessing.","[Storek, Thomas; Kriwet, Jonathan; Kuempel, Alexander; Mueller, Dirk] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany","Storek, T (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, EON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",tstorek@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,,,Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) [03ET1495A],"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), promotional reference 03ET1495A.","Afram A, 2017, ENERG BUILDINGS, V141, P96, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.02.01; Afram A, 2014, BUILD ENVIRON, V72, P343, DOI 10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.11.01; Aghabozorgi S, 2015, INFORM SYST, V53, P16, DOI 10.1016/j.is.2015.04.00; Barandas M, 2020, SOFTWAREX, V11, DOI 10.1016/j.softx.2020.10045; Bode G, 2020, ENERGY, V198, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2020.11732; Christ M, 2018, NEUROCOMPUTING, V307, P72, DOI 10.1016/j.neucom.2018.03.06; Futterer J P, 2017, PRAXIS TECH RE; Hallac D, 2018, PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWENTY-SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, P5254, DOI 10.1145/3097983.309806; Jain S, 2019, PREPRINT 18090181; Kapp V, 2020, J MANUF MATER PROC, V4, DOI 10.3390/jmmp403008; Kathirgamanathan A, 2021, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V135, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2020.11012; Miller C, 2018, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V81, P1365, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.12; Ratz M, 2019, ENERG BUILDINGS, V202, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.10938; Stinner F, 2019, J PHYS CONF SER, V1343, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1343/1/01203; Storek T, 2019, P BUILDING SIMULATIO, P90; Truong C, 2020, SIGNAL PROCESS, V167, DOI 10.1016/j.sigpro.2019.10729; Waide Paul, 2014, SCOPE ENERGY CO2 SA",17,0,0,2,2,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12071,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012071,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100071,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.003482179434657927,1.0566322643162644e-06,0.006290288513997649,0.10550200976790422,0.006249641815358424

The research subjects consisted of 2 lecturers, and students who had taken Mathematical Method for Physics Courses, namely levels 3 and 4. The number of students filling out questionnaires was 94 students. Observations were conducted in class. Observations are focused on the learning process in the class. Data was collected using questionnaires to get student responses to the implementation of lectures. The results of the study were as many as 57.82%. of students gave positive statements about the implementation of lectures, while the rest gave negative statements. This shows that studying physics is not only mastery of a collection of knowledge in the form of facts, concepts, or principles, but also an inquiry process. Therefore, the challenge in facing the 21st century is to improve the quality of education. Learning innovation is adjusted to the demands of educational change in the era of industrial revolution 4.0 (millennial). Learning must utilize information, communication, and technology (ICT).

The dynamic of achievement emotions in mathematics learning evaluation is very important to be considered by the teachers so that students' academic achievement can be improved. This study was conducted to investigate female students' achievement emotions in mathematical problem-solving situations. The study involved 50 seventh grade female students selected by using purposive sampling technique. The data were collected through achievement emotions questionnaires and mathematical problem- solving ability tests. The data were analyzed using Wilcoxon test and Kendal's Tau correlation test. The findings indicated that mathematical problem-solving situation gave significant small negative effect in decreasing students' joyful emotion. Moreover, it also gave significant small positive effect in increasing students' depressed emotion. In addition, there was a significant moderate correlation between mathematical problem-solving ability and students' joyful emotions after the test. Based on the findings, Mathematics teachers were recommended to take control over the students and improve students' perceived control and confidence value during Mathematics evaluation so that their emotional condition could be well-controlled. Therefore, they could acquire good achievement and the learning objectives could be attained.","[Suparman, S.; Juandi, D.; Herman, T.] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Dept Pendidikan Matemat, Jl Dr Setiabudi 229, Bandung 40154, Indonesia","Suparman, S (corresponding author), Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Dept Pendidikan Matemat, Jl Dr Setiabudi 229, Bandung 40154, Indonesia.",arman95@upi.edu; tatangherman@upi.edu,"Juandi, Dadang/ABH-5621-2020; , Suparman/AAM-5852-2021",", Suparman/0000-0001-9549-8638",Indonesian Endowment Fund of Education (LPDP),The writers would like to deliver greatest gratitude to Indonesian Endowment Fund of Education (LPDP) for the financial support.,"Abbrizzese L., 2019, FRON PSYCHO, V10, P; Aziz S., 2019, PAKISTAN J PSYCHO, V15, P5; Barratt MJ, 2015, FIELD METHOD, V27, P3, DOI 10.1177/1525822X1452683; Barrett LF, 1998, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V74, P967, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.74.4.96; Barrie L., 2016, THESI; Boreinsten M., 2009, INTRO METAANALYSI; Breen C., 2015, MSOR CONNECTIONS, V14, P; Cai J., 2010, EVALUATION MATH ED ; Cheesemen J., 2014, PROCEEDING, P13; Cohen J., 1988, STAT POWER ANAL BEHA, VSecond, DOI 10.4324/978020377158; Cooper H., 1989, HOMEWOR; Cuisinier F, 2010, ANN PSYCHOL, V110, P; Curtis D B., 2012, PRIMUS, V22, P45; Dettmers S, 2011, CONTEMP EDUC PSYCHOL, V36, P25, DOI 10.1016/j.cedpsych.2010.10.00; Efklides A, 2005, LEARN INSTR, V15, P415, DOI 10.1016/j.learninstruc.2005.07.01; Etikan I., 2016, AM J THEOR APPL STAT, V5, P1, DOI [10.11648/j.ajtas.20160501.11, DOI 10.11648/J.AJTAS.20160501.11; FRIJDA N, 1986, EMOTION; Goetz T, 2008, CONTEMP EDUC PSYCHOL, V33, P9, DOI 10.1016/j.cedpsych.2006.12.00; Goetz T, 2007, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V99, P715, DOI 10.1037/0022-0663.99.4.71; Hanin V, 2016, EUR REV APPL PSYCHOL, V66, P127, DOI 10.1016/j.erap.2016.04.00; Holm M E., 2020, LEARN INDI DIFFER, V79, P1; Huang XX, 2019, EUR J PSYCHOL EDUC, V34, P621, DOI 10.1007/s10212-018-0403-; Lazarides R, 2019, LEARN INSTR, V61, P45, DOI 10.1016/j.learninstruc.2019.01.00; Lazarus R.S., 1991, EMOTIONS ADAPTATIO; Leo D I., 2019, CONT ED PSYCHO, V58, P12; Magee W, 2015, J HAPPINESS STUD, V16, P1091, DOI 10.1007/s10902-014-9548-; Matthews J, 2013, TEACH MATH APPL, V32, P173, DOI 10.1093/teamat/hrt01; Mauss I, 2009, COGNITION EMOTION, V23, P209, DOI 10.1080/0269993080220467; Muis KR, 2018, EDUC PSYCHOL-US, V53, P165, DOI 10.1080/00461520.2017.142146; Nash J, 2009, COMMUN RES REP, V26, P114, DOI 10.1080/0882409090286155; Pekrun R., 2007, EMOTION E; Pekrun R., 2012, INDIVIDUAL DIFFEREN; Pekrun R, 2010, SOC PERSONAL PSYCHOL, V4, P238, DOI 10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00259.; Pekrun R, 2011, CONTEMP EDUC PSYCHOL, V36, P36, DOI 10.1016/j.cedpsych.2010.10.00; Podila S P., 2019, IJSRST, V6, P40; Raccanello D, 2018, LEARN INDIVID DIFFER, V65, P65, DOI 10.1016/j.lindif.2018.05.01; Sanchis-Sanchis A., 2020, FRON PSYCHO, V11, P; Scherer K.R., 1984, APPROACHES EMOTIO; Scherer K.R., 2000, NEUROPSYCHOLOGY EMOT, P13; Tongco M.

Several studies have shown low attainment of scientific literacy. A high level of scientific literacy can improve the quality of education so that it can compete with other countries. This study aims to describe the level of scientific literacy of high school students in East Java. The method used in this research is descriptive quantitative. The data collection technique was in the form of a written test. The research variable is the science literacy ability of high school students in the content aspect. Samples were taken using purposive sampling. Overall, the average percentage of the results of high school students' scientific literacy skills in East Java based on the aspect of science content is in the low category. The level of students' understanding of basic science concepts is still low or weak, so that students are less able to apply and interpret data, even though the form of the problem is simple. The cause of the low ability of students is in expressing the content of the discourse given and interpreting the data in the form of pictures, tables, diagrams and other forms of presentation. In addition, there are limitations to the students' ability to express thoughts in written form, reasoning skills, reading accuracy is still low, and students are not used to connecting information in the form of text and then expressing it in the form of new expressions to answer given test questions.","[Suroso, J.] Inst Agama Islam Negeri Jember, Jember, Indonesia; [Indrawati; Sutarto; Mudakir, I] Univ Jember, Fac Teacher Training & Educ, Sci Educ, Jember, Indonesia","Suroso, J (corresponding author), Inst Agama Islam Negeri Jember, Jember, Indonesia.",jokosuroso1965@iain-jember.ac.id,", Sutarto/CAF-7781-2022",", Sutarto/0000-0003-2674-5687; Mudakir, Imam/0000-0002-8883-539X; Suroso, Joko/0000-0002-0134-2243",,,"Afriana J., 2017, J INOV PENDIDIK IPA, P202, DOI [10.21831/jipi.v2i2.8561, DOI 10.21831/JIPI.V2I2.8561; Angraini G., 2014, PROS MATH SCI FOR 20, P16; [Anonymous], UNDANG UNDANG REPUBL, P430; [Anonymous], PAR PEND NAS AB 21 B, P4; [Anonymous], 2016, PERATURAN MENTERI P; Arief MK, 2015, J PENDIDIK FIS INDON, V11, P117, DOI 10.15294/jpfi.v11i2.423; Aryani A K., 2016, PROS SEMN PEND IPA P, V1, P85; Asyhari A., 2017, JURNAL PENDIDIKAN SA, V6, P8; Darma S., 2019, FOCUS GROUP DISCUSS; DeBoer GE, 2000, J RES SCI TEACH, V37, P582, DOI 10.1002/1098-2736(200008)37:6<582::AID-TEA5>3.0.CO;2-; Ekohariadi, 2009, JURNAL PENDIDIKAN DA, V10, P2; Faizah N., 2018, SCI ED JURNAL SEJ, V2, P2; Frydenberg M., 2011, 2011 International Conference on Information Society (i-Society), P31; Graber W, 2001, RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION - PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE, P6; Haristy D R, 2013, JURNAL PENDIDIKAN DA, V2, P; Hasana I, 2017, JURNAL PENDIDIKAN BI, V8, P5; Hasanah U., 2017, JURNAL PENDIDIKAN FI, V3, P8; Holbrook J., 2009, INT J ENV SCI ED, V4, P27; Huryah F, 2017, JURNAL EKSAKTA PENDI, V1, P7; Ismail I, 2016, JURNAL INOVASI PENDI, V2, P19; Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, 2017, MATERI PENDUKUNG GE; Kurnia F, 2014, J INOVASI DAN PEMBEL, V1, P43, DOI 10.36706/jipf.v1i1.126; McCormack A J., 1992, SCI CURRICULUM RESOU, P6; Millar R., 2008, TAKING SCI LIT SERIO, V9, P; Monkman D., 2011, SCI CURRICULUM REV ; Musfiroh T., 2012, K INT KES 22 UNY HIS, P22; Novitasari L dan, 2018, PROSIDING SEMINAR NA, P52; Nurgiyantoro B., 2011, PENILAIAN OTENTIK, P2; OECD, 2019, PISA 2018 RES COMB E, P1; OECD, 2013, PISA 2012 ASS AN FRA, P1; Pratiwi S N, 2019, JURNAL MATERI DAN PE, V9, P3; Purwanto M N., 2013, PRINSIP PRINSIP DA; Rahayu S., 2014, PROSIDING SEMINAR NA, P; Rakhmawan A, 2015, J PENELIT PEMBELAJAR, V1, P143, DOI 10.30870/jppi.v1i1.33; Rismaharini, 2014, CAT 5 TAH SUR SEB K; Rizkita L, 2016, PROSIDING SEMINAR NA, P77; Rusilowati A, 2016, J PENDIDIK FIS INDON, V12, P98, DOI 10.15294/jpfi.v12i2.425; Safitri A, 2016, JURNAL PENDIDIKAN SA, V4, P; Sari D N A, 2017, PANCASAKTI SCI ED J, V2, P11; Sukowati D., 2017, JURNAL PHYS COMMUNIC, V1, P25; Susetyo B A, 2019, GERAKAN LITERASI SE; Trilling B., 2009, 21 CENTURY SKILLS LE, P2; World Economic Forum, 2015, NEW VIS ED UNL POT ; Yuliati Y., 2017, JURNAL CAKRAWALA PEN, V3, P2",44,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1832.0,,,,,,,,12040,10.1088/1742-6596/1832/1/012040,,13,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Physics, Multidisciplinary",Mathematics; Physics,BS0UA,WOS:000684374700040,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.006892326543115331,5.522152349280563e-11,0.03442727890495675,0.12237362472588233,0.03409561375986812

This meta-analysis study was conducted to examine the  Hawthorne effect, or the novelty of using mathematical software in learning. Related databases are sought for studies that qualify for examining the effects of using mathematical software compared to traditional teaching on students' mathematical abilities. Random-effect models with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. 40 effect sizes were analyzed from 40 primary studies that have been published in journals, or national and international proceedings from 2010 to 2020, and a total of 3072 students were included in this meta-analysis. The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) program is used to assist analysis. As a result of the study, the overall effect size was 0.886 with a standard error of 0.092. The results of the follow-up analysis showed that the duration of the treatment was related to the use of mathematical software. It was found that the use of mathematical software given in the span of 0 - 4 weeks (effect size = 1.193) was more effective if carried out in more than 4 weeks (effect size = 0.535). Thus the Hawthorne effect influences the effectiveness of the use of mathematical software on students' mathematical abilities. This fact is considered by education practitioners in using mathematical software in the future.","[Tamur, M.] Univ Katolik Indonesia Santu Paulus Ruteng, Jl Jend A Yani 10, Ruteng 86511, Indonesia; [Kusumah, Y.

The research procedure consisted of collecting and selecting textbooks in mathematics instruction, selecting the topic of the subject, identifying and selecting problems, and reconstructing HOTS items. The item reconstruction phase included expert judgment and field trials. HOTS problem reconstruction was carried out through the improvement of questions in the textbooks so that the answers were not unique; the solution required several mathematical concepts and the use of other knowledge. The results showed that questions in mathematics textbooks could be reconstructed as HOTS questions. HOTS problem reconstruction can be achieved by changing the problem in such a way that it does not have a single solution, using a variety of mathematical concepts and other knowledge.","[Tanujaya, B.; Mumu, J.] Univ Papua, Jalan Gunung Salju, Manokwari 98314, Papua Barat, Indonesia","Tanujaya, B (corresponding author), Univ Papua, Jalan Gunung Salju, Manokwari 98314, Papua Barat, Indonesia.",b.tanujaya@unipa.ac.id,,,Faculty of Training and Training at the University of Papua,The authors would like to thank the Faculty of Training and Training at the University of Papua for supporting and funding this research.,"Abdullah A.

The LRS prototypes were installed in the clerestory window in the south-facing window testbed office and monitored under real sun and sky conditions. Workplane illuminance, daylight delivery efficiency (DDE) and visual comfort were evaluated. A number of simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the LRS and compare the results to the laboratory tests. The study shows that the specular properties of the slats provided significantly higher work plane illuminance and DDE. All systems showed an acceptable discomfort glare, or daylight glare probability (DGP) lower than 0.35. The comparison of the laboratory test and computer simulation was conducted using a Radiance tool. The results show that, for specular slats, the mkillum method with plastic material provided accurate work plane illuminance compared to the measurement.

Hence, building retrofit is considered as one of the most promising approaches to reduce those shares. However, reducing the energy load should not be an end in itself. The continuous integration of intermittent power sources in the electricity grid imposes new challenges to the supply-demand problem that might directly affect the retrofit process and vice-versa. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a model to analyze the demand flexibility potential of optimal retrofit solutions. Co-simulation and a rolling horizon approach are used to derive upper and lower electricity consumption profiles given some temperature comfort bands. Within those electricity bands, the feasible area provides insights on the extent by which the electricity consumption can be shifted within the comfort constraints. The method is applied to a building archetype. Results show that when the comfort constraints are relaxed the feasible area increases, e.g., up to five times for the case of enhancing the roof insulation, while building retrofit influences the electricity bands. Such a method could enhance the retrofit process and address both the emissions' and the supply-demand balancing problem.","[Thrampoulidis, Emmanouil; Orehounig, Kristina] Empa Duhendorf, Lab Urban Energy Syst, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Thrampoulidis, Emmanouil; Hug, Gabriela] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, EEH Power Syst Lab, Zurich, Switzerland","Thrampoulidis, E (corresponding author), Empa Duhendorf, Lab Urban Energy Syst, Dubendorf, Switzerland.;Thrampoulidis, E (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, EEH Power Syst Lab, Zurich, Switzerland.",,,,,,"Ascione F, 2019, APPL ENERG, V254, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.11370; ClauB J, 2017, CONTROL STRATEGIES ; D'hulst R, 2015, APPL ENERG, V155, P79, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.05.10; De Coninck R, 2016, APPL ENERG, V162, P653, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.10.11; Dostal Jiri, 2019, E3S Web of Conferences, V111, DOI 10.1051/e3sconf/20191110405; Hurtado LA, 2017, APPL ENERG, V195, P1047, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.00; Jensen SO, 2017, ENERG BUILDINGS, V155, P25, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.08.04; Johra H, 2019, J PHYS CONF SER, V1343, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1343/1/01206; Marasco DE, 2016, ENERG BUILDINGS, V128, P431, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.06.09; Murray P, 2020, ENERG BUILDINGS, V207, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.10956; Reynders G, 2018, ENERG BUILDINGS, V166, P372, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.02.04; Thrampoulidis E, 2021, APPL ENERG, V281, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.11602; Wu R, 2017, APPL ENERG, V190, P634, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.12.16",13,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12149,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012149,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100149,,"gold, Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2022-07-14,0.002662843097091356,1.0624620762077995e-13,0.04303912007876775,0.06757280478352341,0.04303912007876775

So, a teacher can teach mathematics kindly to students at school. Then, all prospective teachers have to like that to be ready to be a good facilitator in the process of learning mathematics at school and others. This study aimed to describe the critical thinking process expected by prospective teachers to students in solving mathematical problems based on critical thinking stages of Facione's theory. The research method used is descriptive research employing a qualitative approach. The subject of the study was the prospective mathematics teachers who were students of the Mathematics Study Program at Ibrahimy University, Situbondo, Indonesia. The data were collected by giving an essay test item to prospective teachers. The test was given to collect data related to the critical thinking process of prospective mathematics teachers. Moreover, the data collected through observations, tests, and interviews were analyzed and tested for their validity by using triangulation. The data analysis technique used is qualitative descriptive data analysis. The results of this study indicate that: (1) each of group subjects' expectations tend to have different expectations for students' critical thinking processes; (2) the high-group subject tend to expect that students follow and complete all of the critical thinking process stages according to Facione's theory; (3) the moderate and low-group subjects tend not to expect their students to follow and complete all of the critical thinking process stages according to Facione's theory; and (4) the percentage of indicators achievement of critical thinking processes expected by prospective teachers to students in solving problems based on Facione theory was revealed to be; Identify (57.14%), Define (50%), Enumerate (78.57%), Analyze (50%), List (39.29%), and Self-Correct (32.14%). The results of this study can serve as the fundamental to be discussed within the teacher's summit in finding out the critical thinking process expected by teachers towards the students, because it will have a positive impact both on themselves and their students.","[Tohir, M.; Maswar, M.] Univ Ibrahimy, Situbondo, Indonesia; [Mukhlis, M.] Inst Agama Islam Negeri Jember, Kabupaten Jember, Indonesia; [Sardjono, W.] Bina Nusantara Univ, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Selviyanti, E.] Politekn Negeri Jember, Negeri Jember, Indonesia","Tohir, M (corresponding author), Univ Ibrahimy, Situbondo, Indonesia.",matematohir@ibrahimy.ac.id,"Selviyanti, Erna/AAL-4695-2021; Tohir, Mohammad/AAE-8527-2019; Maswar, Maswar/AAB-2456-2020","Selviyanti, Erna/0000-0001-8161-9304; Tohir, Mohammad/0000-0001-8342-0972; Maswar, Maswar/0000-0002-1025-4667","Faculty of Education, Universitas Ibrahimy, Situbondo, Indonesia","We would like to thanks for support from Faculty of Education, Universitas Ibrahimy, Situbondo, Indonesia, 2020.","Abidin Z, 2019, ALIFMATIKA JURNAL PE, V1, P4; Afandi A, 2017, GAMMATH J SCI MATH E, V1, P; Amir M F, 2015, J MATH EDUCATOR NUSA, V1, P15; Asari A.

In this paper, human errors occurring in air handling units (AHUs) and variable air volume (VAV) thermal zones during design, construction, and operation phases are identified through a review of the literature. Then, the faults are divided into six main categories.

In particular, the vessel size and availability are considered. The study is performed with a life-span simulator, based on historical metocean data, walk-to-walk characterization based on a frequency domain hydrodynamic modelling of multibody systems, wind farm fault simulator (based on a catalogue of more than 1800 faults) and an algorithm to reproduce the O&M intelligence (i.e. sea transportation, workability, among others). The frequency domain model is applied on an hourly basis considering the specific significant wave height, peak period, peak enhancement factor, mean heading, directional spreading, and a wave-by-wave strategy is used to find if personnel transfer and workability criteria are met. The WindFloat Atlantic wind farm, located off the coast of Viana do Castello (Portugal), was chosen together with the TRL+ project semi-submersible platform and the 10MW turbine as a reference case. Different vessel logistics options are compared, including full vessel availability and several options of waiting times. The power availability changes among the different cases of study could be compared with the cost changes, optimizing the LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy) of the wind farm. The presented study is a valuable example of the potential of the proposed O&M simulation model as an optimization tool.","[Trueba, Virginia] Tech Univ Madrid UPM, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Rodriguez-Luis, Alvaro; Fernandez-Ruano, Sergio; Guanche, Raul] Univ Cantabria UC, Environm Hydraul Inst Cantabria IH Cantabria, Santander 39001, Spain","Rodriguez-Luis, A (corresponding author), Univ Cantabria UC, Environm Hydraul Inst Cantabria IH Cantabria, Santander 39001, Spain.",alvaro.rodriguezluis@unican.es,"Rodríguez-Luis, Álvaro/AAE-2709-2021","Rodríguez-Luis, Álvaro/0000-0002-7841-7688","research project: ACOPLE - Analisis del COmportamiento dinamico de PLataformas Eolicas flotantes para la optimizacion del diseno de aguas profundas [ENE2017-89716-R]; Ramon y Cajal Program of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [RYC-201723260]","This work is part of two research projects: i) ACOPLE - Analisis del COmportamiento dinamico de PLataformas Eolicas flotantes para la optimizacion del diseno de aguas profundas (grant agreement no.

Mathematics as one of the subjects that always exists in every level of education is very helpful for students in developing systematic and critical thinking, this is in accordance with the needs of students in industrial age 4.0. However, mathematics also has sufficient conditions, namely the need for an understanding of mathematical concepts. The reality found in schools in this study is the understanding of students' low concepts. Therefore, this study aims to improve the understanding of students' concepts through the application of Direct Instruction assisted by incomplete handouts in the topic of composition and inverse function. The research model used is Class Action Research according to Pelton. The research subjects were 21 students of grade XI in one of the West Jakarta High Schools. The data sources used are observation sheets and test sheets. Based on the results of the data analysis, it can be concluded that the implementation of Direct Instruction assisted by Incomplete Handouts can improve students' conceptual understanding.","[Tunde, J.] Sekolah Lentera Harapan, Jl Pacuan Kuda 5, Toraja Utara 91831, Sulawesi Selata, Indonesia; [Listiani, T.] Univ Pelita Harapan, Dept Pendidikan Matemat, Jl MH Thamrin Blvd 1100, Lippo Village Tangerang 15811, Indonesia","Listiani, T (corresponding author), Univ Pelita Harapan, Dept Pendidikan Matemat, Jl MH Thamrin Blvd 1100, Lippo Village Tangerang 15811, Indonesia.",tanti.listiani@uph.edu,,,,,"Amintoko G., 2017, SUPREMUM J MATH ED S, V1, P; Avis J., 2014, TEACHING LIFELONG L; Brummelen H V., 2009, BERJALAN DENGAN TUH; Edward J., 2016, FINAL WOR; Efita D., 2013, JUPE UNS, V2, P1; Fatqurhohman, 2016, MATEMATIKA, V4, P12; Huda M., 2014, MODEL MODEL PENGAJA; Jacobsen D A., 2009, METODE METODE PEMBEL, V; Jihad Asep, 2013, EVALUASI PEMBELAJAR; Kholidah I R., 2018, TRIHAYU JURNAL PENDI, V4, P42; Killpatrick J., 2001, ADDING IT HELPING C; Kristiana T G, 2017, JOHME J HOLISTIC MAT, V1, P; Lefudin, 2017, BEL PEMB DIL DENG M; Lestari K E., 2017, PENELITIAN PENDIDIK; Mills S, 2016, QUAL REP, V21, P54; Muslina, 2017, JURNAL CENDEKIA JURN, V1, P9; National Institute for Direct Instruction (NIFDI), GOLD STAND DIR INST; Ningtyas R., 2014, SCHOLARIA JURNAL PEN, V4, P4; Ormrod J E., 1999, HUM LEAR; Pelton R.

While research initiatives in the field of floating wind turbines have increased significantly, various aspects characterising floating turbine wakes are still not well understood. This paper applies a free-wake vortex model to derive the geometric characteristics of the wake of a surging rotor under axial and yawed rotor conditions. The study examines the influence of platform motion on the wake boundaries and centreline up to four rotor diameters downstream. It is shown that floating turbine wakes experience a higher degree of perturbation as compared to those of fixed turbines. This is highly dependent on the sea state and suggests the need to develop new analytical wake models for the wind industry that are able to account the effect of platform motion on wake behaviour.","[Valentin, J.; Sant, T.] Univ Malta, Fac Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Msida, Malta; [Valentin, J.] Ecole Natl Super Mecan & Aerotech ISAE ENSMA, Chasseneuil, France","Sant, T (corresponding author), Univ Malta, Fac Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Msida, Malta.",tonio.sant@um.edu.mt,,,,,"Archer CL, 2018, APPL ENERG, V226, P1187, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.08; Bastankhah M, 2016, J FLUID MECH, V806, P506, DOI 10.1017/jfm.2016.59; Bossanyi E, 2018, J PHYS CONF SER, V1037, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1037/3/03201; Farrugia R, 2016, RENEW ENERG, V86, P770, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2015.08.06; Gocmen T, 2016, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V60, P752, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2016.01.11; Haans W, 2005, J SOL ENERG-T ASME, V127, P456, DOI 10.1115/1.203709; Jason Jonkman, 2009, DEFINITION 5 MW REFE, DOI DOI 10.2172/94742; Jimenez A, 2010, WIND ENERGY, V13, P559, DOI 10.1002/we.38; Lignarolo LEM, 2015, J FLUID MECH, V781, P467, DOI 10.1017/jfm.2015.47; Micallef D, 2014, 5 PHD SEM WIND EN E; O'Brien JM, 2017, PROG AEROSP SCI, V92, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.paerosci.2017.05.00; Porte-Agel F, 2020, BOUND-LAY METEOROL, V174, P1, DOI 10.1007/s10546-019-00473-; Qian GW, 2018, ENERGIES, V11, DOI 10.3390/en1103066; Quick J, 2020, WIND ENERGY SCI, V5, P413, DOI 10.5194/wes-5-413-202; Sant T, 2019, 2 ASME INT OFFSHOR; Sant T, 2006, WIND ENERGY, V9, P549, DOI 10.1002/we.20; Sant T, 2016, J SOL ENERG-T ASME, V138, DOI 10.1115/1.403268; Sebastian T, 2012, RENEW ENERG, V46, P269, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2012.03.03; Shen X, 2018, ENERGY, V145, P793, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2017.12.10; Tran TT, 2018, WIND ENERGY, V21, P70, DOI 10.1002/we.214",20,0,0,4,4,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2018.0,,,,,,,,12044,10.1088/1742-6596/2018/1/012044,,11,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Engineering, Mechanical",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BS3LW,WOS:000713005900044,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.004096681687832855,0.004358430881881357,0.02629484008378923,0.12505122950819672,0.025596215875302725

Building loads and solar potentials are assessed using bottom-up models; the MES design is determined using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model (energy hub). A mixed-use district of 170,000 m(2) floor area including office, residential, retail, education, etc. is studied under current and future climate conditions in Switzerland and Singapore. Our findings are consistent with previous studies, which indicate that DR generally leads to smaller system capacities due to peak shaving. We further show that in both the Swiss and Singapore context, cost and emissions of the MES can be reduced significantly with DR. Applying DR, the optimal area for BIPV placement increases only marginally for Singapore (similar to 1%), whereas for Switzerland, the area is even reduced by 2-8%, depending on the carbon target. In conclusion, depending on the context, DR can have a noticeable impact on optimal MES and BIPV capacities and should thus be considered in the design of future, energy efficient districts.","[Waibel, Christoph; Hsieh, Shanshan; Schluter, Arno] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Architecture & Bldg Syst AS, Zurich, Switzerland; [Waibel, Christoph; Schluter, Arno] CREATE, Future Cities Lab Singapore, ETH Ctr, Zurich Hub, Zurich, Switzerland","Waibel, C (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Architecture & Bldg Syst AS, Zurich, Switzerland.;Waibel, C (corresponding author), CREATE, Future Cities Lab Singapore, ETH Ctr, Zurich Hub, Zurich, Switzerland.",waibel@arch.ethz.ch,"Schlueter, Arno/CAF-1531-2022","Schlueter, Arno/0000-0003-4999-2218","National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme; Swiss Federal Office of Energy [SI/501810-01]","We would like to thank Patrick Schmid from Swiss Interactive AG for sharing a detailed 3D model of the Suurstoffi areal.

A validation against measured data of PV installations from 16 roofs in the Swiss Canton of Aargau shows that the existing PV area is detected accurately, while the hourly profiles overestimate the PV production, with higher errors in winter than in summer. These errors result in a mean overestimation of the annual PV production by 16%, assuming a triangular panel placement at low tilt (15 degrees) on flat roofs.","[Walch, Alina; Castello, Roberto; Scartezzini, Jean-Louis] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Ruedisueli, Martin] Empa, Urban Energy Syst Lab, Dubendorf, Switzerland","Walch, A (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Solar Energy & Bldg Phys Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland.",alina.walch@epfl.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) under the National Research Program 75 (Big Data),The authors thank IBW for providing the measured PV data.

Due to the long-term operation of buildings, future developments and uncertainties need to be considered, which calls for assessing the robustness of retrofit decisions. Existing studies propose robustness metrics for decisions under deep uncertainty to be coupled with a scenario-based simulation approach. We review these metrics and present a simulation approach that includes current and future operational energy, emissions, and costs. We apply the seven identified metrics to retrofit decisions of a multifamily house located in Zurich, where future scenarios in terms of climate, occupancy, decarbonization, and cost development are included. The metrics are based on different assumptions and positions towards risk. We further find that the discriminatory power is different, confirming the Minimax Regret metric to be most suitable for the building context when looking at individual buildings. For the case study, we find that deep retrofit seems to be a robust decision from an environmental perspective. From a cost perspective, the electrification of the heating system with heat pumps and the installation of PV without a complete envelope retrofit proves to be most robust.","[Walker, Linus; Kuhn, Alexandra; Hischier, Illias; Schlueter, Arno] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Technol Architecture, Chair Architecture & Bldg Syst, Stefano Franscini Pl 1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Walker, L (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Technol Architecture, Chair Architecture & Bldg Syst, Stefano Franscini Pl 1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",walker@arch.ethz.ch,"Schlueter, Arno/CAF-1531-2022","Schlueter, Arno/0000-0003-4999-2218",,,"Cozza S, 2020, ENERG POLICY, V137, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2019.11108; Frei B, 2017, ENRGY PROCED, V122, P421, DOI 10.1016/j.egypro.2017.07.42; Gang WJ, 2015, SCI TECHNOL BUILT EN, V21, P789, DOI 10.1080/23744731.2015.105665; Holmgren FW., 2018, J OPEN SOURCE SOFTWA, V3, P884, DOI 10.21105/joss.0088; Homaei S, 2020, APPL ENERG, V267, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.11486; Jayathissa P, 2017, APPL ENERG, V202, P726, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.05.08; Jayathissa P., 2020, RC BUILDING SIMULAT; Kotireddy R, 2019, ENERG BUILDINGS, V202, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.10936; Kotireddy R, 2018, APPL ENERG, V212, P428, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.12.06; Kuhn A, THESIS ETH; McPhail C, 2018, EARTHS FUTURE, V6, P169, DOI 10.1002/2017EF00064; Nik VM, 2015, ENRGY PROCED, V78, P955, DOI 10.1016/j.egypro.2015.11.03; Nik VM, 2015, ENERG BUILDINGS, V88, P262, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.11.01; Picard T, 2020, ENERG BUILDINGS, V224, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2020.11025; Rock M, 2020, APPL ENERG, V258, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.11410; Rysanek AM, 2013, ENERG BUILDINGS, V57, P324, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.10.02",16,0,0,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12150,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012150,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100150,,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-07-14,0.0032773453502662844,1.6313431622441464e-15,0.006136209756145463,0.05251834161664408,0.006136209756145463

The trial was conducted online, after learning the exercises were given evidentiary problems through scaffolding worksheets with the topic Group. To find out the ability to construct a proof, test, and interview are given based on the student's proof answers. Interview guidelines are prepared to refer to indicators of construction proof. For this reason, this research is qualitative descriptive research. The research subjects were students of Unirow Tuban Mathematics education who took the Algebra Structure course. The design of scaffolding worksheets refers to the mapping of construction evidence indicators, and the level of scaffolding developed by [32]. The results showed that the ability of students in the initial steps of proof, proof of flow, using related concepts, the argument of proof, and the language of proof had very good improvement. So the ability of students to prove group problems after using scaffolding worksheets increased.","[Warli; Rahayu, P.] Univ PGRI Ronggolawe Tuban, Math Educ, Jl Manunggal 61, Tuban, East Java, Indonesia; [Cintamulya, I] Univ PGRI Ronggolawe Tuban, Biol Educ, Jl Manunggal 61, Tuban, East Java, Indonesia","Warli (corresponding author), Univ PGRI Ronggolawe Tuban, Math Educ, Jl Manunggal 61, Tuban, East Java, Indonesia.",warli@unirow.ac.id,,,Deputy for Research and Development Strengthening of the Ministry of Research and Technology/National Research and Innovation Agency,"The author would like to thank the Deputy for Research and Development Strengthening of the Ministry of Research and Technology/National Research and Innovation Agency, which has given credence and fully supports this research fund.","Anghileri J, 2006, J MATH TEACH EDUC, V9, P33, DOI 10.1007/s10857-006-9005-; Bakirci H, 2011, PROCD SOC BEHV, V15, P1462, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.03.31; Belland BR, 2008, ETR&D-EDUC TECH RES, V56, P401, DOI 10.1007/s11423-007-9074-; Cho KL, 2002, ETR&D-EDUC TECH RES, V50, P5, DOI 10.1007/BF0250502; Crespo MAG, 2004, INT J SCI EDUC, V26, P1325, DOI 10.1080/095006904200020535; Duval R., 2002, P INT C MATH UNDERST, P6; Gabel M, 2017, EDUC STUD MATH, V96, P187, DOI 10.1007/s10649-016-9746-; Hanna G, 2007, ONGOING VALUE PROOF, P; Hanna G, 2008, ZDM-MATH EDUC, V40, P329, DOI 10.1007/s11858-008-0073-; Harel G., 1998, CBMS RES COLLEGIATE, V7, P23; Healy L, 2000, J RES MATH EDUC, V31, P396, DOI 10.2307/74965; Isnarto I, 2014, INT J EDUC RES, V2, P21; Kibar ZB, 2010, PROCD SOC BEHV, V2, P733, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.03.09; Knapp J, 2005, LEARNING PROVE ORDE; Lowe JR, 2013, ACTA PAEDIATR, V102, P72, DOI 10.1111/apa.1203; Milles B M, 2014, QUALITATIVE DATA AN; Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia, CIRC ONL LEARN WOR; Miyazaki M, 2009, PROOF PROVING MATH E, V2, P7; Miyazaki M, 2015, ZDM-MATH EDUC, V47, P1211, DOI 10.1007/s11858-015-0712-; Moore R.C., 1994, EDUC STUD MATH, V27, DOI [DOI 10.1007/BF01273731, https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01273731; Organization W H, 2020, WHO DIR GEN OP REM ; Principles N, 2000, STANDARDS SCH MAT; Puntambekar S, 2005, EDUC PSYCHOL-US, V40, P1, DOI 10.1207/s15326985ep4001_; Roehler L R, 1997, LEARN INST; Saye JW, 2002, ETR&D-EDUC TECH RES, V50, P77, DOI 10.1007/BF0250502; Selden A, 2003, J RES MATH EDUC, V34, P4, DOI 10.2307/3003469; Selden A, 2010, INT J MATH EDUC SCI, V41, P199, DOI 10.1080/0020739090338865; Simons KD, 2007, INSTR SCI, V35, P41, DOI 10.1007/s11251-006-9002-; Sowder L., 2003, CANADIAN J MATH SCI, V3, P251, DOI 10/1080/1492615030955656; Stylianides AJ, 2007, J RES MATH EDUC, V38, P289, DOI 10.2307/3003486; Stylianides GJ, 2009, J RES MATH EDUC, V40, P31; Trewet CB, 2013, RES SOC ADMIN PHARM, V9, P215, DOI 10.1016/j.sapharm.2012.06.00; van de Pol J, 2015, INSTR SCI, V43, P615, DOI 10.1007/s11251-015-9351-; Weber, 2010, INVESTIGATIONS MATH, V3, P1, DOI [10.1080/24727466.2010.11790298, DOI 10.1080/24727466.2010.11790298; Weber K., 2001, EDUC STUD MATH, V48, P101, DOI [10.1023/A:1015535614355, DOI 10.1023/A:1015535614355; Weber K, 2008, J RES MATH EDUC, V39, P43; Weber K, 2010, MATH THINK LEARN, V12, P306, DOI 10.1080/10986065.2010.49546; WOOD D, 1976, J CHILD PSYCHOL PSYC, V17, P89, DOI 10.1111/j.1469-7610.1976.tb00381.; Zazkis R, 2008, ZDM-MATH EDUC, V40, P131, DOI 10.1007/s11858-007-0065-",39,0,0,1,3,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,1832.0,,,,,,,,12055,10.1088/1742-6596/1832/1/012055,,13,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Physics, Multidisciplinary",Mathematics; Physics,BS0UA,WOS:000684374700055,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.005973349670699953,8.952799708502918e-12,0.019382196450065992,0.10605740647487857,0.016687732211869723

We explore this trade-off with multiobjective optimization (MOO). Specifically, we benchmark seven MOO algorithms on two test problems with different, parametric typologies: courtyard and high-rise. For both problems, we aim to maximize Floor Area Ratio and the simulation-based Context Exposure Index, a novel metric based on the Israeli green building code. The high-rise emerges as the better performing typology, and HypE, SPEA2, and RBFMOpt as the most efficient and robust MOO algorithms.","[Wortmann, Thomas] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Computat Design & Construct, Dept Architecture & Urban Planning, Stuttgart, Germany; [Natanian, Jonathan] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Architecture, Chair Bldg Technol & Climate Respons Design, Munich, Germany; [Natanian, Jonathan] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Haifa, Israel","Wortmann, T (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Computat Design & Construct, Dept Architecture & Urban Planning, Stuttgart, Germany.",thomas.wortmann@icd.uni-stuttgart.de,"Wortmann, Thomas/K-5087-2019","Wortmann, Thomas/0000-0002-5604-1624","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [EXC 2120/1 -390831618]","The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) partially supported this paper under Germany ' s Excellence Strategy -EXC 2120/1 -390831618.","Acciarini G, 2020, IEEE C EVOL COMPUTA; Audet C, 2021, EUR J OPER RES, V292, P397, DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2020.11.01; Biscani F, 2020, J OPEN SOURCE SOFTW, V5, P2338, DOI [10.21105/joss.02338, DOI 10.21105/JOSS.02338; Costa A, 2018, MATH PROGRAM COMPUT, V10, P597, DOI 10.1007/s12532-018-0144-; De Luca F, 2020, ECAADE PROC, P5; Deb K, 2002, IEEE T EVOLUT COMPUT, V6, P182, DOI 10.1109/4235.99601; Guneralp B, 2017, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V114, P8945, DOI 10.1073/pnas.160603511; Hason S, 2016, ISRAEL 2048 STRATEG; Li XD, 2003, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V2723, P3; Natanian J, 2021, CISBA; Natanian J, 2021, ENERG BUILDINGS, V240, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.11091; Roudsari MS, 2013, BUILDING SIMULATION 2013: 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL BUILDING PERFORMANCE SIMULATION ASSOCIATION, P312; Shi ZM, 2017, BUILD ENVIRON, V121, P119, DOI 10.1016/j.buildenv.2017.05.00; Vierlinger R., 2012, OCTOPU; Wortmann T., 2020, P S SIM ARCH URB DES, P20; Wortmann T., 2020, RE ANTHR DESIGN AG; Wortmann T, 2019, J COMPUT DES ENG, V6, P414, DOI 10.1016/j.jcde.2018.09.00; Wortmann T, 2017, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 22ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER-AIDED ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN RESEARCH IN ASIA (CAADRIA 2017), P28; Zitzler E., 2001, EVOLUTIONARY METHODS, P10",19,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12066,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012066,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100066,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.0038918476034412127,4.0430840315380507e-07,0.010069326688360882,0.10002048760499897,0.010021777945313823

This study examines possible energy planning pathways for the district through the development of a long-term optimization model and a range of energy scenarios until 2050. The scenarios explore different CO2 emission reduction strategies and technology mixes/parameters. Results suggest which low-carbon energy conversion technologies and efficiency measures should be adopted by the district alongside supportive local policies and targets. Photovoltaic (PV) and waste energy converters are two renewable energy technologies which are taken up at maximum possible rates in the evaluated scenarios to reduce long-term CO2 emissions. Once local renewable resources are exhausted, natural gas-based combined-cycle plants (CCP) and combined heat and power plants (CHP) are required to further reduce emissions, alongside efficiency measures in the built environment. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies also demonstrate the potential to drastically reduce emissions; however, local feasibility studies are needed to support their implementation. Study results prescribe renewable energy share and CO2 emission reduction targets until 2050 for the district. Appropriate local policy and planning targets should also be accompanied by supplementary support studies, including local feasibility, renewable energy resource, and demand-side management studies.","[Yazdanie, Mashael; Zhou, Chenyu] Empa, Urban Energy Syst Lab, Uberlandstr 129, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland","Yazdanie, M (corresponding author), Empa, Urban Energy Syst Lab, Uberlandstr 129, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",mashael.yazdanie@empa.ch; chezhou@student.ethz.ch,,,,,"[Anonymous], 2020, ECONOMIS; China Power, 2019, ANAL HEATING SITUAT; Fuentes E, 2018, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V81, P1530, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.22; GB National Standard, 2019, ASSESSMENT STANDAR; IEA-ETSAP, 2014, ENERGY SUPPLY TECHN; Kannan R, 2013, ENVIRON MODEL ASSESS, V18, P325, DOI 10.1007/s10666-012-9346-; Liang Z., 2019, 5 TRENDS CHINESE PO; Muschner C., 2020, OPEN SOURCE ENERGY ; Solcast API Toolkit, 2020, HIST TM; Statista Research Department, 2020, COUNTRIES LARGEST P; World Bank Group, 2020, URBAN POPULATION TO; Zhang X, 2017, NAT COMMUN, V8, P1, DOI [10.1038/ncomms14542, 10.1038/s41467-017-01968-5",12,0,0,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12109,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012109,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100109,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2022-07-14,0.0024580090126997134,3.762183849208571e-09,0.004501733640823664,0.09682665608885363,0.004501733640823664

It is a major challenge to exploit this Big Data in order to characterise electricity use patterns and to support demand response policies. In this paper, we perform a featured-based cluster analysis on nine building archetypes (hospitals, schools, offices, hotels, flats, houses etc.) to identify electricity use patterns. Then, four metrics are developed, which are entropy, load curviness, peak intensity and index of hourly ramp rates, to measure these archetypes' suitability to be involved in demand response schemes. A significant difference in electricity use patterns between the archetypes is found, as well as among the seasons and days of the week. We present a number of metrics for each archetype to establish which type of archetype should be prioritised for demand response programmes in terms of peak management, ramp rates as well as demand flexibility. A key finding of our study is that households offer more demand flexibility than the non-domestic sector and should therefore be incentivized to participate in dynamic electricity tariffs.","[Yilmaz, Selin] Univ Geneva, Chair Energy Efficiency, Inst Environm Sci, Uni Carl Vogt, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; Univ Geneva, Dept FA Forel Environm & Aquat Sci, Uni Carl Vogt, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland","Yilmaz, S (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Chair Energy Efficiency, Inst Environm Sci, Uni Carl Vogt, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",Selin.Yilmaz@unige.ch,,,,,"IEA, 2017, EN TECHN PERSP 201; Jensen SO, 2017, ENERG BUILDINGS, V155, P25, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.08.04; Juneja S., 2010, JAPANESE J CLIN HEMA, V54, P7; Pedregosa F, 2011, J MACH LEARN RES, V12, P282; Torriti J, 2010, ENERGY, V35, P1575, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2009.05.02; Ward J., 2010, SMART TARIFFS HOUSEH, P9; Yilmaz S, 2019, ENERGY, V180, P665, DOI 10.1016/j.energy.2019.05.12; Yilmaz S, 2019, J PHYS CONF SER, V1343, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1343/1/01204",8,0,0,3,4,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12021,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012021,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100021,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.0016386726751331422,1.6073983190023844e-11,0.04606765139781952,0.07759552419098481,0.04606765139781952

This study aims to analyze the variables that form the mathematical resilience of high school students. The subjects in this study were 110 high school students. The method used in this study is a quantitative descriptive method using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) techniques. Each respondent is given a mathematical resilience scale consisting of 25 statements which are the variables forming the mathematical resilience. The findings in this study indicate that seven main indicators that form mathematical resilience can be formulated in high school students. Each indicator is composed of several variables which are the constituent variables of the mathematical resilience ability.

The purposive sampling technique was used to determine 2 research samples. The instrument used in this study was HOTS which consisted of 24 multiple choice items that had met validity and reliability criteria. The data of students' HOTS was obtained from pre-test and post-test scores. The analysis technique was in the form of gain and effect size test as well as prerequisite test and hypothesis testing. The analysis results showed differences in the experimental class average post-test scores were 66.52 +/- SD 17.69 and the control class was 42.01 +/- SD 22.55, the experimental class gain score was 0.58 (medium) and the control class was 0.24 (low) and the experimental class effect size was 2.39 (high) and the control class was 0.53 (medium). The result of normality and homogeneity test of HOTS data showed normal and homogeneous results so that it could be proceed with hypothesis testing through t test. The result of the t-test analysis with a significant value (2 tailed) was 0.00 less than 0.05 or there were significant differences. It can be inferred that HOTS taught by students through blended learning is better than conventional models.","[Yusuf, I; Widyaningsih, S.

However, the high cost of production, operation, sun-tracking system, and the environmental sensitivity made them unprofitable for urban contexts. Lenses are more efficient and effective, but the complexity of manufacturing made them less used in sustainable architecture. This research proposes a liquid lens to be integrated into buildings' envelope and compared with a PTC based on the energy production and reduced CO2 emissions over a year. The output energy, temperature, and efficiency of concentrator are obtained by the physics of light equations, and Ray-tracing software simulation. The results show that water lenses are at least 6% more efficient, their output temperature is higher, their underneath greenhouse effect made them less sensitive to the environment, and are still productive in high latitudes where PTCs are not operative.

Integrating solar energy equipment into urban buildings poses many challenges, such as uncertainties and the complexity of urban built agglomeration. Due to the time-consuming solar energy potential assessment process and lack of knowledge of urban actors, a reliable framework is required to predict buildings' solar energy potential. This research presents a comprehensive machine learning data processing framework to predict output energy of Water Lenses (WL) based on buildings specifications and relationship to the neighbourhood. The research used a raw dataset consisting of 7000 sample buildings in different situations by applying 12 years of climatic conditions in Tallinn, Estonia. The results were entered into a Supervised Machine Learning process and the Gaussian Naive Bayes technique was used for classification of building features to be implemented with solar systems. Finally, the process was measured by a confusion matrix that showed 80% accuracy of ML output predictions in the urban context.","[Zarrinkafsh, Hamidreza] Univ Tehran, Sch Architecture, Tehran, Iran; [Eslamirad, Nasim] Tallinn Univ Technol, Smart City Ctr Excellence Finest Twins, Tallinn, Estonia; [De Luca, Francesco] Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia","Zarrinkafsh, H (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Sch Architecture, Tehran, Iran.",zarinkafsh@ut.ac.ir,,,European Commission through the H2020 project Finest Twins [856602],This work has been supported by the European Commission through the H2020 project Finest Twins (grant No. 856602).,"Anton I, 2003, PROG PHOTOVOLTAICS, V11, P387, DOI 10.1002/pip.50; Assouline D, 2017, SOL ENERGY, V141, P278, DOI 10.1016/j.solener.2016.11.04; De Luca F, 2021, ENERG BUILDINGS, V238, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.11083; Ertugrul OF, INT SMART GRID C FAI, P; Eslamirad N., 2021, C 12 ANN S SIMULATI; Eslamirad N, 2020, SMART SUSTAIN BUILT, V9, P361, DOI 10.1108/SASBE-03-2019-002; Good CS, 2014, ENRGY PROCED, V58, P166, DOI 10.1016/j.egypro.2014.10.42; Jakubiec JA, 2013, SOL ENERGY, V93, P127, DOI 10.1016/j.solener.2013.03.02; Kabir E, 2018, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V82, P894, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2017.09.09; Khan S, 2018, 2018 THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FOG AND MOBILE EDGE COMPUTING (FMEC), P283, DOI 10.1109/FMEC.2018.836408; Kim SG, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/su1105150; Luo HD, 2019, FUTURE GENER COMP SY, V101, P444, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2019.06.03; Mondol AS, 2015, OPT EXPRESS, V23, pA692, DOI 10.1364/OE.23.00A69; Mutule A, 2018, LATV J PHYS TECH SCI, V55, P3, DOI 10.2478/lpts-2018-000; Pavlovic Sasa, 2014, OPTICAL SIMULATION S, P21; Peters Sascha, 2019, MAT PROGR, P22; Qudsi Dania, 2019, EXPT STUDY WATER LE; Ryyan A., 2018, J CLEAN ENERGY TECHN, V; Sharma G, 2011, INT CONF ACOUST SPEE, P529, DOI 10.1109/smartgridcomm.2011.610237; SUGIURA N, 1993, APPL OPTICS, V32, P4181, DOI 10.1364/AO.32.00418; Voyant C, 2017, RENEW ENERG, V105, P569, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2016.12.09; Walch A, 2020, APPL ENERG, V262, DOI 10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.11440; Zarrinkafsh H, 2017, IR9524",23,1,1,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2021.0,2042.0,,,,,,,,12022,10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012022,,6,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Regional & Urban Planning,Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Public Administration,BS4ZU,WOS:000724676100022,,gold,,,2022-07-14,0.004711183941007784,1.2788582432804867e-09,0.01736001865374245,0.0960834481401299,0.017161384304773295

The inquiry-based laboratory practice of enzyme kinetics has four stages to keep the students' effort on track: pre-lab activities, an in-lab discussion, in-lab work and a post-lab assignment. This study used a quasi-experimental method, with single group pretest-posttest design. The subjects of this study involve 55 students enrolled in biochemistry practicum course from the sixth semester of chemistry study program. The critical thinking ability test instrument consist of 12 reasonable multiple choices question that includes two indicators of critical thinking ability i.e. basic support and inference and also supported by student worksheet. Data analysis of students' score test using t-test. There was a statistically significant improvement of students' critical thinking skills (symp.sig 0.000). Furthermore to see the increase in each students' critical thinking indicator, N-gain is calculated. Based on implementation of the inquiry-based laboratory, it is reported that students' critical thinking skills improved in medium category and also for students' critical thinking indicator of 'inference'. But in the students' critical thinking indicator of `basic support' they get high category.","[Zikrina, A.; Liliasari; Supriyanti, F. M.
