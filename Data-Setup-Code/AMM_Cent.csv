Classical cardiovascular risk factors and systemic inflammation may play a role in this process, but the major determinants in elderly women have not yet been established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between classical cardiovascular risk factors, C-reactive protein and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) in elderly non-diabetic women, without overt cardiovascular disease. Methods: Aortic PWV was measured non-invasively using an oscillometric device in 104 elderly women, mean age 69.7 +/- 6.4 years. Laboratory parameters of lipid and glucose metabolism and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were also evaluated. Results: Aortic PWV independently correlated with hsCRP (beta=0.22, p=0.01), systolic blood pressure (beta=0.23, p=0.009), abdominal circumference (beta=0.24, p=0.007) and age (beta=0.18, p=0.03). Aortic PWV was increased in hypertensive compared with normotensive subjects (10.3 +/- 2.3 vs. 9.0 +/- 1.6, p=0.006) and in obese compared to non-obese women (10.7 +/- 1.9 vs. 9.6 +/- 2.2, p=0.01). Conclusion: In elderly non-diabetic women, age, abdominal obesity, systolic blood pressure and hsCRP, are the most important determinants of aortic PWV. Body weight loss, efficient control of blood pressure and decrease in systemic inflammation may reduce arterial stiffness in this high cardiovascular risk population.","[Albu, Adriana; Fodor, Daniela] Iuliu Hatieganu Univ Med & Pharm, Dept Internal Med 2, 2-4 Clinicilor Str, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Bondor, Cosmina I.] Iuliu Hatieganu Univ Med & Pharm, Med Informat & Biostat Dept, Cluj Napoca, Romania","Albu, A (corresponding author), Iuliu Hatieganu Univ Med & Pharm, Dept Internal Med 2, 2-4 Clinicilor Str, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",,"Bondor, Cosmina Ioana/V-8815-2019; albu, adriana/D-4480-2016",,,,"Alecu C, 2006, J HUM HYPERTENS, V20, P749, DOI 10.1038/sj.jhh.100207; Araujo F, 2004, INT J CARDIOL, V97, P433, DOI 10.1016/j.ijcard.2003.10.02; Assuncao LGS, 2012, BRAZ J MED BIOL RES, V45, P1284, DOI 10.1590/S0100-879X201200750015; Baulmann J, 2008, J HYPERTENS, V26, P523, DOI 10.1097/HJH.0b013e3282f314f; Boutouyrie P, 2002, HYPERTENSION, V39, P10, DOI 10.1161/hy0102.09903; Budimir D, 2012, MED SCI MONITOR, V18, pCR65, DOI 10.12659/MSM.88245; Chahal HS, 2007, J PATHOL, V211, P173, DOI 10.1002/path.211; Charakida M, 2012, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V60, P2643, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2012.08.101; Corden B, 2013, HYPERTENSION, V61, P1322, DOI 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.0117; Coutinho T, 2014, CAN J CARDIOL, V30, P756, DOI 10.1016/j.cjca.2014.03.02; Fantin F, 2010, J HYPERTENS, V28, P333, DOI 10.1097/HJH.0b013e328333d23; Ford LB, 2010, J HYPERTENS, V28, pE22; Genuth S, 2003, DIABETES CARE, V26, P316; Horvath IG, 2010, J HYPERTENS, V28, P2068, DOI 10.1097/HJH.0b013e32833c8a1; Jia GH, 2015, FRONT PHYSIOL, V6, DOI 10.3389/fphys.2015.0023; Lakatta EG, 2003, CIRCULATION, V107, P139, DOI 10.1161/01.CIR.0000048892.83521.5; Laurent S, 2006, EUR HEART J, V27, P2588, DOI 10.1093/eurheartj/ehl25; Lavie CJ, 2009, AM J MED SCI, V338, P486, DOI 10.1097/MAJ.0b013e3181c61b6; Lechleitner M, 2008, GERONTOLOGY, V54, P253, DOI 10.1159/00016173; Lee HY, 2010, CIRC J, V74, P2257, DOI 10.1253/circj.CJ-10-091; Mackey RH, 2002, AM J HYPERTENS, V15, P16, DOI 10.1016/S0895-7061(01)02228-; Mahmud A, 2005, HYPERTENSION, V46, P1118, DOI 10.1161/01.HYP.0000185463.27209.b; Mattace-Raso FUS, 2004, ATHEROSCLEROSIS, V176, P111, DOI 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2004.04.01; Park JB, 2010, 23 SCI M INT SOC HY; Park S, 2012, YONSEI MED J, V53, P258, DOI 10.3349/ymj.2012.53.2.25; Pasceri V, 2000, CIRCULATION, V102, P216; Recio-Rodriguez JI, 2012, BMC CARDIOVASC DISOR, V12, DOI 10.1186/1471-2261-12-; Safar ME, 2013, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V61, P12, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2012.01.08; Scuteri A, 2012, ATHEROSCLEROSIS, V221, P189, DOI 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.11.04; Strandberg TE, 2000, ARTERIOSCL THROM VAS, V20, P1057, DOI 10.1161/01.ATV.20.4.105; Sutton-Tyrrell K, 2001, HYPERTENSION, V38, P429, DOI 10.1161/01.HYP.38.3.42; Trachet B, 2010, ANN BIOMED ENG, V38, P876, DOI 10.1007/s10439-010-9945-; Venugopal SK, 2002, CIRCULATION, V106, P1439, DOI 10.1161/01.CIR.0000033116.22237.F; Vermeersch SJ, 2008, J HYPERTENS, V26, P1411, DOI 10.1097/HJH.0b013e3282ffac0; Vlachopoulos C, 2010, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V55, P1318, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2009.10.06; Weisbrod RM, 2013, HYPERTENSION, V62, P1105, DOI 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.0174; Won KB, 2015, DIABETOL METAB SYNDR, V7, DOI 10.1186/1758-5996-7-; Woodard GA, 2011, MENOPAUSE, V18, P1291, DOI 10.1097/gme.0b013e31821f81c; Zieman SJ, 2005, ARTERIOSCL THROM VAS, V25, P932, DOI 10.1161/01.ATV.0000160548.78317.2",39,2,2,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,625.0,630,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_96,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000001,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0040289256198347105,1.1635956663480261e-20,0.007836233167315455,0.06200636718274583,0.007836233167315455

Through the genetic profile we calculated, by an algorithm, the TGS (Total Genetic Score) in both groups; this idea comes from the concept that it's better to personalized workout based on athlete genetic profile. Identifying specifically performance demands (based on the metabolism system used during performance, aerobic or anaerobic) and paying attention to the performance-enhancing genes and their polymorphisms, is important focus it in order to build personalized and successful training for every single athlete. Materials and methods: We considered two groups of professional athletes: 21 basketball players and 21 soccer players both involved in professional championships. For the genetic analysis a saliva sample was taken from athletes, and the polymorphisms were analysed: ACE; ACTN3; CK-MM; PPAR alpha; PPAR gamma C1; NRF2 A/G; NRF2 C/T. Each genotype was scored from 0 to 2 depending on whether they were more related to resistance or power activity. The sum of these scores generates the total TGS for each athlete and was compared both for resistance and power. Results: Our results indicate that professional basketball players have a power-related TGS higher than the resistance-related conversely the football players, that have a resistance-related TGS greater than power-related one. Conclusion: TGS can be a useful tool to identify the genetic predisposition of the athlete starting from the genetic analysis of some PEPs, regardless of the type and number of genes analysed.","[Amato, Alessandra; Messina, Giuseppe; Contro, Valentina; Sacco, Alessia; Proia, Patrizia] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Psicol Pedag & Formaz, Palermo, Italy","Messina, G (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Psicol Pedag & Formaz, Palermo, Italy.",giuseppe.messina17@unipa.it,,"Proia, Patrizia/0000-0002-0326-5560",,,"Ahmetov II, 2013, J PHYSIOL SCI, V63, P79, DOI 10.1007/s12576-012-0233-; Alves Cleber Rene, 2018, J RENIN-ANGIO-ALDO S, P; Amato A., 2017, Human Movement, V18, P1; Bianco A., 2016, ASIAN J SPORTS MED, V; Bruni F, 2010, J BIOL CHEM, V285, P3939, DOI 10.1074/jbc.M109.04430; Charlier R, 2017, PHYSIOL GENOMICS, V49, P160, DOI 10.1152/physiolgenomics.00085.201; Collins FS, 2003, SCIENCE, V300, P286, DOI 10.1126/science.108456; Contro V, 2018, EUR J TRANSL MYOL, V28, P87, DOI 10.4081/ejtm.2018.718; Egorova ES, 2014, J SPORT SCI, V32, P1286, DOI 10.1080/02640414.2014.89885; Fedotovskaia O N, 2012, Fiziol Cheloveka, V38, P10; He Z, 2007, INT J SPORTS MED, V28, P717, DOI 10.1055/s-2007-96491; Hughes DC, 2011, J SPORT SCI, V29, P1425, DOI 10.1080/02640414.2011.59777; Jones N, 2016, BIOL SPORT, V33, P117, DOI 10.5604/20831862.119821; Lopez-Leon S, 2016, BIOL SPORT, V33, P3, DOI 10.5604/20831862.118017; Lucia A, 2005, J APPL PHYSIOL, V99, P344, DOI 10.1152/japplphysiol.00037.200; Ma F, 2013, PLOS ONE, V8, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.005468; Maciejewska A, 2012, J SPORT SCI, V30, P101, DOI 10.1080/02640414.2011.62370; Ostrander EA, 2009, ANNU REV GENOM HUM G, V10, P407, DOI 10.1146/annurev-genom-082908-15005; Patti A, 2016, J PHYS THER SCI, V28, P72, DOI 10.1589/jpts.28.7; Proia P, 2012, J SPORT MED PHYS FIT, V52, P10; Proia P, 2014, OPEN ACCESS J SPORTS, V5, P273, DOI 10.2147/OAJSM.S6833; Rankinen T, 2010, MED SCI SPORT EXER, V42, P835, DOI 10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181d86ce; Wang G, 2013, MED SCI SPORT EXER, V45, P892, DOI 10.1249/MSS.0b013e31827c501; Yang N, 2003, AM J HUM GENET, V73, P627, DOI 10.1086/37759",24,3,3,1,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1857.0,1862,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_287,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400038,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0024793388429752063,1.6327516048287155e-14,0.009681264456832931,0.08695417838182586,0.009681264456832931

Moreover, it is known that taekwondo shows high risk of injury. The aim of this case study is to evaluate the effects of a specific training protocol on posturographic parameters of a taekwondo elite athlete in order to prevent the risk of injury. Materials and methods: The specific training protocol provided 2 months of general strength conditioning, which included pre-conditioning in the first 2 weeks, physical training to improve explosive strength, balance and postural control and athletic training to improve the combat technique. The experimental design included three assessment times: the pre-test (T-0), the intermediate-test (T-1) and the post-test (T-2). Each test provided the same evaluations: anthropometric measurements, cervical ROM assessment and posturographic evaluation. Results: Stabilometric parameters showed a good balance and postural control both in T-0 and T-2. Baropodometric parameters showed a physiological load pressure distribution between the left and the right foot in T-0 (left foot 54% - right foot 46%) as well as in T-2 (left foot 45% - right foot 55%). The left forefoot-rearfoot ratio pressure showed no differences between T-0 and T-2 (p>0.05); we found an improvement on the right forefoot-rearfoot ratio (p<0.05). Cervical range of motion evaluation showed no significant variations from T-0 to T-2 (p>0.05) on rotation and lateral bending movements; we found an improvement on the extension movement from T-0 to T-2 (p<0.05), while the flexion movement decreased (p>0.05). Conclusion: The presented case study showed that the experimental protocol improved the postural parameters of this taekwondo elite athlete. We believe that other athletes may adopt this protocol in order to improve own sports performance and to prevent injuries.","[Barcellona, Matteo; Battaglia, Giuseppe; Palma, Antonio] Univ Palermo, Sport & Exercise Sci Res Unit, Palermo, Italy; [Giustino, Valerio; Messina, Giuseppe; Iovane, Angelo] Univ Palermo, Posturol & Biomech Lab Res Unit, Palermo, Italy; [Giustino, Valerio; Messina, Giuseppe] Posturalab Italia Res Inst, Palermo, Italy; [Messina, Giuseppe; Battaglia, Giuseppe; Palma, Antonio; Iovane, Angelo] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy; [Battaglia, Giuseppe; Palma, Antonio] CONI Sicilia, Reg Sports Sch, Sicily, Italy; [Fischetti, Francesco] Univ Bari, Dept Basic Med Sci Neurosci & Sense Organs, Bari, Italy","Messina, G (corresponding author), Via Giovanni Pascoli 6, Palermo, Italy.",giuseppe.messina17@unipa.it,"Giustino, Valerio/AAR-6788-2021; Messina, Giuseppe/N-7298-2019; Battaglia, Giuseppe/AAV-3916-2020","Giustino, Valerio/0000-0002-4575-8021; Messina, Giuseppe/0000-0003-2774-4950; Battaglia, Giuseppe/0000-0002-7758-7175; Francesco, Fischetti/0000-0001-8616-5372",,,"Alexandrov AV, 2001, BIOL CYBERN, V84, P435, DOI 10.1007/PL0000798; Baldini A, 2013, AVIAT SPACE ENVIR MD, V84, P823, DOI 10.3357/ASEM.3541.201; Battaglia G, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P1589, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_13; Battaglia G, 2010, AGING CLIN EXP RES, V22, P406, DOI [10.3275/6713, 10.1007/BF03337736; Bellafiore M, 2011, AGING CLIN EXP RES, V23, P378, DOI [10.3275/7354, 10.1007/BF03337762; Bianco A, 2016, J SPORTS MED, V; Bianco A, 2014, J INT SOC SPORT NUTR, V11, DOI 10.1186/1550-2783-11-3; Cho Kang Ok, 2013, J Lifestyle Med, V3, P5; Creath R, 2005, NEUROSCI LETT, V377, P75, DOI 10.1016/j.neulet.2004.11.07; Gorgy O, 2008, J SPORT SCI, V26, P629, DOI 10.1080/0264041070167040; GURFINKEL VS, 1995, NEUROSCIENCE, V68, P229, DOI 10.1016/0306-4522(95)00136-; Hamaoui A, 2014, GAIT POSTURE, V39, P333, DOI 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2013.07.13; Hrysomallis C, 2007, SPORTS MED, V37, P547, DOI 10.2165/00007256-200737060-0000; Ji M, 2016, J PHYS THER SCI, V28, P231, DOI 10.1589/jpts.28.154; Kazemi Mohsen, 2009, J Can Chiropr Assoc, V53, P14; Lystad RP, 2015, BIOL SPORT, V32, P213, DOI 10.5604/20831862.115030; Lystad RP, 2009, J SCI MED SPORT, V12, P614, DOI 10.1016/j.jsams.2008.09.01; McLeod TCV, 2009, J SPORT REHABIL, V18, P465, DOI 10.1123/jsr.18.4.46; Neto HP, 2015, J BODYW MOV THER, V19, P429, DOI 10.1016/j.jbmt.2014.09.00; Runge CF, 1999, GAIT POSTURE, V10, P161, DOI 10.1016/S0966-6362(99)00032-; Thomas E, 2018, MEDICINE, V97, DOI 10.1097/MD.000000000001024; van Dijk GP, 2013, FRONT AGING NEUROSCI, V5, DOI 10.3389/fnagi.2013.0001; Verhagen E, 2004, AM J SPORT MED, V32, P1385, DOI 10.1177/036354650326217; Winter DA, 1998, J NEUROPHYSIOL, V80, P1211, DOI 10.1152/jn.1998.80.3.121; Yoon SD, 2015, J PHYS THER SCI, V27, P509, DOI 10.1589/jpts.27.50",25,4,4,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,3.0,,1533.0,1538,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3s_236,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GP7NG,WOS:000441088400013,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0025826446280991736,3.165353961966743e-14,0.004570701845166564,0.08693543606922503,0.004560001746762869

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of FMS in the patients with CKD. Material and methods: A total of 289 (119 predialysis (PD), 85 hemodialysis (HD), 85 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)) patients were included. Diagnosis of FMS was based on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 FMS criteria. Results: Mean age was 52 +/- 16 years (range 18-89 years). One-hundred-sixty-four (56.7%) of them were male. A total of 46 patients (10 male/36 female) (15.9%) were diagnosed FMS. The prevalence of FMS was 28.8% in females and 6.1% in males. Compared to males, females had a significantly higher rate of FMS (p<0.001). The prevalence of FMS was 19.3% in PD group, 17.6% in the CAPD group, and 9.4% in the HD group. Although the frequency of FMS was lower in HD group compared to both the PD and the CAPD groups, the differences were not statistically significant (for HD vs PD, p=0.052; for HD vs CAPD, p=0.113). In PD group, hemoglobin (Hb) levels were significantly higher in patients with FMS than without FMS. Parathormone (PTH) levels were significantly lower in CAPD patients with FMS than without FMS. Although the prevalence of FMS was increased in PD and CAPD patients, this increase did not reach statistical significance. FMS was markedly more prevalent in female patients. While the Hb level was lower in the PD patients with FMS, PTH level was lower in the CAPD patients diagnosed with FMS. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that the rate of FMS was higher in PD and CAPD patients compared to HD patients, although our results did not reach statistical significance. Among the entire demographic and laboratory parameters, female gender was found to be significant risk factor for development of FMS. Future multicenter studies which have large sample size are clearly needed to determine other factors related to development of FMS in patients with CKD.","[Berber, Ilhami] Malatya Educ Res Hosp, Dept Hematol, Malatya, Turkey; [Sahin, Idris] Inonu Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Nephrol Div, Malatya, Turkey; [Gorgel, Ahmet] Gozde Acad Hosp, Dept Endocrinol, Malatya, Turkey; [Cagin, Yasir Furkan] Malatya Educ Res Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Malatya, Turkey; [Bag, Harika Gozukara] Inonu Univ, Fac Med, Dept Biostat, Malatya, Turkey; [Berber, Nurcan Kirici] Malatya Educ Res Hosp, Dept Chest Med, Malatya, Turkey","Berber, I (corresponding author), Malatya Educ Res Hosp, TR-44280 Malatya, Turkey.",drilhamiberber@hotmail.com,"Sahin, Idris/AAS-4390-2020; Bag, Harika Gozde Gozukara/ABG-7588-2020; BERBER, Ilhami/ABI-6231-2020; görgel, ahmet/Q-3139-2019; Cagin, Yasir Furkan/ABI-2709-2020","Sahin, Idris/0000-0002-8683-3737; Bag, Harika Gozde Gozukara/0000-0003-1208-4072; BERBER, Ilhami/0000-0003-3312-8476; Cagin, Yasir Furkan/0000-0002-2538-857X",,,"Avila-Diaz M, 2006, PERITON DIALYSIS INT, V26, P7; Bagis S, 2013, RHEUMATOL INT, V33, P167, DOI 10.1007/s00296-011-2334-; Bardin T, 2003, CURR OPIN RHEUMATOL, V15, P48, DOI 10.1097/00002281-200301000-0000; Couto CI, 2008, HEMODIAL INT, V12, P66, DOI 10.1111/j.1542-4758.2008.00243.; Eckardt KU, 2012, KIDNEY INT SUPPL, V2, P7, DOI 10.1038/kisup.2012.; Ferrari R, 1996, Curr Opin Rheumatol, V8, P7; Kart-Koseoglu H, 2005, RHEUMATOL INT, V25, P270, DOI 10.1007/s00296-003-0431-; McCarberg BH, 2012, AM J THER, V19, P357, DOI 10.1097/MJT.0b013e3181ff7be; Sahin I, 2009, RENAL FAILURE, V31, P920, DOI 10.3109/0886022090321926; Sakarya ST, 2011, CLIN RHEUMATOL, V30, P1039, DOI 10.1007/s10067-011-1697-; Suk JH, 2012, EXP CLIN ENDOCR DIAB, V120, P401, DOI 10.1055/s-0032-130900; Suleymanlar G, 2011, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V26, P1862, DOI 10.1093/ndt/gfq65; Topbas M, 2005, SCAND J RHEUMATOL, V34, P140, DOI 10.1080/0300974051002633; WOLFE F, 1995, J RHEUMATOL, V22, P15; WOLFE F, 1995, ARTHRITIS RHEUM-US, V38, P19, DOI 10.1002/art.178038010; WOLFE F, 1990, ARTHRITIS RHEUM-US, V33, P160, DOI 10.1002/art.178033020; Yanova D, 2007, HIPPOKRATIA, V11, P19; Yuceturk TE, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V2205, P248",18,2,2,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,337.0,343,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_53,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400007,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001859504132231405,7.086043585901157e-24,0.006187118913828097,0.06309271631090109,0.006187118913828097

New ,generation high sensitivity troponin assays (hs-cTn) still present some limitations, thus, novel biomarkers to early rule-in and rule- out myocardial infarction in chest pain patients presenting to the EA are sought after. Among all, heart- type fatty acid binding protein (h-FABP) has been largely investigated. Studies performed on HFABP in these patients present marked heterogeneity. However, it can be stated that HFABP is clearly not a reliable marker for AMI diagnosis, neither as a stand-alone test nor in combination with hs-cTn. More interventional trials are needed and more homogeneous studies are required to understand whether HFABP can add incremental value in rule- out AMI and risk stratify chest pain patients, however, available data may not encourage going on investigating.","[Bivona, Giulia; Agnello, Luisa; Butera, Daniela; Ciaccio, Marcello] Univ Palermo, Dept Biopathol & Med Biotechnol, Sect Clin Biochem & Clin Mol Med, Palermo, Italy; [Ciaccio, Marcello] Univ Hosp Paolo Giaccone Palermo, Dept & UOC Lab Med, Palermo, Italy","Ciaccio, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Med Biotechnol & Biopathol, Via Vespro,129, I-90127 Palermo, Italy.",marcello.ciaccio@unipa.it,,,,,"Abbasi Walid Ahmad, 2017, J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad, V29, P10; Agnelli G, 2001, AM HEART J, V141, P190, DOI 10.1067/mhj.2001.11240; Agnello L, 2017, SCAND J CLIN LAB INV, V77, P428, DOI 10.1080/00365513.2017.133588; Agnello L, 2017, CLIN BIOCHEM, V50, P797, DOI 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2017.04.01; Alhadi HA, 2004, QJM-INT J MED, V97, P187, DOI 10.1093/qjmed/hch03; Bivona G, 2018, CLIN BIOCHEM, V58, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2018.04.02; Bivona G, 2016, ARCH MED RES, V47, P521, DOI 10.1016/j.arcmed.2016.12.00; Body R, 2017, EMERG MED J, V34, P349, DOI 10.1136/emermed-2016-20598; Body R, 2014, HEART, V100, P1462, DOI 10.1136/heartjnl-2014-30556; Body R, 2011, RESUSCITATION, V82, P1041, DOI 10.1016/j.resuscitation.2011.03.01; Cappellini Fabrizio, 2013, Acute Card Care, V15, P83, DOI 10.3109/17482941.2013.84194; Collinson PO, 2013, HEALTH TECHNOL ASSES, V17, P1, DOI 10.3310/hta1715; Collinson P, 2014, HEART, V100, P140, DOI 10.1136/heartjnl-2013-30471; Cubranic Z, 2012, BIOCHEM MEDICA, V22, P22; Cullen LA, 2017, CLIN CHEM, V63, P129, DOI 10.1373/clinchem.2016.25473; Daly MJ, 2011, J ELECTROCARDIOL, V44, P432, DOI 10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2011.03.00; Dupuy AM, 2015, AM J EMERG MED, V33, P326, DOI 10.1016/j.ajem.2014.11.01; Freund Y, 2012, AM J EMERG MED, V30, P1378, DOI 10.1016/j.ajem.2011.10.00; Gami Bhakti N, 2015, J Clin Diagn Res, V9, pBC22, DOI 10.7860/JCDR/2015/11006.545; Garcia-Valdecasas S, 2011, ACTA CARDIOL, V66, P315, DOI 10.1080/AC.66.3.211413; Gerede DM, 2015, CARDIOVASC J AFR, V26, P204, DOI 10.5830/CVJA-2015-02; Haltern G, 2010, AM J CARDIOL, V105, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2009.08.64; Ishii J, 1997, CLIN CHEM, V43, P137; Jones JD, 2017, CURR CARDIOL REV, V13, P189, DOI 10.2174/1573403X1366617011612145; Kilcullen N, 2007, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V50, P2061, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2007.08.02; Kitamura M, 2013, J CARDIOL, V62, P336, DOI 10.1016/j.jjcc.2013.06.00; Laugaudin G, 2016, EUR HEART J-ACUTE CA, V5, P354, DOI 10.1177/204887261558551; Leung YK, 2017, J EMERG MED, V53, P287, DOI 10.1016/j.jemermed.2017.05.00; Li CJ, 2010, ACTA PHARMACOL SIN, V31, P307, DOI 10.1038/aps.2010.; Liou K, 2015, ANN CLIN BIOCHEM, V52, P370, DOI 10.1177/000456321455327; Martin-Reyes R, 2016, PLOS ONE, V11, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.015281; McCann CJ, 2009, AM J CARDIOL, V103, P22, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.08.02; McMahon CG, 2012, AM J EMERG MED, V30, P267, DOI 10.1016/j.ajem.2010.11.02; Nichols M, 2014, EUR HEART J, V35, P2950, DOI 10.1093/eurheartj/ehu29; Niizeki T, 2007, CIRC J, V71, P1452, DOI 10.1253/circj.71.145; Pope JH, 2000, NEW ENGL J MED, V342, P1163, DOI 10.1056/NEJM20000420342160; Reichlin T, 2009, NEW ENGL J MED, V361, P858, DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa090042; Reiter M, 2013, HEART, V99, P708, DOI 10.1136/heartjnl-2012-30332; Reiter M, 2011, EUR HEART J, V32, P1379, DOI 10.1093/eurheartj/ehr03; Richards AM, 2015, AM J CARDIOL, V115, p48B, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2015.01.04; Roffi M, 2016, EUR HEART J, V37, P267, DOI 10.1093/eurheartj/ehv32; Schernthaner C, 2017, MEDICINE, V96, DOI 10.1097/MD.000000000000839; Schoenenberger AW, 2016, EUR HEART J-ACUTE CA, V5, P185, DOI 10.1177/204887261557125; Thygesen K, 2012, CIRCULATION, V126, P2020, DOI 10.1161/CIR.0b013e31826e105; Viswanathan K, 2010, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V55, P2590, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2009.12.06; Vupputuri Anjith, 2015, Indian Heart J, V67, P538, DOI 10.1016/j.ihj.2015.06.03; Wang HL, 2018, JCPSP-J COLL PHYSICI, V28, P56, DOI 10.29271/jcpsp.2018.01.5; Wang J, 2017, J GERIATR CARDIOL, V14, P135, DOI 10.11909/j.issn.1671-5411.2017.02.00; Willemsen RTA, 2015, EUR J GEN PRACT, V21, P156, DOI 10.3109/13814788.2015.101393; Xu LQ, 2018, HEART LUNG CIRC, V27, P503, DOI 10.1016/j.hlc.2017.03.16; Young JM, 2016, BMC EMERG MED, V16, DOI 10.1186/s12873-016-0089-; Zinellu A, 2011, CLIN CHEM LAB MED, V49, P897, DOI 10.1515/CCLM.2011.12",52,0,0,1,8,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1621.0,1625,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_250,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400001,,,,,2022-07-14,0.005371900826446281,8.565134302445812e-20,0.010509973453647199,0.07328059351224497,0.010509973453647199

Material and methods: The data of this cross-sectional study were collected through face-to face interviews held with 140 patients who were diagrtosed with stroke at least six months ago, hospitalized in Balikesir Atatiirk State Hospital Neurology Department between October 2015 and October-2016 and then discharged from the hospital. Results. In the study, the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale (SSQOL) was used, and the participants were asked whether they complied with the treatment regularly. The participants' mean scores were 2.29 +/- 0.83 for the SSQOL scale. The mean scores for the SSQOL scale were higher in the married participants in those krtowledgeable of stroke, in those who received rehabilitation, in non-smokers, in those who had hemiplegia and in those who were able to carry out physical activities independently(p<0.05). Of the participants, 67.1% stated that they complied with their treatment. According to the logistic regression model, compliance with the treatment was 2.03 times higher in the participants with secondary and higher education (95.0% CI: 1.10-5.34), 5.27 times higher in the participants residing in a city (95.0% Cl: 1.25-12.22), 7.30 times higher in the participants having stroke diagnosis for 6-11 months (95.0% Cl 5.38-10.43). Conclusion: It was concluded that two-thirds of the participants complied with their daily treatments regularly and the mean scores they obtained from the SSQOL were lower than the average score to be 'obtained from the scale.","[Cevik, Celalettin; Tekir, Ozlem; Kaya, Aysenur] Balikesir Univ, Sch Hlth, Dept Nursing, Publ Hlth, Balikesir, Turkey","Cevik, C (corresponding author), Balikesir Univ, Sch Hlth, Dept Nursing, Balikesir, Turkey.",celalettincevik@balikesir.edu.tr,", celalettin/J-3513-2019",", celalettin/0000-0002-1123-6196",,,"Arif H, 2007, NEUROL INDIA, V55, P13; Barak S, 2014, PHYS THER, V94, P101, DOI 10.2522/ptj.2012047; Barker-Collo S, 2015, NEUROEPIDEMIOLOGY, V45, P203, DOI 10.1159/00044110; Bashir S., 2017, PAKISTAN J NEUROLOGI, V12, P3; Bushnell CD, 2011, NEUROLOGY, V77, P1182, DOI 10.1212/WNL.0b013e31822f042; Chen CM, 2015, HEALTH QUAL LIFE OUT, V13, DOI 10.1186/s12955-015-0314-; Durmaz B., 2006, TURKISH J PHYS MED R, V52, P4; Feigin VL, 2014, LANCET, V383, P245, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61953-; Feigin VL, 2009, LANCET NEUROL, V8, P355, DOI 10.1016/S1474-4422(09)70025-; Hacihasanoglu R, 2011, J CLIN NURS, V20, P692, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2010.03534.; Hankey GJ, 2013, LANCET GLOB HEALTH, V1, pE239, DOI 10.1016/S2214-109X(13)70095-; Hashim S, 2014, P INT C SCI TECHN S; Heikinheimo T, 2015, MALAWI MED J, V27, P50, DOI 10.4314/mmj.v27i2.; Huang YH, 2013, AM J OCCUP THER, V67, P54, DOI 10.5014/ajot.2013.00482; Jaracz K, 2003, ACTA NEUROL SCAND, V107, P324, DOI 10.1034/j.1600-0404.2003.02078.; Kamal AK, 2015, BMC NEUROL, V15, DOI 10.1186/s12883-015-0471-; Khan SH, 2011, STROKE, V42, pE404, DOI 10.1161/STROKEAHA.111.61335; Lin EHB, 2012, ANN FAM MED, V10, P6, DOI 10.1370/afm.134; Marini S, 2017, NEUROCRIT CARE, P; Mathers CD, 2006, PLOS MED, V3, DOI 10.1371/journal.pmed.003044; Michaelsen SM, 2013, MOTRIZ, V19, P746, DOI 10.1590/S1980-6574201300040001; Muus I, 2010, SCAND J CARING SCI, V24, P211, DOI 10.1111/j.1471-6712.2009.00705.; Naghavi M, 2015, LANCET, V385, P117, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-; Noto T, 2002, JAIDS-J ACQ IMM DEF, V51, P812; O'Carroll RE, 2013, ANN BEHAV MED, V46, P358, DOI 10.1007/s12160-013-9515-; Owolabi MO, 2013, ACTA NEUROL SCAND, V128, P311, DOI 10.1111/ane.1212; Robinson RG, 2016, AM J PSYCHIAT, V173, P221, DOI 10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.1503036; Senocak O, 2008, J NEUROL SCI-TURK, V25, P16; Sprigg N, 2012, J STROKE CEREBROVASC, V21, P587, DOI 10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2011.01.00; Thrift AG, 2014, INT J STROKE, V9, P6, DOI 10.1111/ijs.1224; van Mierlo ML, 2014, INT J STROKE, V9, P341, DOI 10.1111/ijs.1214; Visser MM, 2015, ARCH PHYS MED REHAB, V96, P1492, DOI 10.1016/j.apmr.2015.04.00; Viswanathan M, 2012, ANN INTERN MED, V157, P785, DOI 10.7326/0003-4819-157-11-201212040-0053; Vos T, 2015, LANCET, V386, P743, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60692-; Yont GH, 2012, INT NURS REV, V59, P274, DOI 10.1111/j.1466-7657.2011.00962.",35,0,0,1,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,839.0,846,,10.1919/0393-6384_2018_3_127,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000032,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003615702479338843,2.9643752693111455e-14,0.01562817260508607,0.08211949744224913,0.01562817260508607

In order to further study the characteristics of morphology, 1,100 patients with isthmic lumbar spondylolisthesis and degenerative spondylolisthesis, receiving clinic treatment by a hospital from January 2009 to February 2016, were randomly selected as the research object and all of them have complete image data. Patients were divided into spondylolysis group (550) and degeneration group (550). The relative spine and pelvic sagittal index of two groups of patients were collected, mainly covering the following aspects: inclination of pelvis, pelvic incidence angle and lumbar lordosis angle and so on. At the same time, the following parts of two groups were measured: angle of lumbar spondylolisthesis, spondylolisthesis rate, spondylolisthesis distance to analyze comparatively the above patients with these indicators. The results show that the angle of lumbar lordosis, thoracic posterior lobe and spondylolysis angle of the group of patients was significantly higher than that of degeneration group, meeting P < 0.05, which has statistical significance. The patients in the degeneration group were superior to spondylolysis group in vertical distance of sagittal axial. The comparison between two groups of patients does not exist statistical significance in following aspects: namely morphological parameters of the pelvis, pelvic tilt angle, sacral inclination angle and lumbar spondylolisthesis rate and so forth. Therefore, we can draw the conclusion that the isthmic lumbar spondylolisthesis of badminton players is similar to degenerative spondylolisthesis in pelvic morphology, but the former has larger thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis and spondylolisthesis angle than the latter.","[Chen, Sheng] Chengdu Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Chengdu 610106, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Rui] Sichuan Univ, Coll Literature & Journalism, Chengdu 610064, Peoples R China","Chen, S (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ, Phys Educ 1Sch, Chengdu 610106, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",787345913@qq.com,,,,,"Aldahmash BA, 2016, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V23, P311, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2015.09.02; Ali MA, 2016, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V23, P229, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2015.02.01; Bich GA, 2017, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V24, P851, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2016.05.01; Gao W, 2017, SAUDI PHARM J, V25, P580, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2017.04.02; Ge SB, 2017, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V24, P127, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2016.09.00; [何守玉 He Shouyu], 2015, [中国矫形外科杂志, Orthopedic Journal of China], V23, P7; [何守玉 He Shouyu], 2014, [中国脊柱脊髓杂志, Chinese Journal of Spine and Spinal Cord], V24, P10; Jin Wang, 2016, CHINESE J TISSUE ENG, V22, P332; Kos M, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P21; Liang LI, 2013, CHINESE J REPARATIVE, V11, P133; Song HM, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P30; Taheri M, 2017, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V33, P597, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_08; Turhan Iyidir O, 2017, TURK J MED SCI, V47, P1751, DOI 10.3906/sag-1610-13; Uluocak N, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P1029, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_12; Wang Y, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P98; Yang AM, 2017, J ALLOY COMPD, V695, P915, DOI 10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.10.18; Yang YS, 2018, IEEE INSTRU MEAS MAG, V21, P34, DOI 10.1109/MIM.2018.827880; Yong Liu, 2013, CHINESE J SPINE SPIN, V23, P30",18,0,0,0,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,3.0,,1583.0,1587,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3s_246,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GP7NG,WOS:000441088400022,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001859504132231405,1.9009854663879362e-05,0.06142496633040807,0.09603460420449021,0.05538411281460909

Fascioliasis is a parasite disease that might have changes in liver parenchyma and in bile ducts. Many inflammatory reactions occur during the settlement of larvae and mature parasites into the liver. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has become a prominent marker of underlying inflammation. The objective of the present study is to investigate the relationship between the hematological parameters in patients with fascioliasis. Materials and methods: The diagnosis of fascioliasis was based on patient history, clinical and laboratory findings, radiological imaging (ultrasound), stool examination and IgG antibody titer determination by ELISA. Clinical and laboratory data were collected for 56 patients with fascioliasis, and diagnosed with serological and radiological imaging. 56 healthy volunteers were selected for the control group. Stool and blood samples were collected from patients with fascioliasis for serologic, biochemical, hematologic tests and ova examination. Total leukocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil and lymphocyte counts were recorded and NLR was calculated. ELISA antibody cut off titer value of patients with fascioliasis was 10> positive. Results: We compared neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, eosinophil/lymphocyte ratio, the relation of eosinophilia and IgG antibody titers between two groups (patient and control groups). There was no statistically significant difference between patients and healthy controls neither based on age and gender nor NLR. According to these findings, NLR can not be considered as a diagnostic marker in fascioliasis. Conclusion: As a result, it was determined that NLR is not a crucial indicator of inflammation in parasitic fascioliasis. Extensive studies are need to be done to clarify the correlation between NLR and progression of other parasitic diseases.","[Cicek, Mutalip] Ahi Evran Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Kirsehir, Turkey; [Deveci, Ozcan] Elazig Med Pk Hosp, Dept Clin Microbiol & Infect Dis, Elazig, Turkey; [Cengiz, ZeynepTas] Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Parasitol, Van, Turkey; [Bilden, Alican; Bilik, Ozge Alkan] Dicle Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Diyarbakir, Turkey","Deveci, O (corresponding author), Elazig Med Pk Hosp, Dept Clin Microbiol & Infect Dis, Elazig, Turkey.",,,,,,"Abakay O, 2015, INFLAMMATION, V38, P691, DOI 10.1007/s10753-014-9978-; Abdel-Razik A, 2015, ACTA GASTRO-ENT BELG, V78, P38; Ahsen A, 2013, INFLAMMATION, V36, P1357, DOI 10.1007/s10753-013-9675-; Berasain P, 2000, EXP PARASITOL, V94, P99, DOI 10.1006/expr.1999.447; Duffy BK, 2006, AM J CARDIOL, V97, P993, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2005.10.03; Dusak A, 2012, J CLIN IMAG SCI, V2, DOI 10.4103/2156-7514.9237; Garcia LS, 2007, DIAGNOSTIC MED PARAS, P43; Graziosi L, 2015, AM J SURG, V209, P333, DOI 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2014.06.01; Karahocagil MK, 2011, ACTA TROP, V118, P177, DOI 10.1016/j.actatropica.2008.08.01; Maguire JH, 2005, PRINCIPLES PRACTICE, P327; Marcos L, 2006, T ROY SOC TROP MED H, V100, P158, DOI 10.1016/j.trstmh.2005.05.01; Markell EK, 1986, MED PARASITOLOGY, V6th, P16; Mas-Coma S, 2005, INT J PARASITOL, V35, P1255, DOI 10.1016/j.ijpara.2005.07.01; Nakano K, 2014, ANTICANCER RES, V34, P381; Olt S, 2015, BIOMED RES INT, V2015, DOI 10.1155/2015/21050; Sarraf KM, 2009, J THORAC CARDIOV SUR, V137, P425, DOI 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2008.05.04; Templeton AJ, 2014, JNCI-J NATL CANCER I, V106, DOI 10.1093/jnci/dju12; Turkmen K, 2013, HEMODIAL INT, V17, P391, DOI 10.1111/hdi.1204; van Wolfswinkel ME, 2013, MALARIA J, V12, DOI 10.1186/1475-2875-12-10; Yang Meng, 2015, Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue, V27, P471, DOI 10.3760/cma.j.issn.2095-4352.2015.06.01",20,0,0,1,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,4.0,,,,,955.0,958,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4_145,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ1AT,WOS:000434986500008,,,,,2022-07-14,0.002066115702479339,1.466604446747771e-14,0.003720740249312414,0.09288490140574773,0.0037254102345461166

In the football field, we proposed a correlation of gender differences in strength abilities of both female and male athletes. Materials and methods: The experimentation was carried out on two groups of, footballer athletes of the same age and of different genders. The Bosco's Test, more specifically the Counter Movement Jump, was employed as a reference model, through a recently introduced tool called Chronojump, and a new test model, called Powersprint, considering both them as performance indexes for two groups of athletes, in order to study the athlete's explosive-elastic muscle strength. Results: The male gender registered a higher muscle strength expression in both tests. Discussion: The assessment of the lower limbs strength is closely linked to the sports practice of football. The Powersprint tool can be employed for analyzing athletes' motor abilities.","[Cusano, Pampilio; Iovino, Salvatore; Tafuri, Domenico] Parthenope Univ, Via Medina 40, Naples, Italy","Tafuri, D (corresponding author), Parthenope Univ, Via Medina 40, Naples, Italy.",domenicotafuri@inwind.it,,,,,"Akubat I, 2012, J SPORT SCI, V30, P1473, DOI 10.1080/02640414.2012.71271; Ascione A, 2018, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V34, P1261, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_19; Bangsbo J., 1993, ACTA PHYSL SCANDIN S, V619, P; Belfiore P, 2018, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V34, P1257, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_19; BOSCO C, 1983, EUR J APPL PHYSIOL O, V50, P273, DOI 10.1007/BF0042216; Castagna C, 2006, J STRENGTH COND RES, V20, P320, DOI 10.1519/00124278-200605000-0001; de Blas X, 2012, RICYDE-REV INT CIENC, V8, P334, DOI 10.5232/ricyde2012.0300; Di Palma D, 2018, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V34, P1253, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_19; Gabbett TJ, 2008, J STRENGTH COND RES, V22, P174, DOI 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31815ef70; Hopkins WG, 2001, SPORTS MED, V31, P211, DOI 10.2165/00007256-200131030-0000; Hopkins WG., 2004, SPORTSCIENCE, V8, P1, DOI DOI 10.1097/00005768-199804000-0002; Kawamori N, 2014, J STRENGTH COND RES, V28, P2738, DOI 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3182915ed; Lockie RG, 2013, J SPORT SCI MED, V12, P8; Palma D. di, 2018, Journal of Physical Education and Sport, V18, P47; Palma D. di, 2017, Sport Science, V10, P3; Palma D. di, 2017, Sport Science, V10, P1; Palma D. di, 2016, Journal of Physical Education and Sport, V16, P78; Palma D. di, 2016, Sport Science, V9, P2; Pasquarelli BN, 2010, REV ANDALUZA MED DEP, V; Raiola G, 2017, SPORT SCI, V10, P5; Raiola G., 2016, SPORT SCI, V9, P4; Sands WA, 2004, J STRENGTH COND RES, V18, P81; Sheppard JM, 2006, J SPORT SCI, V24, P919, DOI 10.1080/0264041050045710; Svensson M, 2005, J SPORT SCI, V23, P601, DOI 10.1080/0264041040002129; Tafuri D., 2017, SPORT SCI, V10, P7; TIROSH E, 1990, AM J DIS CHILD, V144, P1083, DOI 10.1001/archpedi.1990.0215034002701",26,0,0,0,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,3.0,,1525.0,1528,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3s_234,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GP7NG,WOS:000441088400011,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0025826446280991736,4.1196070136447346e-05,0.003167620033684758,0.08273574987820409,0.0031711696704590266

The diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis is difficult. We present a review of the literature and describe a case of 49-year old woman. Her symptoms began in June 2004 with sore throat, dysphonia, pain in the thoracic wall and some joints, a slightly raised temperature and cough. The objective picture was immediately apparent after carrying out a high definition neck-thorax computed tomography and a laryngoscopy with fiber optics, which showed considerable laryngo-tracheal damage. As can be seen the diagnosis of RP today remains very difficult. The delay in diagnosis of our patient was considerable as described in literature and now estimated to be about 2.9 years.

There are no studies investigating the factors affecting survival in patients treated with open abdominal technique alone. These factors should be investigated retrospectively in open abdomen patients. We aimed to investigate the factors of survival in patients with severe intraabdominal sepsis treated with vacuum-assisted closure systems for open abdomen. We hypothesized that use of open abdomen with vacuum-assisted closure systems was reduced mortality in patients with severe intraabdominal sepsis. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed 40 open abdomen patients performed vacuum-assisted closure for severe intraabdominal sepsis. Alive and mortal groups were evaluated in terms of age, gender, body mass index, etiology of surgical abdominal sepsis, Apache II score, Mannheim peritonitis index score, Bjorck classification, fascia score, abdominal defect size, stoma and fistula presence, and vacuum-assisted closure treatment duration. It was evaluated whether any of these parameters was effective on survival. Results: Mean age and body mass index were significantly elevated in the mortal group compared with the alive group. A significant difference with regard to Bjorck classification was detected between the alive and mortal groups. In Bjorck 1 and 2, mortality rates were 36.8% and 31.3%, respectively, while in Bjorck 4, mortality was 100%. The presence and ope of fistula were statistically significant for mortality. None of the other parameters were statistically significant for mortality. Discussion: The studies of the last twelve years showed that the open abdomen technique with the temporary abdominal wall closure using negative pressure dressing methods gave positive results. The 42.5% mortality rate in our study is much lower than the mortality rate for abdominal sepsis patients in the literature. Our study indicated that the management of open abdomen and negative pressure therapy was possible to increase the survival in patients with surgical abdominal sepsis.","[Egin, Seracettin; Gokcek, Berk; Yesiltas, Metin; Hot, Semih; Kamali, Sedat; Isil, Riza Gurhan; Tok, Hasan; Karahan, Servet Rustu] Saglik Bilimleri Univ, Okmeydani Educ & Res Hosp, Darulaceze Cad 25, TR-34384 Istanbul, Turkey","Egin, S (corresponding author), Saglik Bilimleri Univ, Okmeydani Educ & Res Hosp, Darulaceze Cad 25, TR-34384 Istanbul, Turkey.",seracettin_egin@hotmail.com,"Hot, Semih/ADG-3811-2022; Yeşiltaş, Metin/Q-8190-2019; Yeşiltaş, Metin/R-3639-2018; eğin, seracettin/AAR-8417-2020","Hot, Semih/0000-0001-9623-356X; Yeşiltaş, Metin/0000-0002-2080-1572; Yeşiltaş, Metin/0000-0002-2080-1572; eğin, seracettin/0000-0002-4090-5205",,,"Adkins AL, 2004, AM SURGEON, V70, P13; Angus D C, 2001, Crit Care Med, V29, P1303, DOI 10.1097/00003246-200107000-0000; Balogh Z, 2003, J TRAUMA, V54, P848, DOI 10.1097/01.TA.0000070166.29649.F; Bjorck M, 2009, WORLD J SURG, V33, P1154, DOI 10.1007/s00268-009-9996-; CHRISTOU NV, 1993, ARCH SURG-CHICAGO, V128, P19; Dellinger RP, 2013, INTENS CARE MED, V39, P165, DOI [10.1097/CCM.0b013e31827e83af, 10.1007/s00134-012-2769-8; Dellinger RP, 2008, INTENS CARE MED, V34, P783, DOI [10.1007/s00134-008-1040-9, 10.1007/s00134-007-0934-2; Demetriades D, 2012, INT WOUND J, V9, P17, DOI 10.1111/j.1742-481X.2012.01018.; Diaz JJ, 2010, J TRAUMA, V68, P1425, DOI 10.1097/TA.0b013e3181da0da; Hanisch Ernst, 2011, J Intensive Care Med, V26, P27, DOI 10.1177/088506661038405; Kaplan M, 2005, WOUNDS S1, V17, pS; Kirkpatrick AW, 2013, INTENS CARE MED, V39, P1190, DOI 10.1007/s00134-013-2906-; Kubiak BD, 2010, SHOCK, V34, P525, DOI 10.1097/SHK.0b013e3181e14cd; Moore LJ, 2011, J TRAUMA, V70, P672, DOI 10.1097/TA.0b013e31820e780; Plaudis Haralds, 2012, Ann Intensive Care, V2 Suppl 1, pS23, DOI 10.1186/2110-5820-2-S1-S2; Rausei Stefano, 2014, Surg Technol Int, V25, P6; Robledo Felipe A, 2007, Surg Infect (Larchmt), V8, P63, DOI 10.1089/sur.2006.8.01; Sartelli M, 2015, WORLD J EMERG SURG, V10, DOI 10.1186/s13017-015-0032-; Sartelli M, 2014, WORLD J EMERG SURG, V9, DOI 10.1186/1749-7922-9-2; Terzi C, 2014, INT WOUND J, V11, P17, DOI 10.1111/iwj.1228; van Hensbroek PB, 2009, WORLD J SURG, V33, P199, DOI 10.1007/s00268-008-9867-; Vargo D, 2009, AM SURGEON, V75, pS; Verdam FJ, 2011, WORLD J SURG, V35, P2348, DOI 10.1007/s00268-011-1210-",23,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,2031.0,2036,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400068,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0023760330578512395,1.4570141417182275e-14,0.02364722051534582,0.09396872239426092,0.025045717860933205

Material and methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out with 213 students at the Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Dentistry and Faculty of Health Sciences. The construct validity of the Turkish version of the scale was analyzed with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). To determine the reliability of the scale, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was calculated. In addition, for the assessment of the discrimination of each item on the scale, the top and bottom 27 % from the groups that received the lowest and highest scores from the scale were compared. Results: Standardized coefficients determined with the CFA in the Turkish version of the scale ranged between 0.34 and 0.85 in the students (Except for Item 18). The explained variance values for the items other than item 18 ranged from 0.11 to 0.72. t-values of all the factor loadings were significant. According to the reliability studies of the RIPLS, the internal consistency of Cronbach's Alpha was 0.85 for the overall scale. The t-test results showed that all the items significantly discriminated between students of high and low performance (t: 99.57; p=0.01). Conclusion: As a result, it can be said that the validity and reliability study of the RIPLS administered to Turkish healthcare students indicated that the scale was capable of measuring the Turkish-speaking students' readiness for interprofessional education.","[Ergonul, Esin] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Educ, Izmir, Turkey; [Ergonul, Esin] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Vocat Sch Hlth Serv, Izmir, Turkey; [Baskurt, Ferdi; Baskurt, Zeliha] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Phys Therapy & Rehabil, Isparta, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Nilufer Demiral] Ege Univ, Dept Med Educ, Fac Med, Izmir, Turkey; [Asci, Halil] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Fac Med, Isparta, Turkey; [Koc, Sukran] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Dept Midwifery, Fac Hlth Sci, Isparta, Turkey; [Temel, Ugur Burak] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Dent, Isparta, Turkey","Baskurt, F (corresponding author), Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Phys Therapy & Rehabil, Isparta, Turkey.",,"Ergonul, Esin/Q-2657-2019",,,,"Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, ACGME COMM PROGR RE; Artino AR, 2014, MED TEACH, V36, P463, DOI 10.3109/0142159X.2014.88981; Baumgartner H., 1996, INT J RES MARK, V13, P139, DOI [https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-8116(95)00038-0, DOI 10.1016/0167-8116(95)00038-0; Byrne BM, 1999, J CROSS CULT PSYCHOL, V30, P555, DOI 10.1177/002202219903000500; CHIC Working Group, 2012, INV QUANT TOOLS MEA; Frye AW, 2012, MED TEACH, V34, pE288, DOI 10.3109/0142159X.2012.66863; Gjersing L, 2010, BMC MED RES METHODOL, V10, DOI 10.1186/1471-2288-10-1; Guitard, 2010, JPHYSICAL THERAPY ED, V24, P19, DOI [10.1097/00001416-201010000-00005, DOI 10.1097/00001416-201010000-00005; Hall P, 2005, J INTERPROFESSION S1, V19, P188, DOI DOI 10.1080/1356182050008174; Hean S, 2012, MED TEACH, V34, pE78, DOI 10.3109/0142159X.2012.65074; Hooper D, 2008, STRUCTURAL EQUATIO; Hu LT, 1999, STRUCT EQU MODELING, V6, P1, DOI 10.1080/1070551990954011; Interprofessional Education Collaborative, 2016, COR COMP INT COLL P; Kenny Gerard, 2002, Nurs Stand, V17, P3; Kline R.B, 2011, PRINCIPLES PRACTIC; Lauffs M, 2008, MED EDUC, V42, P405, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2923.2008.03017.; MacCallum RC, 2000, ANNU REV PSYCHOL, V51, P201, DOI 10.1146/annurev.psych.51.1.20; Mahler C, 2014, BMC MED EDUC, V14, DOI 10.1186/1472-6920-14-14; McFadyen A K, 2005, J Interprof Care, V19, P59; National Medical Education Accreditation Board, 2018, UND MED ED STAN; National Nurse Education Accreditation Board, 2013, UND NURS ED STAN; Norgaard B, 2016, BMC MED EDUC, V16, DOI 10.1186/s12909-016-0591-; Parsell G, 1999, MED EDUC, V33, P95, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2923.1999.00298.; Reeves S, 2016, MED TEACH, V38, P656, DOI 10.3109/0142159X.2016.117366; Simin D, 2010, SRP ARK CELOK LEK, V138, P480, DOI 10.2298/SARH1008480; Tyastuti D, 2014, J INTERPROF CARE, V28, P426, DOI 10.3109/13561820.2014.90777; Walsh Claire L, 2005, Nurse Educ Pract, V5, P230, DOI 10.1016/j.nepr.2004.12.00; World Health Organization (WHO), 2010, FRAM ACT INT ED COL",28,3,3,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,797.0,803,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_122,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000042,,,,,2022-07-14,0.002892561983471074,2.502401221847604e-18,0.00557101981882904,0.06210901158127747,0.00557101981882904

For this purpose, 30 untrained males voluntarily participated in the research and were randomly assigned to one of two resistance exercise groups: a) a shorter inter-set rest interval of 90 second (RI-90; n=10); or b) a longer rest interval of 180 second (RI-180; n=10) and control group (10 people). Resistance exercise in both groups consisted of bench press; pull down curls with pulleys, biceps and triceps workout with a barbell, squat using (hack squat machine), lat pull down and sit-ups, which were performed with 50% of one repetition maximum in the first session and with 85% of one repetition maximum on the last session and in 8-12 repetitions in 3 sets. Before and after 8 weeks training period blood sampling were collected from the antecubital vein preexercise. Indndent and paired T Tests were used to analyze data in a meaningful level (p<0.05). Results showed thepeat there is statistically significant reduction in CRP, homocysteine levels after 8 weeks of resistance training with different rest intervals in the experimental group compared to the control group (p<0.05). In general, we can say that the difference between rest periods in resistance training can be an important factor in changes in serum levels of homocysteine and CRP are important. These exercises might probably decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease.","[Etemad, Zaher; Nikbakht, Hojatollah] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Exercise Physiol, Tehran, Iran; [Azarbayjani, Mohammad Ali] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Exercise Physiol, Tehran Cent Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Gholami, Mandana] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Exercise Physiol, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran","Nikbakht, H (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Exercise Physiol, Tehran, Iran.",hojnik1937@yahoo.com,"etemad, zaher/ABB-1926-2021","Azarbayjani, Mohammad Ali/0000-0002-3502-7487",,,"Abramson JL, 2002, ARCH INTERN MED, V162, P1286, DOI 10.1001/archinte.162.11.128; Bruun JM, 2006, AM J PHYSIOL-ENDOC M, V290, pE961, DOI 10.1152/ajpendo.00506.200; Brzycki M., 1993, J PHYS EDUC RECREAT, V64, P88, DOI [DOI 10.1080/07303084.1993.10606684, 10.1080/07303084.1993.10606684; de Salles BF, 2009, SPORTS MED, V39, P765, DOI 10.2165/11315230-000000000-0000; Fantuzzi G, 2005, J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUN, V115, P911, DOI 10.1016/j.jaci.2005.02.02; Fleck S.

Endocrine systems are a physiological interface with the environment and genetic-environmental interactions are disrupted by EDCs. Today, there are almost 1000 chemicals reported to have endocrine effects: the prevalence of EDC in our environment and in our bodies represents a major global health challenge. This review gathers the studies that have investigated the correlations between exposure to EDC and pathologies of the female reproductive system and fetal development. Methods: A PubMed research was conducted using the keywords, their variants, and their combinations (BPA, DES, MXC, pesticides, phthalates, plasticizers, PCBs, dioxins, ovaries, oocytes, ovaries, fallopian tubes, follicles, vagina, uterus, fibroids, fertility, infertility, puberty, polycystic ovary syndrome, premature ovarian failure, birth, preterm birth, birth outcome, steroid, hormone, female, girl and menopause). Results: The endocrine system plays a central role in all vertebrates and regulates critical biological functions such as metabolism, development, reproduction, and behavior. Epidemiological studies link EDCs with reproductive effects, neuro-behavioral and neurodevelopment alterations, metabolic syndrome, bone disorders, immune disorders, and cancers in humans. Human investigations confirm the results of the studies carried out on animal showing associations with many additional effects on health, including asthma, learning and behavior problems, premature puberty, infertility, breast and prostate cancer, Parkinson's disease, obesity and other diseases. Conclusions: It is important to undertake research with follow-up methodologies and/or longitudinal studies to detect the extent of exposure of pregnant women to EDCs and halogenated substances and the effects of such exposure on brain development. A future research hypothesis may consider the effect that these substances have on neuro-development and, more specifically, how EDCs are involved in pathogenic disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In addition, a scientific study could be performed on the correlations between this type of substance and the inconveniences found in the field of executive frontal functions.","[Gigante, Elena; Moretto, Enrico;

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of diabetic neuropathic pain on depression and quality of life. Material and methods: The study was designed as cross-sectional and descriptive study and was conducted between February and April of 2016 with 40 diabetic individuals diagnosed with diabetic neuropathy. Data were collected using the Diabetes Individual Identification Form, Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptom and Signs Scale, Beck's Depression Inventory and the EORTC QLQ-C30 Quality of Life Questionnaire. Verbal and written consent was obtained and the data were analyzed with the SPSS program. Results: 25 women and 15 men participated in this study. It was determined that 50% of the individuals participating in the study had had diabetes for 6-10 years, 55% had received insulin treatment and 25% had only received oral anti-diabetic (OAD) treatment. The mean score for the LANSS pain scale of diabetic subjects was 9.83, the mean score for the BECK's Depression Inventory was 18.03 and the mean score for the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire was 612. The correlation coefficient between the LANSS pain scale and the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire was significant for individuals with diabetic neuropathic pain. There was a positive correlation between the two scales (r=0.671, p=0.000 <alpha=0.05.). There was a positive but weak relationship between the LANSS Pain Scale and the BECK Depression Inventory, while no significant relationship was found between the BECK Depression Inventory and the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire for individuals with neuropathic pain (r=0.097, p=0.551>alpha=0.05.) rs=0.312, p=0.050 =alpha=0.05). Conclusion: Diabetic neuropathic pain seriously affects the quality of life and increases susceptibility to psychological problems such as depression. When using a patient-specific treatment approach for diabetes, taking into account the data on depression and quality of life will increase the patient's participation in the treatment process and the success of the treatment.","[Gokmen, Sibel] Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Ataturk Res Hosp, Izmir, Turkey; [Avdal, Elif Unsal; Uran, Berna Nilgun Ozgursoy] Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Izmir, Turkey","Avdal, EU (corresponding author), Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Izmir, Turkey.",,"AVDAL, ELİF UNSAL/ABE-9593-2021",,,,"AARONSON NK, 1993, J NATL CANCER I, V85, P365, DOI 10.1093/jnci/85.5.36; American Diabetes Association (ADA), 2015, DIABETES CARE, V38, P; Bahar A., 2006, ANADOLU PSIKIYATR DE, V7, P1; Bai JW, 2017, J DIABETES COMPLICAT, V31, P1318, DOI 10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2017.05.00; BECK AT, 1961, ARCH GEN PSYCHIAT, V4, P561, DOI 10.1001/archpsyc.1961.0171012003100; Bennett M, 2001, PAIN, V92, P147, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3959(00)00482-; Beser N, 2003, CU NURS SCH J, V7, P4; Blackburn-Munro G, 2001, J NEUROENDOCRINOL, V13, P1009, DOI 10.1046/j.0007-1331.2001.00727.; Cragg JJ, 2015, NEUROEPIDEMIOLOGY, V44, P130, DOI 10.1159/00037772; Dziemidok P, 2016, PSYCHIATR POL, V50, P407, DOI 10.12740/PP/OnlineFirst/4235; Fishbain DA, 1997, CLIN J PAIN, V13, P116, DOI 10.1097/00002508-199706000-0000; Grundy Scott M., 2002, Circulation, V105, P2231, DOI 10.1161/01.CIR.0000013952.86046.D; Gul HL, 2015, THESIS, P3; Gulseren L, 2001, TURKISH J PSYCHIAT, V12, P8; HAMILTON M, 1960, J NEUROL NEUROSUR PS, V23, P56, DOI 10.1136/jnnp.23.1.5; HIBBARD JH, 1983, SOC SCI MED, V17, P129, DOI 10.1016/0277-9536(83)90246-; Hisli N., 1989, GUVENIRLIGI, V7, P; International Diabetes Federation (IDF) , 2013, DIABETES ATLAS, V6t; Irem A., 2007, THESIS, P3; Kayahan M, 2007, DAHILI VE CERRAHI KL, P4; Marks JB, 2000, J DIABETES COMPLICAT, V14, P108, DOI 10.1016/S1056-8727(00)00065-; Noh JH, 2005, DIABETES RES CLIN PR, V69, P243, DOI 10.1016/j.diabres.2004.10.00; Satman I, 2002, DIABETES CARE, V25, P1551, DOI 10.2337/diacare.25.9.155; Satman I, 2013, EUR J EPIDEMIOL, V28, P169, DOI 10.1007/s10654-013-9771-; Sonmez B, 2013, TURK AILE HEK DERG, P11; T.

It manifests itself in different ways according to the level of development: in the smaller the child, the more anxiety is expressed with manifestations that involve the whole organism, becoming evident either with motor excitement or with physical discomfort. As the psychic apparatus is structured, anxiety is experienced as an inner phenomenon and is experienced as an unpleasant state. Fortunately, we are all a bit anxious, even if there are some people who are more, others less.","[Grieco, Maria] Presidio Riabilitaz Diocleziano, Naples, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, Palermo, Italy;

In this research, non-surgical rehabilitation treatment was applied for basketball player with PLC rupture, and followed investigations of therapeutic effects were performed. Method: In this work, 50 basketball players with simple PCL rupture, who had been treated in our hospital from Apr 2012 to Apr 2016, were selected as research objects, and all the selected basketball players were injured due to basketball reason. For all the selected players, a 5-stage non-surgical rehabilitation scheme with gradually increased load was applied. The ,first stage began from the 1st day to the 5th day since got injured; the second stage started from the 6th day to the 20th day since got injured; the third stage started from the 21st day to the 25th day since got injured; the fourth stage began from the 26th day to the 30th day since got injured; and the last stage started from one month later since gut injured, during which injured players were allowed to train with their team, in the hope of maintaing their physical strengths by gradually increasing exercise amount. From the 38th to the 78th day since ,got injured, KT2 test was performed to test the stress levels of quadriceps femoris of their both legs. Results: Through rehabilitation treatment, injured players can return to basketball training after averagely 38 days since get injured, morevoer the quadriceps,femoris strength of injured leg can recover to around 102% level of that of the non-injured leg. At the first test, the ratio between injured knee strength and non-injured knee strength was 0.52:1, can then increased to 0.96:1 at the 14th day since got injured. After returing to basketball training, knee joint injuries did not reappear, the therapeutic effect was ideal and the satisfaction degree on the treatment was high. Conclusion: Regarding simple PCL rupture of basketball player, non-surgical rehabilitation treatment can achieve ideal therapeutic effect, promote the function recovery of knee joint , significantly reduce and eliminate symptoms of knee joint, and accelerate the recovery as soon as possible.","[Hu, Jiang] Shihezi Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Shihezi 832000, Peoples R China","Hu, J (corresponding author), Shihezi Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Shihezi 832000, Peoples R China.",214099889@qq.com,,,,,"Ahmad Z, 2016, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V23, P741, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2016.07.00; Attari Z, 2016, SAUDI PHARM J, V24, P57, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2015.03.00; Duzer S, 2017, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V33, P637, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_09; Gao Shijun, 2011, CHINESE J ORTHOPAEDI, V3; Gao Shijun, 2010, J HEBEI MED ; Gao W, 2017, SAUDI PHARM J, V25, P548, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2017.04.02; Hazra M, 2015, SAUDI PHARM J, V23, P429, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2015.01.00; Ibrahim S, 2016, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V23, pS56, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2015.10.02; Jiang Bole, 2006, CHINESE J CLIN REHAB, V10, P1; Maltese A, 2017, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V33, P667, DOI 10.19193/03936384_2017_4_10; Moty SGA, 2016, SAUDI PHARM J, V24, P119, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2013.12.01; Ofori-Kwakye K, 2016, SAUDI PHARM J, V24, P82, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2015.03.00; Peng WX, 2017, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V24, P103, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2016.08.01; Teixeira MC, 2017, SAUDI PHARM J, V25, P231, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2016.06.00; Turhan Iyidir O, 2017, TURK J MED SCI, V47, P1751, DOI 10.3906/sag-1610-13; Wroblewska K, 2015, SAUDI PHARM J, V23, P407, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2014.11.00; Yang AM, 2017, J ALLOY COMPD, V695, P915, DOI 10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.10.18; 王晓琨, 2012, [中国老年学杂志, Chinese Journal of Gerontology], V32, P43",18,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,3.0,,1561.0,1564,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GP7NG,WOS:000441088400017,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001859504132231405,0.0009455466432205191,0.03144312571631762,0.10036600412661877,0.04003788161080833

As well, patient group with thalassemia trait (minor) is considered as iron deficiency anemia erroneously in daily practice and this group is subjected to excess iron treatment unnecessarily. In this study, if unnecessary iron load in the patients with thalassemia minor had any effect on insulin resistance was assessed. Materials and methods: A two-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in 30 thalassemia carrier patients and 30 gender-age-history matched healthy individuals. Glucose and insulin levels were measured at time zero, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), whole-body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI), were calculated and the association between acute phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP) and insulin resistance was investigated. Results: There was no significant difference between study group and control group with respect to age, gender and body mass index (BMI) parameters. Insulin resistance (IR) parameters were compared within two groups and no statistical significance was determined. Groups were classified in two subgroups according to BMI value: Subgroups with BMI > 25 kg/m(2) and subgroups with BMI < 25 kg/m(2). When considered with respect to same BMI values, there was no difference between patient and control groups regarding glucose metabolism parameters and CRP levels. Insulin resistance was more evident inherently regarding BMI difference. Conclusion: It was concluded that glucose metabolisms in patients with thalassemia trait did not show difference compared to BMI-matched healthy individuals. Detecting insulin resistance to be increased in both groups as BMI increased was suggestive of main factor causing disturbances in glucose metabolism in the patients thalassemia trait was obesity.","[Isiklar, A.] Univ Hlth Sci, Fatih Sultan Mehmet Training & Res Hosp, Istanbul, Turkey; [Karsidag, K.] Istanbul Univ, Istanbul Sch Med, Istanbul, Turkey","Isiklar, A (corresponding author), E5 Highway, TR-34752 Atasehir, Turkey.",aysunisiklar@gmail.com,"Karşıdağ, Kubilay/AAD-7442-2020","Isiklar, Aysun/0000-0003-2690-3067",,,"[Anonymous], 2009, TURKIYE ENDOKRINOLO; Apostol T, 2007, EUROPEAN J HEMATOLOG, P160; BESSMAN JD, 1979, BLOOD, V53, P288, DOI 10.1182/blood.V53.2.288.28; Bolu SE, 2006, TURKIYE KLIN J INT M, V2, P; Bonora E, 1998, DIABETES CARE, V21, P221, DOI 10.2337/diacare.21.2.22; DORMER P, 1978, BRIT J HAEMATOL, V38, P; ENGLAND JM, 1973, LANCET, V1, P449, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(73)91878-; Fernandez-Real JM, 1998, DIABETES CARE, V21, P62, DOI 10.2337/diacare.21.1.6; FINCH CA, 1970, MEDICINE, V49, P17, DOI 10.1097/00005792-197001000-0000; Ford ES, 1999, DIABETES CARE, V22, P1978, DOI 10.2337/diacare.22.12.197; Iwasaki T, 2005, DIABETES CARE, V28, P2486, DOI 10.2337/diacare.28.10.248; James M, 1999, METHODS MOL MED, P8; Jiang R, 2004, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V291, P711, DOI 10.1001/jama.291.6.71; Karaaslan T., 1997, THESI; KATTAMIS C, 1972, J MED GENET, V9, P154, DOI 10.1136/jmg.9.2.15; Krentz AJ, 1996, BMJ-BRIT MED J, V313, P1385, DOI 10.1136/bmj.313.7069.138; Leila JN., 2011, AM J HE; Matsuda M, 1999, DIABETES CARE, V22, P1462, DOI 10.2337/diacare.22.9.146; Medici F, 1999, DIABETOLOGIA, V42, P146, DOI 10.1007/s00125005113; MELIS MA, 1983, BLOOD, V62, P22; MENTZER WC, 1973, LANCET, V1, P88; MERKEL PA, 1988, NEW ENGL J MED, V318, P809, DOI 10.1056/NEJM19880331318130; MOI P, 1988, BLOOD, V72, P53; Nathan DG., 1976, CIBA FDN ; Reaven G, 2003, TIP 2 DIYABET SORULA, P5; Tong PCY, 2002, DIABETES CARE, V25, P1480, DOI 10.2337/diacare.25.8.148; Van Campenhout A, 2006, DIABETES-METAB RES, V22, P444, DOI 10.1002/dmrr.63; WALFORD DM, 1977, BRIT J HAEMATOL, V35, P347, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1977.tb00593.; WICKRAMASINGHE S N, 1970, British Journal of Haematology, V19, P719, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1970.tb07017.; Wickramsinghe SN, 1973, BRIT J HAEMATOL, V25, P1; Wlazlo N, 2015, ACTA DIABETOL, V52, P337, DOI 10.1007/s00592-014-0646-; Wlazlo N, 2013, DIABETES CARE, V36, P309, DOI 10.2337/dc12-050",32,1,1,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,321.0,327,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_51,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400005,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003305785123966942,1.1649926873107479e-11,0.00639503261299277,0.10193229084399516,0.00639503261299277

Methods: 60 voluntary patients admitted to the emergency department for various reasons who had underwent contrast-enhanced computerized tomography scans were included in the study. Blood samples for NGAL, creatinine were taken . from the peripheral veins of the patients; pre exposure (0 hours) and post exposure to contrast agent on the 4th and 24th hours were examined for contrast computed tomography. Results: NGAL value was measured 4 hours after the administration of the contrast agent in our study and was significantly increased (p<0.05), however the creatinine value did not show a statistically significant change (p>0.05). When NGAL values were considered in relation to age, a significant increase was observed in patients over sixty years of age (p<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups based on the creatinine values (p>0.05). Conclusion: It was determined in the present study that NGAL indicates more significant results in comparison with creatinine with regard to the early diagnosis of contrast-induced nephropathy which can develop in patients who underwent a contrast-enhanced tomography scan. It is believed that NGAL can be the reagent which replaces creatinine in future studies for the early diagnosis of contrast-induced nephropathy particularly for patients aged 60 and above. Further investigations are required for clarifying the role of NGAL values in the early diagnosis of Contrast-Induced Nephropathy after contrast-enhanced computed tomography in Emergency Department.","[Isler, Yesim; Kaya, Halil] Saglik Bilimleri Univ, Bursa Training & Res Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Bursa, Turkey; [Ozdinc, Serife] Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Med Fac, Dept Emergency Med, Afyon, Turkey","Kaya, H (corresponding author), Saglik Bilimleri Univ, Yuksek Ihtisas Training & Res Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Fac Med, Bursa, Turkey.",drhalilkaya@gmail.com,"Kaya, Halil/ABH-5489-2020","Kaya, Halil/0000-0003-2005-6100",,,"Alharazy SM, 2014, ANGIOLOGY, V65, P216, DOI 10.1177/000331971247494; Andreoli SP, 2009, PEDIATR NEPHROL, V24, P253, DOI 10.1007/s00467-008-1074-; Bachorzewska-Gajewska H, 2007, KIDNEY BLOOD PRESS R, V30, P408, DOI 10.1159/00010910; Bachorzewska-Gajewska H, 2007, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V22, P295, DOI 10.1093/ndt/gfl40; Borregaard N, 2006, BIOMETALS, V19, P211, DOI 10.1007/s10534-005-3251-; Cruz DN, 2010, INTENS CARE MED, V36, P444, DOI 10.1007/s00134-009-1711-; Devarajan P, 2008, SCAND J CLIN LAB INV, V68, P89, DOI 10.1080/0036551080215015; Haase M, 2009, AM J KIDNEY DIS, V54, P1012, DOI 10.1053/j.ajkd.2009.07.02; Hawkins R, 2011, KOREAN J LAB MED, V31, P72, DOI 10.3343/kjlm.2011.31.2.7; Iakovou Ioannis, 2003, J Invasive Cardiol, V15, P1; McCullough PA, 2008, NEPHRON PHYSIOL, V109, pP61, DOI 10.1159/00014293; Mueller C, 2002, ARCH INTERN MED, V162, P329, DOI 10.1001/archinte.162.3.32; Sadat U., 2013, ISRN RADIOL, V2013, DOI DOI 10.5402/2013/49643; Schillinger M, 2001, J ENDOVASC THER, V8, P609, DOI 10.1583/1545-1550(2001)008<0609:PRFABA>2.0.CO;; Schmidt-Ott KM, 2006, CURR OPIN NEPHROL HY, V15, P442, DOI 10.1097/01.mnh.0000232886.81142.5; Solomon R, 2008, CLIN J AM SOC NEPHRO, V3, P1242, DOI 10.2215/CJN.0347070; Solomon R, 2007, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V22, P1812, DOI 10.1093/ndt/gfm20; Soni SS, 2010, INT UROL NEPHROL, V42, P141, DOI 10.1007/s11255-009-9608-; Tepel M, 2006, CIRCULATION, V113, P1799, DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.59509; Wagener G, 2006, ANESTHESIOLOGY, V105, P485, DOI 10.1097/00000542-200609000-0001; Yildiz Alaattin, 2003, Anadolu Kardiyol Derg, V3, P10",21,1,1,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1889.0,1894,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_293,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400044,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0022727272727272726,2.8451189377495506e-05,0.004334360236312917,0.11576039511605936,0.004334360236312917

In our study, we retrospectively reviewed 357 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who applied to our hospital between 2009 and 2016. Materials and methods: Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was applied to the patients before surgery. The ratio of neutrophil/lymphocyte (NLR) and platelet/lymphocyte (PLR) were examined at the diagnosis in relation to pathological response and surveillance. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for estimating the survival function from lifetime data. In addition, Cox regression model was also used to explore the relationship between the survival of a patient and several explanatory variables. Results: As the tumor diameter increases, the NLR increases, p value is < 0.01 and statistically significant. NLRs were not different between the tumors of T1 and T2, but for T3 and T4 tumors it was higher and more different than others (T3 = 7.0186, T4 = 12.4391). NLR was higher in patients with surgical border continuity, p = 0.01 and statistically significant. A decrease of 1 unit of NLR would increase the likelihood of a pathological good response (1/0.962) by 1.04 fold. PLR, however, is not statistically significant; it has been observed that a decrease in the 1-unit PLR tends to increase the likelihood of a good response (1/0.996) in the pathological stage by 1.004 fold. While the patients who received partial response to the treatment were living at 59 months, the patients who received good response were living at 71 months. Although p value was 0.383, a 12-month median difference in life expectancy was significant. Conclusion: It has been shown that high NLR in colorectal cancer and many other cancers is a negative prognostic factor. However, there are few articles evaluating the NLR and PLR only for rectum cancer. As in other cancers, a high PLR is associated with a pathological response in rectal cancer and poor prognosis.","[Karaca, Feryal] Hlth Sci Univ, Adana Numune Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Radiat Oncol, Adana, Turkey; [Afsar, Cigdem Usul] Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar Univ, Dept Internal Med & Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey","Afsar, CU (corresponding author), Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar Univ, Acibadem Bakirkoy Hosp, Dept Internal Med & Med Oncol, Zeytinlik Mah Halit Ziya Usakligil Cad 1, TR-34140 Istanbul, Turkey.",cigdemusul@yahoo.com,"Afsar, Cigdem Usul/C-3436-2015; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/AAA-6103-2021","Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639",,,"Alexandrakis MG, 2003, AM J CLIN ONCOL-CANC, V26, P135, DOI 10.1097/00000421-200304000-0000; Azab B, 2014, CANCER BIOMARK, V14, P303, DOI 10.3233/CBM-14041; Buttner S, 2017, ACTA CHIR BELG, V117, P181, DOI 10.1080/00015458.2017.127987; Coussens LM, 2002, NATURE, V420, P860, DOI 10.1038/nature0132; de Martino M, 2013, J UROLOGY, V190, P1999, DOI 10.1016/j.juro.2013.06.08; Fridlender ZG, 2012, CARCINOGENESIS, V33, P949, DOI 10.1093/carcin/bgs12; Graziosi L, 2015, AM J SURG, V209, P333, DOI 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2014.06.01; Guthrie GJK, 2013, CRIT REV ONCOL HEMAT, V88, P218, DOI 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2013.03.01; Lu HT, 2006, MOL CANCER RES, V4, P221, DOI 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-026; Marmol I, 2017, INT J MOL SCI, V18, DOI 10.3390/ijms1801019; Moody GA, 1996, EUR J GASTROEN HEPAT, V8, P1179, DOI 10.1097/00042737-199612000-0000; Proctor MJ, 2011, EUR J CANCER, V47, P2633, DOI 10.1016/j.ejca.2011.03.02; Roxburgh CSD, 2014, BRIT J CANCER, V110, P1409, DOI 10.1038/bjc.2014.9; Seril DN, 2003, CARCINOGENESIS, V24, P353, DOI 10.1093/carcin/24.3.35; Shibutani M, 2013, ANTICANCER RES, V33, P329; Tazzyman S, 2009, INT J EXP PATHOL, V90, P222, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2613.2009.00641.; Templeton AJ, 2014, JNCI-J NATL CANCER I, V106, DOI 10.1093/jnci/dju12",17,0,0,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1383.0,1390,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_211,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700033,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001756198347107438,1.17299693739569e-11,0.06286308884566773,0.11308014906019649,0.06378421193800152

Copeptin is a glycopeptide derived from a pre-pro-hormone, which directly mirrors AVP levels. Copeptin has been shown to be elevated in various infectious and noninfectious diseases, and in acute pancreatitis. The present study aimed to examine copeptin in mild acute pancreatitis patients and to investigate it as a severity index. Materials and methods: This prospective study included 32 patients admitted to the hospital with mild acute pancreatitis, and 30 healthy volunteers. Independent sample t test and Pearson's correlation test were used for statistical evaluation. Results: Serum copeptin level was 0.539 +/- 0.076 ng/mL in mild acute pancreatitis patients and was not statistically significantly different than the control group (0.544 +/- 0.061 ng/mL). On correlation analysis serum copeptin level was not associated with the known prognosis factors. Conclusion: Previous studies have found that copeptin may be used as a prognostic factor, but our study could not find an increase in mild acute pancreatitis patients or a correlation between copeptin level and other known prognostic factors. Further studies are needed to use copeptin in diagnosis or prognosis prediction in acute pancreatitis.","[Koseoglu, Huseyin] Ankara Ataturk Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Bilkent, Turkey; [Alisik, Murat] Ankara Ataturk Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Clin Biochem, Bilkent, Turkey; [Solakoglu, Tevfik] Corlu State Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Corlu, Turkey; [Tahtaci, Mustafa; Ersoy, Osman] Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Dept Gastroenterol, Fac Med, Ankara, Turkey; [Erel, Ozcan] Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Dept Clin Biochem, Fac Med, Ankara, Turkey","Koseoglu, H (corresponding author), Univ Mh Bilkent, Ataturk Egitim & Arastirma Hastanesi, Ankara Ataturk Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Cad 1, Bilkent, Turkey.",huseyinko@yahoo.com,"Ertan, Asli/AAE-6201-2021; Alisik, Murat/O-6114-2019; EREL, Ozcan/U-1008-2019; koseoglu, huseyin/A-2449-2017","Alisik, Murat/0000-0003-0434-3206; EREL, Ozcan/0000-0002-2996-3236; ",,,"Banks PA, 2013, GUT, V62, P102, DOI 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-30277; Chen YH, 2015, MEDICINE, V94, DOI 10.1097/MD.000000000000063; Choi KS, 2015, SCI REP-UK, V5, DOI 10.1038/srep1166; Dobsa L, 2013, BIOCHEM MEDICA, V23, P172, DOI 10.11613/BM.2013.02; Hamada T, 2013, J GASTROENTEROL, V48, P1384, DOI 10.1007/s00535-013-0765-; Isman FK, 2013, AM J EMERG MED, V31, P690, DOI 10.1016/j.ajem.2012.12.01; Jochberger S, 2009, CRIT CARE MED, V37, P476, DOI 10.1097/CCM.0b013e318195753; Katan M, 2008, CRIT CARE, V12, DOI 10.1186/cc679; Kruger S, 2007, INTENS CARE MED, V33, P2069, DOI 10.1007/s00134-007-0895-; Moreno JP, 2013, LIVER INT, V33, P843, DOI 10.1111/liv.1217; Morgenthaler NG, 2008, TRENDS ENDOCRIN MET, V19, P43, DOI 10.1016/j.tem.2007.11.00; Ray P, 2012, AM J EMERG MED, V30, P440, DOI 10.1016/j.ajem.2011.12.00; Reichlin T, 2009, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V54, P60, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2009.01.07; Sang G, 2014, PEPTIDES, V51, P4, DOI 10.1016/j.peptides.2013.10.01; Stoiser B, 2006, EUR J CLIN INVEST, V36, P771, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2006.01724.; Struck J, 2005, PEPTIDES, V26, P2500, DOI 10.1016/j.peptides.2005.04.01; Szinnai G, 2007, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V92, P3973, DOI 10.1210/jc.2007-023; Tenner S, 2013, AM J GASTROENTEROL, V108, P1400, DOI 10.1038/ajg.2013.21; Vege SS, 2009, AM J GASTROENTEROL, V104, P710, DOI 10.1038/ajg.2008.7; Zweifel C, 2010, BMC NEUROL, V10, DOI 10.1186/1471-2377-10-3",20,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1327.0,1330,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_203,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700025,,,,,2022-07-14,0.002066115702479339,8.386625898495028e-30,0.009677763651220713,0.05156204224039204,0.009677763651220713

This study aimed to investigate the effect of a short-term occlusal splint therapy in patients with SB, evaluating both the nocturnal electromyographic (EMG) activity of the temporalis muscle through a portable EMG recording device and the migraine SB-related severity and discomfort. Materials and methods: Sixty patients with SB were randomized into 2 equal groups, a group treated with an occlusal splint and an untreated control group for a study period of two weeks. EMG activity during sleep was recorded from the right side of anterior temporalis muscle with a portable electromyographic recording device. Outcomes of interest were the differences in bruxism activity (number of EMG events/hour) Bruxism length (Second/event) and migraine disability score (MIDAS) between the two groups. Results: After the 2-weeks study period the bruxism activity and length decreased significantly (p = 0.006 and p = 0.037, respectively) as well as the MIDAS grading (p < 0.05) in the treatment group compared with control group. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the short-term use of occlusal splint therapy is effective in reducing both SB activity and migraine SB-related discomfort, with a positive and rapid relaxing action of the masticatory muscles.","[La Mantia, Ignazio; Grillo, Calogero] GF Ingrassia Univ Catania, Dept Med Sci Surg & Adv Technol, Via Santa Sofia 78, I-95123 Catania, Italy; [Andaloro, Claudio] Santa Marta & Santa Venera Hosp, ENT Unit, Catania, Italy","La Mantia, I (corresponding author), GF Ingrassia Univ Catania, Dept Med Sci Surg & Adv Technol, Via Santa Sofia 78, I-95123 Catania, Italy.",,"Andaloro, Claudio/J-7079-2019","Andaloro, Claudio/0000-0003-0274-6247",,,"American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2014, AM ACAD SLEEP ME; Andaloro C, 2017, MINERVA GASTROENTERO, V63, P307, DOI 10.23736/S1121-421X.17.02403-; Balasubramaniam R., 2014, J DENT SLEEP MED, V1, DOI [10.15331/jdsm.3736, DOI 10.15331/JDSM.3736, DOI 10.15331/jdsm.3736; Carra MC, 2013, SLEEP MED, V14, P656, DOI 10.1016/j.sleep.2013.03.00; Daif ET, 2012, ACTA ODONTOL SCAND, V70, P72, DOI 10.3109/00016357.2011.59777; Dube C, 2004, J DENT RES, V83, P398, DOI 10.1177/15440591040830050; Fernandes G, 2013, J OROFAC PAIN, V27, P14, DOI 10.11607/jop.92; Frati F, 2014, J INVEST ALLERG CLIN, V24, P35; Goncalves DAG, 2010, HEADACHE, V50, P231, DOI 10.1111/j.1526-4610.2009.01511.; Grillo C, 2004, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V20, P15; Harada T, 2006, J ORAL REHABIL, V33, P482, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2842.2005.01576.; HOLMGREN K, 1993, J PROSTHET DENT, V69, P293, DOI 10.1016/0022-3913(93)90109-; Hosoya H, 2014, SLEEP BREATH, V18, P837, DOI 10.1007/s11325-014-0953-; Jagger Robert, 2008, Evid Based Dent, V9, P23, DOI 10.1038/sj.ebd.640056; Koyano K, 2005, INT J PROSTHODONT, V18, P29; La Mantia I, 2017, EMBJ, V12, P14; La Mantia I, 2017, AM J RHINOL ALLERG; Landry-Schonbeck A, 2009, INT J PROSTHODONT, V22, P25; Lavigne GJ, 2001, J SLEEP RES, V10, P237, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2869.2001.00261.; Lobbezoo F, 2006, J ORAL REHABIL, V33, P293, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2842.2006.01609.; Macedo CR, 2007, COCHRANE DB SYST REV, DOI 10.1002/14651858.CD005514.pub; Manfredini D, 2013, J ORAL REHABIL, V40, P631, DOI 10.1111/joor.1206; Manfredini D, 2015, J ORAL REHABIL, V42, P862, DOI 10.1111/joor.1232; Manfredini D, 2013, J OROFAC PAIN, V27, P99, DOI 10.11607/jop.92; Matsumoto H, 2015, J ORAL REHABIL, V42, P251, DOI 10.1111/joor.1225; Mitrirattanakul S, 2002, J DENT RES, V81, pA13; Miyawaki S, 2003, SLEEP, V26, P888, DOI 10.1093/sleep/26.7.88; Savabi O, 2007, QUINTESSENCE INT, V38, P12; Shetty Shilpa, 2010, J Indian Prosthodont Soc, V10, P141, DOI 10.1007/s13191-011-0041-; Stapelmann Henrike, 2008, BMC Oral Health, V8, P22, DOI 10.1186/1472-6831-8-2; Stuginski-Barbosa J, 2016, SLEEP BREATH, V20, P695, DOI 10.1007/s11325-015-1283-; Troeltzsch M, 2011, J PROSTHET DENT, V105, P410, DOI 10.1016/S0022-3913(11)60084-; Yap Adrian U, 2016, J Conserv Dent, V19, P383, DOI 10.4103/0972-0707.19000; Yap AUJ, 1998, J ORAL REHABIL, V25, P6",34,1,1,0,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,301.0,305,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_48,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400002,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003512396694214876,3.450575285451635e-05,0.018065146007786588,0.09263955747384943,0.018065146007786588

Study group (10 patients) was treated with VFE+VH approach and control group (9 patients) was treated with a VH alone therapy; both interventions started one month following radiotherapy completion and lasted for 6 weeks. Voice Handicap Index (VHI) scores, laryngeal stroboscopy, high-speed laryngeal imaging, acoustic analysis, aerodynamic analysis, auditory-perceptual measures through the Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain (GRBAS) rating scale and impact on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) through the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck module (EORTC QLQ-H&N35) were evaluated at baseline and post-intervention. Results: VFE+VH combined approach shows better and statistically significant improvement after vocal intervention when compared to VH alone group for VHI (p=0.023), GRBAS (p=0.038), MPT (p<0.001), jitter (p=0.015), NMWA (p=0.011), NGG (p=0.026) and EORTC QLQ-H& N35 (p=0.047). Conclusions: The current investigation demonstrated that the VFE+VH combined approach was effective in improving the vocal function in irradiated patients with laryngeal cancers.","[La Mantia, Ignazio] Univ Catania, Dept Med Sci Surg & Adv Technol, Catania, Italy; [Cupido, Francesco] Univ Palermo, Dept Surg & Oncol Disciplines, Palermo, Italy; [Andaloro, Claudio] Santa Marta & Santa Venera Hosp, Ear Nose & Throat Unit, Catania, Italy","La Mantia, I (corresponding author), Dept Med Sci Surg & Adv Technol, Via Santa Sofia 78, I-95123 Catania, Italy.",,"Andaloro, Claudio/J-7079-2019","Andaloro, Claudio/0000-0003-0274-6247",,,"Angadi V, 2017, ANN OTO RHINOL LARYN, V126, P483, DOI 10.1177/000348941770292; Bergstrom L, 2016, LARYNGOSCOPE, V126, P2029, DOI 10.1002/lary.2591; Frati F, 2014, J INVEST ALLERG CLIN, V24, P35; Grillo C., 2017, OTORINOLARINGOL, V67, P7; Grillo C, 2004, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V20, P15; Hirano M, 1981, PSYCHOACOUSTIC EVAL; Hocevar-Boltezar I, 2009, RADIOTHER ONCOL, V93, P524, DOI 10.1016/j.radonc.2009.09.01; HONG WK, 1993, CANCER RES, V53, P511; Jacobson BH, 1997, AM J SPEECH-LANG PAT, V6, P66, DOI [10.1044/1058-0360.0603.66, DOI 10.1044/1058-0360.0603.66; Kobayashi T, 2017, AURIS NASUS LARYNX, V44, P86, DOI 10.1016/j.anl.2016.04.00; La Mantia I, 2017, EGYPTIAN J EAR NOSE, V18, P24; Lazarus CL, 2009, CURR OPIN OTOLARYNGO, V17, P172, DOI 10.1097/MOO.0b013e32832af12; Lim H.

The aim of this study was to assess olfactory function in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR), non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) and mixed rhinitis (MR). Materials and methods: A total of 122 patients with AR, NAR, and MR were included in the study. Sniffin' Sticks test was applied to all groups. The study groups were compared in terms of odor scores and an association between olfactory dysfunction and rhinitis grading, according to ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma) criteria, was also investigated. Results: A significant difference was observed between NAR patients and the two other study groups with respect to all odor scores. TDI (Threshold, Discrimination, Identification) score, for overall olfactory function, resulted significantly lower in NAR patients than that in the other two groups (P=0.038). Conversely, no significant difference was observed between patients with AR and MR. Consistent with ARIA classification, NAR patients suffered mostly from persistent symptoms, whereas, AR patients generally suffered by intermittent symptoms, as well as MR patients, but this last with a significative higher presence of patients with persistent symptoms, when compared to AR group (P<0.05). A significative association was also observed between lower TDI scores and presence of persistent rhinitis symptomatology (P<0.001). Conclusions: Impaired olfaction is a feature more evident in NAR patients when compared to the other rhinitis subtype and it was much more affected by longer duration of rhinitis symptomatology rather than severity.","[La Mantia, Ignazio; Castro, Veronica] Univ Catania, Dept Med Sci Surg & Adv Technol, Catania, Italy; [Cupido, Francesco] Univ Palermo, Dept Surg & Oncol Disciplines, Palermo, Italy; [Andaloro, Claudio] Santa Marta & Santa Venera Hosp, Ear Nose & Throat Unit, Catania, Italy","La Mantia, I (corresponding author), Dept Med Sci Surg & Adv Technol, Via Santa Sofia 78, I-95123 Catania, Italy.",,"Andaloro, Claudio/J-7079-2019","Andaloro, Claudio/0000-0003-0274-6247",,,"Apter AJ, 1999, ARCH OTOLARYNGOL, V125, P1005, DOI 10.1001/archotol.125.9.100; Asher MI, 2006, LANCET, V368, P733, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69283-; Becker S, 2012, ACTA OTO-LARYNGOL, V132, P763, DOI 10.3109/00016489.2012.65676; Bernstein JA, 2010, ALLERGY ASTHMA PROC, V31, P365, DOI 10.2500/aap.2010.31.338; Bousquet J, 2001, J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUN, V108, pS147, DOI 10.1067/mai.2001.11889; Bramerson A, 2004, LARYNGOSCOPE, V114, P73; Ciprandi G, 2017, ALLERGY ASTHMA CL IM, V13, DOI 10.1186/s13223-017-0185-; Dinc ME, 2017, ACTA OTO-LARYNGOL, V137, P71, DOI 10.1080/00016489.2016.121131; Doty RL, 2001, LARYNGOSCOPE, V111, P409, DOI 10.1097/00005537-200103000-0000; Frati F, 2014, J INVEST ALLERG CLIN, V24, P35; Greiwe J, 2016, IMMUNOL ALLERGY CLIN, V36, P289, DOI 10.1016/j.iac.2015.12.00; Grillo C, 2004, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V20, P15; Guilemany JM, 2009, LARYNGOSCOPE, V119, P233, DOI 10.1002/lary.2007; Guss J, 2009, ORL-J OTO-RHIN-LARYN, V71, P268, DOI 10.1159/00024242; Higo R, 1996, Nihon Jibiinkoka Gakkai Kaiho, V99, P164; Hummel T, 2005, ACTA OTO-LARYNGOL, V125, P116, DOI 10.1080/0001648041002278; Hummel T, 1997, CHEM SENSES, V22, P39, DOI 10.1093/chemse/22.1.3; La Mantia I, 2017, EMBJ, V12, P14; La Mantia I, 2017, AM J RHINOL ALLERGY, V31, P364, DOI 10.2500/ajra.2017.31.448; La Mantia I, 2017, EURASIAN J MED, V49, P220, DOI 10.5152/eurasianjmed.2017.1725; La Mantia I, 2017, INT J PEDIATR OTORHI, V98, P103, DOI 10.1016/j.ijporl.2017.04.04; Lee CH, 2008, CLIN EXP OTORHINOLAR, V1, P196, DOI 10.3342/ceo.2008.1.4.19; Mann S.

Enuresis is characterized by the involuntary urination in the absence of a physical disorder, socially unacceptable in places and at one stage of life where such control is acquired by the majority of subjects (about 5 years). The present study aims to evaluate the visuospatial skills in children affected by primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (PMNE). 31 PMNE children (16 males and 15 females) (mean age 10.87, SD +/- 1.68) and 61 healthy children (32 males, 29 females) (mean age 11.03, SD +/- 1.85, p = 0687) were evaluated for visuomotor skills with the Visual-Motor Integration Scale (VMI). PMNE subjects show a worse performance on average to VMI, especially in the total visual-motor integration test.

Methods: The 400 patients receiving 320-slice spiral CT of lower limb arterial imaging examination in our hospital from March 2014 to March 2016 were included in the study. The differences in relevant parameters of general data, clinical manifestation and scanning were analyzed, the specific factors affecting lower limb artery imaging quality were analyzed; According to the standard of spiral CT imaging, arterial stenosis of the patients was divided into 4 levels by considering ,general data, respectively less than 50%, 50%-75%, 76% -99%, occlusion. The specific of feet of lower limb artery imaging by 320 - slice spiral CT under different grades of arterial stenosis was analyzed. Results: As can be seen from the imaging results, the higher the level of arterial stenosis is, the higher the sensitivity and specificity of 320-slice spiral CT in evaluation of lower limb artery imaging is, especially sensitivity. There are significant differences between the different levels (P <0.05); The imaging quality of lower limb artery by 320 - slice spiral CT is affected by such factors as contrast agent velocity, contrast agent concentration, contrast agent dose, delay time, scanning parameters, vascular calcification, patient age and reconstruction technique (P <0.05). Conclusion: Lower limb artery imaging by 320 - slice spiral CT has a high sensitivity and specificity, which enjoys great value in clinical application.","[Li, Feng; Wang, Jingzhong; Cao, Feng; Chen, Hui; Wang, Wanbi] Hubei Univ Arts & Sci, Affiliated Hosp, Xiangyang Cent Hosp, Radiol Dept, Xiangyang 441021, Peoples R China","Cao, F (corresponding author), Hubei Univ Arts & Sci, Affiliated Hosp, Xiangyang Cent Hosp, Radiol Dept, Xiangyang 441021, Peoples R China.",caof77210@163.com,,,Research project of Heilongjiang Provincial Health Bureau [2014-007],Research project of Heilongjiang Provincial Health Bureau; Application of 640 slice CT low dose scanning technique in abdominal and lower extremity arterial imaging (No. 2014-007).,"Balkhair KS, 2016, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V23, pS32, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2015.09.02; Ganeshpurkar A, 2017, SAUDI PHARM J, V25, P149, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2016.04.02; Gao W, 2017, SAUDI PHARM J, V25, P580, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2017.04.02; Guowei Ye, COMP ANAL 4 IMAGIN; Huang HQ, 2015, J COASTAL RES, P698, DOI 10.2112/SI73-120.; Maltese A, 2017, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V33, P667, DOI 10.19193/03936384_2017_4_10; Mohammed MJ, 2017, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V24, P737, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2017.01.05; Obeidat HR, 2015, SAUDI PHARM J, V23, P455, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2014.11.00; Peng WX, 2016, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V23, P348, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2015.10.02; Wang L.-L., 2010, CHINESE MED EQUIPMEN, V31, P1; Wei Li, 2009, J HAINAN MED U, V15, P101; Wei Xia, 2014, CHINESE J MED IMAGIN, V10, P84; Wu K, 2015, J COASTAL RES, P521, DOI 10.2112/SI73-091.; Zhang J, 2015, J COASTAL RES, P652, DOI 10.2112/SI73-113.; Zhang M, 2015, J COASTAL RES, P304, DOI 10.2112/SI73-053.; Zhang XY, 2015, J COASTAL RES, P9, DOI 10.2112/SI73-003.; Zhao N, 2015, J COASTAL RES, P220, DOI 10.2112/SI73-039.; [周淑琴 Zhou Shuqin], 2013, [中华放射医学与防护杂志, Chinese Journal of Radiological Medicine and Protection], V33, P31",18,0,0,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1937.0,1941,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_301,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400052,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001859504132231405,0.0009454975010808015,0.020285195292435432,0.10018525993314083,0.02613938901357729

In this paper, the research method was to establish a dynamic and quantitative test model for testing muscle strength training and the biomechanical property of an alive rat, and conducted cyclical eccentric strength training for ankle joint dorsal muscle group of SD male rats under two groups of different applied loads. According to the research results, it can be seen that after eccentric movement, the difference in terms of structure, serum ck, biomechanical property of rat muscle between high tension group and low tension group was not of statistic significance, P>0.05. It can conclude that the high tension, which was resulted by eccentric contraction, was the primary factor to cause exercise-induced muscle injury.","[Li, Jing] Jilin Sport Univ, Sch Sports Human Sci, Changchun 130022, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shitao] Jilin Sport Univ, Sch Sports & Arts, Changchun 130022, Peoples R China","Wang, ST (corresponding author), Jilin Sport Univ, Sch Sports & Arts, Changchun 130022, Peoples R China.",wst-0223@163.com,,,Jilin Social Science Fund Project - Research on the health industry of the elderly [2017M16],Jilin Social Science Fund Project - Research on the health industry of the elderly (No. 2017M16).,"Alanazi K, 2016, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V23, P87, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2015.09.00; Amr AEGE, 2017, PAK J PHARM SCI, V30, P83; Bassi P, 2017, SAUDI PHARM J, V25, P32, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2015.06.00; Cahill T., 2015, ASIAN PAC J SURG ONC, V1, P4; Ge SB, 2017, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V24, P1355, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2016.09.01; Jin QG, 2010, CHIN SPORTS SCI, V30, P7; Kos M, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P21; [赖桂华 Lai Guihua], 2015, [中国临床解剖学杂志, Chinese Journal of Clinical Anatomy], V33, P54; Lee R., 2015, ASIAN PAC J SURG ONC, V1, P3; Shahid B, 2015, PAK J PHARM SCI, V28, P9; Sharma M, 2015, SAUDI PHARM J, V23, P675, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2015.02.01; Song HM, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P30; Wang Dapeng, 2016, CHINESE J TISSUE ENG, V20, P27; Wang M, 2018, J CLEAN PROD, V179, P12, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.09; Wang YM, 2017, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V24, P837, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2016.12.00; Zhang M, 2015, J COASTAL RES, P304, DOI 10.2112/SI73-053.; Zhang Yipeng, 2013, RES INTEGRATED TRADI, V5, P22; Zhen-Ying Zhang, 2007, Shengli Xuebao, V59, P64",18,0,0,2,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,3.0,,1565.0,1569,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3s_242,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GP7NG,WOS:000441088400018,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001859504132231405,7.121812571858015e-07,0.0047335239075686885,0.08589098588300015,0.004249954361615776

Thorough explore of problems will benefit SLE patient's needs determination, resources allocation, rehabilitation and outcomes assessment. Therefore, there was a need for an instrument that can conduct a comprehensive investigation of SLE people's experienced problems. To identify SLE patients' function, disability and health problems and to provide references for the future development of SLE core sets. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the rheumatology outpatient in one general hospital in China. 100 SLE patients' function, disability and health problems were collected using expanded ICF checklist. Descriptive analysis was performed to summarize the data. Of the 150 categories, 55 categories were relevant to at least 20% of the patients, 28 from body functions and structures component, 14 from activities and participation component and 13 from environmental factors component. The mostly referred problems were fatiguability (96%) in body functions, joints (76%) in body structures. The most restricted activity was remunerative employment (71%), and patients' mostly important facilitator was immediate family (47%), mostly referred barrier was light (96%). In conclusion, a large variety of problems were identified, reflecting the complexity of the lived experiences of SLE patients, and intervention should be taken based on those relevant categories. And this study also can serve as a reference for future development of SLE core set.","[Li, Wei; Feng, Chenchen; He, Xiaoli; Wu, Yan; Wu, Juan; Hu, Xiaokun; Zhao, Shuzhen] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Zhao, SZ (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Outpatient Dept, 37 Guoxue Lane, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",ssszszzsz@126.com,,,,,"Anic F, 2014, CROAT MED J, V55, P514, DOI 10.3325/cmj.2014.55.51; Askanase A, 2012, SOC WORK HEALTH CARE, V51, P576, DOI 10.1080/00981389.2012.68336; Barbasio C, 2015, COMPR PSYCHIAT, V63, P88, DOI 10.1016/j.comppsych.2015.09.00; Bauernfeind B, 2009, ARTHRIT RHEUM-ARTHR, V61, P21, DOI 10.1002/art.2416; Bickenbach J., 2012, ICF CORE SETS MANUA; BOMBARDIER C, 1992, ARTHRITIS RHEUM, V35, P630, DOI 10.1002/art.178035060; Brennan KAM, 2016, QUAL LIFE RES, V25, P1227, DOI 10.1007/s11136-015-1151-; BUYSSE DJ, 1989, PSYCHIAT RES, V28, P193, DOI 10.1016/0165-1781(89)90047-; Chen HH, 2017, CLIN RHEUMATOL, V36, P133, DOI 10.1007/s10067-016-3471-; Cieza A, 2005, J REHABIL MED, V37, P212, DOI 10.1080/1650197051004026; Cieza A, 2002, J REHABIL MED, V34, P205, DOI 10.1080/16501970276027918; Cieza A, 2019, DISABIL REHABIL, V41, P574, DOI 10.3109/09638288.2016.114525; Cleanthous S, 2012, LUPUS, V21, P465, DOI 10.1177/096120331243686; Garcia-Carrasco M, 2012, LUPUS, V21, P1219, DOI 10.1177/096120331245674; Gladman D, 1996, ARTHRITIS RHEUM, V39, P363, DOI 10.1002/art.178039030; Gradinger F, 2011, J SLEEP RES, V20, P445, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2869.2010.00888.; Kasitanon N, 2013, LUPUS, V22, P1353, DOI 10.1177/096120331350735; KRUPP LB, 1989, ARCH NEUROL-CHICAGO, V46, P1121, DOI 10.1001/archneur.1989.0052046011502; Kuhn A, 2015, DTSCH ARZTEBL INT, V112, P423, DOI 10.3238/arztebl.2015.042; Leong KP, 2005, RHEUMATOLOGY, V44, P1267, DOI 10.1093/rheumatology/keh60; Leuchten N, 2014, ARTHRIT CARE RES, V66, P1895, DOI 10.1002/acr.2237; LIANG MH, 1989, ARTHRITIS RHEUM, V32, P1107, DOI 10.1002/anr.178032090; Mazzoni D, 2011, LUPUS, V20, P1117, DOI 10.1177/096120331141299; Mazzoni D, 2016, ANXIETY STRESS COPIN, V29, P542, DOI 10.1080/10615806.2015.113478; McElhone K, 2007, ARTHRIT RHEUM-ARTHR, V57, P972, DOI 10.1002/art.2288; Mirbagher L., 2014, INT J RHEUM DIS, V19, P305, DOI 10.1111/1756-185x.1241; Nowicka-Sauer K, 2007, CLIN RHEUMATOL, V26, P1523, DOI 10.1007/s10067-007-0619-; Oner FC, 2015, SPINE, V40, P1371, DOI 10.1097/BRS.000000000000100; Palagini L, 2014, LUPUS, V23, P115, DOI 10.1177/096120331351862; Pons-Estel GJ, 2010, SEMIN ARTHRITIS RHEU, V39, P257, DOI 10.1016/j.semarthrit.2008.10.00; Schmeding A, 2013, BEST PRACT RES CL RH, V27, P363, DOI 10.1016/j.berh.2013.07.00; Selb M, 2015, EUR J PHYS REHAB MED, V51, P10; Shariati-Sarabi Z, 2013, CLIN EXP RHEUMATOL, V31, P6; Stamm TA, 2007, ARTHRIT RHEUM-ARTHR, V57, P1287, DOI 10.1002/art.2301; Sterling KL, 2014, LUPUS, V23, P124, DOI 10.1177/096120331351155; Stucki G, 2004, ANN RHEUM DIS, V63, P40, DOI 10.1136/ard.2004.02823; Stucki G, 2004, J REHABIL MED, V36, P5, DOI 10.1080/1650196041002230; SYMMONS DPM, 1988, Q J MED, V69, P92; Tsutsui H, 2015, CLIN EXP NEPHROL, V19, P254, DOI 10.1007/s10157-014-0983-; Ustun B, 2004, J REHABIL MED, V36, P7, DOI 10.1080/1650196041001534; Vina ER, 2013, JCR-J CLIN RHEUMATOL, V19, P7, DOI 10.1097/RHU.0b013e31827cd20; W.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of drug usage in Chinese hypertensive patients. Methodology: Patients data with drug usage were collected from Shenzhen in China. Student' t test was used to compare the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) differences. Results: A total of 58,971 hypertensive patients and 12,732 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes were studied. The abnormal DBP (mean: 81 mmHg) and SBP (mean: above 130 mmHg) observed in two groups indicated both populations were correctly diagnosed with hypertension. Those hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes got significant higher SBP (mean: 133 mmHg), suggesting they were more severe. After a period of at least 3 years follow up investigations, the SBP of patients with only hypertension dropped to a mean value of 129 mmHg. Hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes also showed significant SBP decreasing changes, with the mean of SBP around 130 mmHg.

In this research, seventy mature male rabbits were divided randomly and equally into 7 groups with each group containing 10 rabbits. All the mature male rabbits were participated in the passive running and jumping before they undergone the radio nuclide bone imaging and tibial X-ray findings. The histological and electron microscopic changes were observed, and each of the parathyroid hormone (PTH), osteocalcin (BGP) and testosterone concentration (T) was measured. After 2 weeks of continuous stimulation, the trends of stress injury in osteocytes, serum parathyroid hormone and osteocalcin have increased, while serum testosterone is showing an obvious decreasing trend. After three to four weeks, the X-ray, radionuclide bone imaging, histology, and blood biochemistry were carried out on the rabbits. The results showed stress injuries have occurred in the rabbits. In the two medication groups, the X-ray and nuclide bone showed the formation of new bone in the cortex; osteoblastic phase existed in bone cells; serum parathyroid hormone decreased significantly; while serum osteocalcin and blood testosterone level of the rabbits were higher as compared to exercise group in the same week. It can be concluded that Bushen Jianpi Huoxue recipe can be used to treat the tibial stress injury in rabbits effectively by stimulating the new bone formation and enhance the blood testosterone level.","[Liu, Kun] Soochow Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Suzhou 215021, Peoples R China; [Liu, Kun] Jiangxi Univ Tradit Chinese Med, PE Dept, Nanchang 330004, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","Liu, K (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Suzhou 215021, Peoples R China.;Liu, K (corresponding author), Jiangxi Univ Tradit Chinese Med, PE Dept, Nanchang 330004, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",liuk0791@163.com,,,,,"Attari Z, 2016, SAUDI PHARM J, V24, P57, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2015.03.00; Balkhair KS, 2016, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V23, pS83, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2015.10.02; Cankilic MY, 2017, BIOMED RES-INDIA, V28, P310; Chen You-xue, 2008, Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Xue Bao, V6, P738, DOI 10.3736/jcim2008071; Ding X.

However, so far we are not know the orange whether effective reduce the incidence of typeIIdiabetes so the target of this study was to review and conduct quantitative analyses of the results from expected cohort researches which assessed the correlation between the citrus ingestion and the risk of typeII diabetes. Materials and methods: The research team identified the pertinent studies by a systematical search in PubMed, Embase, Science Direct and Cochrane Library up to May 2017. Furthermore, the reseachers also used the random-effect model to combine the study-specific results and the subgroup analyses. Sensitivity analyses were also carried out. Researchers used the funnel plot of beg for estimating publication bias. Publication bias was estimated by using Begg's funnel plot. Results: This study selected a total 13 prospective studies that included 415462 participants from eight publications. The combined relative risk (RR) of type II diabetes for the highest versus the lowest category of the citrus fruit intake were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.78-0.92; p = 0.0001) for the incidence of all typeII diabetes events, and the correlation of subgroup analysis with sex, region, duration of follow-up, amount of cases and study quality was highly consistent with the overall data. For female subjects, there are exsit significant protective associations that between the citrus intake and the type II diabetes risk (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73-0.93; p = 0.000). The studies with follow-up were longer than 10 years (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73-0.89; p = 0.001). No publication bias was found. Conclusions: These results indicate that the consumption of citrusis inversely correlated with the risk of typeIIdiabetes, especially for female.","[Kou, Guang-Ning] Southwest Univ, Coll Hort & Landscape Architecture, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Meng; Lv, Bing-Qiang; Qin, Chun-Li] Chongqing Adm Sport, Chongqing Inst Sport Sci, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Kou, Guang-Ning] Chongqing Southwest Inst Fruit Nutr, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Meng; Lv, Bing-Qiang; Qin, Chun-Li; Kou, Guang-Ning] Lab Phys Fitness Evaluat & Performance Monitoring, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Gao, Bing-Hong; Kou, Guang-Ning] Shanghai Sport Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Kou, GN (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Coll Hort & Landscape Architecture, Chongqing, Peoples R China.;Kou, GN (corresponding author), Chongqing Southwest Inst Fruit Nutr, Chongqing, Peoples R China.;Kou, GN (corresponding author), Lab Phys Fitness Evaluat & Performance Monitoring, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",kouguangning@sina.com,,,Chongqing program for production of late maturing Citrus fruits [20184-4]; Chongqing sports bureau RD project [A2017014]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [XDJK2017D087],This work was financially supported by Chongqing program for production of late maturing Citrus fruits (20184-4); Chongqing sports bureau R&D project (A2017014); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (XDJK2017D087).,"Alwan A, 2011, GLOBAL STATUS REPORT ON NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES 2010, P; Boeing H, 2013, EUR J CLIN NUTR, V67, P424, DOI 10.1038/ejcn.2013.4; Carter Patrice, 2010, BMJ, V341, pc4229, DOI 10.1136/bmj.c422; Ceriello A, 2004, ARTERIOSCL THROM VAS, V24, P816, DOI 10.1161/01.ATV.0000122852.22604.7; Chen LW, 2012, DIABETES CARE, V35, P1079, DOI 10.2337/dc11-210; Cooper AJ, 2012, EUR J CLIN NUTR, V66, P1082, DOI 10.1038/ejcn.2012.8; Danaei G, 2011, LANCET, V378, P31, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60679-; Dauchet L, 2006, J NUTR, V136, P2588, DOI 10.1093/jn/136.10.258; Egger M, 1997, BMJ-BRIT MED J, V315, P629, DOI 10.1136/bmj.315.7109.62; Gillies CL, 2007, BMJ-BRIT MED J, V334, P299, DOI 10.1136/bmj.39063.689375.5; Gordon MH, 1996, NAT PROD REP, V13, P265, DOI 10.1039/np996130026; Guariguata L, 2014, DIABETES RES CLIN PR, V103, P137, DOI 10.1016/j.diabres.2013.11.00; Hamer M, 2007, J HYPERTENS, V25, P2361, DOI 10.1097/HJH.0b013e3282efc21; Harding AH, 2008, ARCH INTERN MED, V168, P1493, DOI 10.1001/archinte.168.14.149; He FJ, 2006, LANCET, V367, P320, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68069-; Holt EM, 2009, J AM DIET ASSOC, V109, P414, DOI 10.1016/j.jada.2008.11.03; Keogh RH, 2013, STAT MED, V32, P3838, DOI 10.1002/sim.580; Kurotani K, 2013, BRIT J NUTR, V109, P709, DOI 10.1017/S000711451200170; Lattimer JM, 2010, NUTRIENTS, V2, P1266, DOI 10.3390/nu212126; Li J, 2014, EUR REV MED PHARMACO, V18, P177; Li S, 2017, EUR REV MED PHARMACO, V21, P349; Li SS, 2015, ENDOCRINE, V48, P454, DOI 10.1007/s12020-014-0351-; Liese AD, 2003, AM J CLIN NUTR, V78, P965, DOI 10.1093/ajcn/78.5.96; Liu SM, 2004, DIABETES CARE, V27, P2993, DOI 10.2337/diacare.27.12.299; Liu SM, 2003, AM J CLIN NUTR, V78, P920, DOI 10.1093/ajcn/78.5.92; Meyer KA, 2000, AM J CLIN NUTR, V71, P92; Montonen J, 2005, EUR J CLIN NUTR, V59, P441, DOI 10.1038/sj.ejcn.160209; Muraki I, 2013, BMJ-BRIT MED J, V347, DOI 10.1136/bmj.f500; Mursu J, 2014, AM J CLIN NUTR, V99, P328, DOI 10.3945/ajcn.113.06964; NATHAN DM, 1993, NEW ENGL J MED, V328, P1676, DOI 10.1056/NEJM19930610328230; Pereira MA, 2004, ARCH INTERN MED, V164, P370, DOI 10.1001/archinte.164.4.37; Roza JM, 2007, ALTERN THER HEALTH M, V13, P4; Sterne JAC, 2001, BMJ-BRIT MED J, V323, P101, DOI 10.1136/bmj.323.7304.10; Villegas R, 2008, J NUTR, V138, P574, DOI 10.1093/jn/138.3.57; Waterman C, 2015, MOL NUTR FOOD RES, V59, P1013, DOI 10.1002/mnfr.20140067",35,1,1,1,14,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1743.0,1749,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_267,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400018,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003615702479338843,1.2907248384742419e-23,0.018487124720042283,0.06303109230017906,0.018487124720042283

In recent decades, cognitive psychology and neuropsychology have made considerable advances in description of these processes and how they can be disrupted as a result of an injury to the nervous system central. However, it is clear that our adaptation to the environment is not limited to perceiving, reading, and speaking. A fundamental aspect of mental life is represented by the need to continuously modulate the use of these cognitive resources to contingent needs according to our goals and goals. It is this type of problem that refers to the expression executive functions (EFs). During developmental age Efs change consistently and since age of 8 years many Efs are similar to adults.","[Maltese, Agata] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy; [Cerroni, Francesco;

The attempt to associate specific regions of the central nervous system (CNS) with specific sensory functions, motor and cognitive skills is one of the most recurring themes in the history of neuroscience. The concept of cerebral localization of mental activities started from the formulations of beginning phrenologists in Nineteenth century, passing through the holistic conceptions and antilocalization that marked some periods of the Twentieth century, until the beginning of the new millennium, characterized by the enormous popularity of the techniques of functional neuroimaging and the success of research programs aiming to create a real functional cartography of the human cerebral cortex.","[Maltese, Agata] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy;

Suffering from anxiety disorders, such as specific phobia, agoraphobia, social anxiety or panic disorder, represents a strong predictor for the development of other psychiatric disorders consequential.

This pilot study aims at the evaluation of the efficacy of a standardized protocol based on Functional theory for GD. Functional Therapy (FT) is an integrated body-mind therapy. Methods: Twenty-eight pathological gamblers completed the FT protocol consisted in 16 sessions, two times a week for a total duration of two months, in an individual setting. No one of the patients was taking any psychopharmacological therapy. Psychological assessment both at baseline (T0) and at the end of the treament (T1) includes the South Oaks Gambling Screen, the PG-Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (PG-YBOCS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Beck Depression Inventory II version (BDI-II), the Barrat Impulsiveness Scale 11th version (BIS-11) and the Measurement of Psychological Stress (MSP). Results: a significant reduction of GD (gambling frequency, duration, money inserted, and expenditure) in pathological gamblers was revealed together with a significant reduction of depression, anxiety, impulsivity and perceived stress. Conclusions: the structured FT program for GD highlights a strong improvement in gambling behavior, in reducing impulsivity, depression, anxiety and perceived stress, thus obtaining a good compliance and a few dropout.","[Maniaci, Giuseppe; La Cascia, Caterina; Ferraro, Laura; Sideli, Lucia; Seminerio, Fabio; Scaglione, Alessandra; La Barbera, Daniele] Univ Palermo, Dept Expt Biomed & Clin Neurosci, Palermo, Italy; [Picone, Francesca] ASP Palermo, Dept Pathol Addict, Palermo, Italy; [Cannizzaro, Carla] Giuseppe DAlessandro Univ Palermo, Dept Sci Hlth Promot & Mother & Child Care, Palermo, Italy","Maniaci, G (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Expt Biomed & Clin Neurosci, Palermo, Italy.",giuseppemaniaci@icloud.com,"Ferraro, Laura/AAG-3724-2020; La Cascia, Caterina/U-7743-2017; La Barbera, Daniele/AAX-5591-2020","Ferraro, Laura/0000-0002-1205-2356; La Cascia, Caterina/0000-0002-2078-0214; La Barbera, Daniele/0000-0002-9506-4546",,,"Achab S, 2011, CURR PHARM DESIGN, V17, P1389, DOI 10.2174/13816121179615077; American Psychiatric Association American Psychiatric Association, 2013, DIAGNOSTIC STAT MANU, V5t; Beck A.T., 1996, BECK DEPRESSION INV; BERGER BG, 1988, RES Q EXERCISE SPORT, V59, P148, DOI 10.1080/02701367.1988.1060549; Cavallaro A, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P903, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_10; Chambless DL, 2001, ANNU REV PSYCHOL, V52, P685, DOI 10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.68; Cowlishaw S, 2012, COCHRANE DB SYST REV, DOI 10.1002/14651858.CD008937.pub; Di Nuovo S, 2000, MISURARE STRESS LIN; Dunn K., 2012, J GAMBL STUD, V12, P; Gambling Serpelloni G., 2013, GIOCO AZZARDO PROBL; Hodgins DC, 2004, PSYCHOL ADDICT BEHAV, V18, P293, DOI 10.1037/0893-164X.18.3.29; Ledgerwood DM, 2006, CLIN PSYCHOL REV, V26, P216, DOI 10.1016/j.cpr.2005.11.00; Leeman RF, 2012, PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY, V219, P469, DOI 10.1007/s00213-011-2550-; LESIEUR HR, 1987, AM J PSYCHIAT, V144, P118; Lupi M, 2014, BIOMED RES INT, V2014, DOI 10.1155/2014/53730; Lushene, MANUAL STATE TRAIT ; Malathi A., 1999, Indian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology, V43, P21; Maniaci G, 2018, J GAMBL STUD, V34, P147, DOI 10.1007/s10899-017-9685-; Maniaci G, 2017, PSYCHIAT RES, V257, P540, DOI 10.1016/j.psychres.2017.08.00; Maniaci G, 2017, J GAMBL STUD, V33, P633, DOI 10.1007/s10899-016-9636-; Maniaci G, 2015, INT J MENT HEALTH AD, V13, P728, DOI 10.1007/s11469-015-9550-; Murugesan R., 2000, Indian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology, V44, P20; Netz Y, 2003, J PSYCHOL, V137, P405, DOI 10.1080/0022398030960062; Nower L, 2013, ADDICTION, V108, P789, DOI 10.1111/add.1201; Pallanti S, 2005, J GAMBL STUD, V2; Perciavalle V, 2017, NEUROL SCI, V38, P451, DOI 10.1007/s10072-016-2790-; Perrella R, 2017, MEDITERR J CLIN PSYC, V5, DOI 10.6092/2282-1619/2017.5.166; Petry NM, 2014, J GAMBL STUD, V30, P493, DOI 10.1007/s10899-013-9370-; Plescia F, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P81; Raju P S, 1997, J Altern Complement Med, V3, P291, DOI 10.1089/acm.1997.3.29; Rash CJ, 2014, PSYCHOL RES BEHAV MA, V7, P285, DOI 10.2147/PRBM.S4088; Rispoli L, 2008, BASIC EXPERIENCE DE; Rispoli L., 2016, CORPO PSICOTERAPIA ; Rosenberg O, 2013, PSYCHIAT RES, V206, P111, DOI 10.1016/j.psychres.2012.09.04; Rosenthal R J, 1994, J Gambl Stud, V10, P21, DOI 10.1007/BF0210977; Smith DP, 2015, BEHAV RES THER, V69, P100, DOI 10.1016/j.brat.2015.04.00; Stinchfield R, 2002, ADDICT BEHAV, V27, P1, DOI 10.1016/S0306-4603(00)00158-; Telles S, 1993, Indian J Med Sci, V47, P23; Toneatto T, 2008, AM J ADDICTION, V17, P298, DOI 10.1080/1055049080213883; Viets VCL, 1997, CLIN PSYCHOL REV, V17, P689, DOI 10.1016/S0272-7358(97)00031-",40,5,5,0,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1447.0,1452,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_220,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700042,,,,,2022-07-14,0.004132231404958678,1.14972429273498e-11,0.05839320280166911,0.07095889808454958,0.05839320280166911
J,"Merdin, A1",,,,"Merdin, Alparslan",,,SUGGESTION OF NEW FORMULAE TO BE USED IN DISTINGUISHING BETA THALASEMIA TRAIT FROM IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Thalasemia trait; iron deficiency anemia; discrimination index,DIFFERENTIATION; INDEXES,"Introduction: Clinical findings of thalasemia trait is similar with iron deficiency anemia. It is important to discriminate both from each other. Because treatment approaches are different for the each entities. But, it is not always possible to reach enough laboratory sufficiency for discriminating the two entities everywhere. Some pratical and easy formulae could help for the discrimination in such insufficient technical possibilities. Materials and method: 40 patients included in the study. The formula (RDW(Red blood cell distribution width) X RBC(Red blood cell count) X HGB(Hemoglobin))/MCV(Mean corpuscular volume) was evaluated for the discrimination of the two entities. The formula log(10) (MCH(Mean corpuscular hemoglobin) X MCHC(Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) X RDW / RBC) was also evaluated for the differentiation of these two entities. The latter formula was identified as Alparslan index''. These formulae were compared with the well known indices such as Mentzer index. Youden Index was calculated for each index for comparing the reliability and validity of the indices. Results: The study showed no difference between the compared indices according to the sensitivity. Youden Index were found 94,73 for the Alparslan Index and 89,96 for the Mentzer Index. Discussion: There are many formulae and indices to help have an opinion for the discrimination of beta thalasemia trait from IDA(Iron deficiency anemia). Simply calculable valid formulae could be more commonly and easily used according to the complex calculation formulae. RDWI(Red Blood Cell Distribution Width Index) was found to provide more reliability than Mentzer Index in the study. In the study, Alparslan Index and RDWI were also found to provide same reliability according to Youden Index.","[Merdin, Alparslan] Univ Hlth Sci Ankara, Dr Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Oncol Training & Res Hos, Hematol Clin, Ankara, Turkey; [Merdin, Alparslan] Univ Hlth Sci Ankara, Dr Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Oncol Training & Res Hos, Bone Marrow Transplantat Unit, Ankara, Turkey","Merdin, A (corresponding author), Zerdalilik Mahallesi, Muratpasa Antalya, Turkey.",Alparslanmerdin@yahoo.com,,,,,"Demir A, 2002, PEDIATR INT, V44, P612, DOI 10.1046/j.1442-200X.2002.01636.; GREEN R, 1989, BLOOD CELLS, V15, P48; Jayabose S, 1999, J PEDIAT HEMATOL ONC, V21, P31; MENTZER WC, 1973, LANCET, V1, P88; Ntaios G, 2007, ANN HEMATOL, V86, P487, DOI 10.1007/s00277-007-0302-; Sirdah M, 2008, INT J LAB HEMATOL, V30, P324, DOI 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2007.00966.; SRIVASTAVA PC, 1973, LANCET, V2, P15; Vehapoglu A, 2014, ANEMIA, V2014, DOI 10.1155/2014/57673; YOUDEN WJ, 1950, CANCER-AM CANCER SOC, V3, P32, DOI 10.1002/1097-0142(1950)3:1<32::AID-CNCR2820030106>3.0.CO;2-",9,2,2,1,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,393.0,395,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_62,,3,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400016,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0010330578512396695,1.85308020870256e-08,0.00844229946574291,0.12781746398531685,0.00844229946574291

During this time, every woman must be nourished in such a way as to maintain herself in good health and at the same time allovt , the fetal tissues to form and develop in the best way. Proper nutrition is one of the fundamental prerequisites for the normal evolution of both pregnancy and fetal growth: the quantity and quality of food and drinks must be scrupulously controlled. Contrariwise, it is important to avoid the excess calories and macronutrients. In filet, during pregnancy, it may be just as harmful as their shortage, e.specially in overweight and obese women, jar which the risk of miscarriage, gestational diabetes, fetal growth disorders and preeclampsia increases. The pasta constitutes the foundation of the Mediterranean diet food. The dough can be seen, therefore, so it represents an excellent ally of the diet from a nutritional point of view. The nutritional values of the pasta change depending on the type, based on the fact that the dough is traditional or integral semolina. It also contains vitamin B and has an abundance of minerals, among which potassium. The pasta is an easily digestible food, ensuring energy ready to use (such as all carbohydrates); moreover, it possesses a great satiating power. In case of overweight, however, it is possible to reduce the number of carbohydrates in the diet, taking care not to make them ever miss. In conclusion, the consumption of pasta is very important during pregnancy: a diet without carbohydrates can be dangerous for all physiological pathways.","[Messina, Antonietta; Monda, Vincenzo; Monda, Marcellino] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Expt Med, Naples, Italy;

According to different treatment methods, they are divided into observation group and control group, respectively 800 cases, 400 cases. Injury patients in observation group were treated with traditional Chinese massage manipulation, while injury patients in control group received conventional western way of treatment. Used drugs are Voltaren, to be administered in external application. Half a month after treatment, ankle injury symptoms and recovery of ankle function before and after treatment were compared and effect evaluation was done from such dimensions as ankle injury pain, joint swelling, joint tenderness, joint dysfunction. The results show that after massage manipulation, ankle symptoms and functional activity index scores of injury patients in observation group are significantly reduced. Compared with the situation before treatment, improved difference significantly P<0.05, statistically significant. In comparison of indexes of the two groups, ankle junction recovery of observation group patients is obviously better than that of control group patients, differences between the two groups P <0.05, with statistically significant differences. Therefore, the results of this study Ally confirm that treatment of Gymnasts' ankle sprain and contusion with massage manipulation can effectively improve patients' ankle function, and help patients relieve pain, with good therapeutic effect and high clinical value.","[Mi, Zhan] Changan Univ, Dept Phys Educ, Xian 710064, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Mi, Z (corresponding author), Changan Univ, Dept Phys Educ, Xian 710064, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",345035663@qq.com,,,,,"Banjar A, 2017, TURK J MED SCI, V47, P211, DOI 10.3906/sag-1510-10; Bich GA, 2017, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V24, P851, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2016.05.01; Bo Chen, 2012, CHINESE J TRADITIONA, V; Bo Chen, 2012, SHANGHAI J TRADITION, V12, P5; Dilci A, 2017, TURK J MED SCI, V47, P1757, DOI 10.3906/sag-1705-10; Feiyue Li, 2014, CHINESE J TRADITIONA, V1; Fu HL, 2017, WATER-SUI, V9, DOI 10.3390/w911084; Ge SB, 2017, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V24, P1355, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2016.09.01; Jianbang Tang, 2011, J GUANGZHOU U TRADIT, V17, P23; Kumar R, 2016, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V23, P243, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2015.03.00; Li S, 2013, ACTA OCEANOL SIN, V32, P8, DOI 10.1007/s13131-013-0326-; Pinhui Xie, 2011, JIANGXI J TRADITIONA, V21, P6; Shi Yanpeng, 2014, J OPT, V16, P; Valiee S, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P102; Xiangyang Zhai, 2011, J CHINESE MED, V8, P37; Yang AM, 2017, J ALLOY COMPD, V695, P915, DOI 10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.10.18; Yingzhi Li, 2014, J LIAONING U TRADITI, V23, P8; Zhongsheng Gou, 2013, CHINESE MED HERALD, V8, P208",18,0,0,1,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,3.0,,1589.0,1592,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3s_247,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GP7NG,WOS:000441088400023,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001859504132231405,3.8554944463586776e-05,0.010585115276515716,0.09918134407114827,0.008198730245191103

The purpose of the present study was to validate the Arabic-Tunisian version of the French CSAI-2R questionnaire and to evaluate its validity and reliability. Materials and methods: Out of an initial list of 490 subjects, participants of the present validation study were 304 Tunisian football players (81 males [26.6%]; mean age 21.58 years (SD = 2.40 years, range 16-31) of different levels (international level: 34 [11.2%]; national level: 238 [78.3%]; regional level: 32 [10.5%]) that volunteered to participate in the study. Data were collected and analyzed in terms of reliability and validity using correlations, reliability, parallel analysis and exploratory factor analysis. Results: The 2-factor solution accounted for 48%, 47% and 56% of variance for the Direction, Frequency, and Intensity scales, respectively. The 3-factor solution accounted for 60%, 57% and 64% of variance for the Direction, Frequency, and Intensity scales, respectively. Although the 3-factor solution explained an additional, substantial proportion of variance with respect to the 2-factor solution, the factor structure did not replicate well across scales. Conversely, in 2-factor solution, if items 1, 2, 15, and 16 were excluded, the pattern of loadings was exactly the same for all scales. Hence, we concluded that the 2-factor solution should be retained, as it provided a measurement model for the Arabic-Tunisian CSAI-2R items that was constant across scales. Conclusion: The Arabic-Tunisian version of the French CSAI-2R in its original version has failed to demonstrate robust and sound psychometric properties. Its reduced version represents a first attempt that can be henceforth used in the Arab world, even if further investigations should enable to improve its psychometric properties.","[Mnedla, Sofiene] Mannouba Univ, Dept Educ Sci, Higher Inst Sport & Phys Educ Ksar Said, Manouba, Tunisia; [Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi] Univ Genoa, Dept Hlth Sci DISSAL, Sch Publ Hlth, I-16132 Genoa, Italy; [Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi] Univ Genoa, IRCCS San Martino IST, Dept Neurosci DINOGMI, Sect Psychiat, Largo Rosanna Benzi 10, I-16132 Genoa, Italy; [Chiorri, Carlo] Univ Genoa, Dept Educ Sci, Genoa, Italy; [Elloumi, Ali] Univ Paris 05, Lab Tech & Enjeux Corps, Paris, France; [Briki, Walid] Qatar Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Sport Sci Program, Doha, Qatar","Mnedla, S (corresponding author), Mannouba Univ, Dept Educ Sci, Higher Inst Sport & Phys Educ Ksar Said, Manouba, Tunisia.;Mnedla, S (corresponding author), Tunis Univ, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Educ Sci, Tunis, Tunisia.",,"Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi/G-1672-2011","Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi/0000-0001-8409-868X; Briki, Walid/0000-0002-6298-811X",,,"Asparouhov T, 2009, STRUCT EQU MODELING, V16, P397, DOI 10.1080/1070551090300820; Benjamini Y, 2000, J EDUC BEHAV STAT, V25, P60, DOI 10.3102/1076998602500106; BUJA A, 1992, MULTIVAR BEHAV RES, V27, P509, DOI 10.1207/s15327906mbr2704_; Gaudreau P, 2002, PSYCHOL SPORT EXERC, V3, P1, DOI 10.1016/S1469-0292(01)00017-; Genz A., 2016, PACKAGE MVTNOR; Hambleton RK., 2009, ADAPTING ED PSYCHO; HORN JL, 1965, PSYCHOMETRIKA, V30, P179, DOI 10.1007/BF0228944; JONES G, 1992, PERCEPT MOTOR SKILL, V74, P467, DOI 10.2466/PMS.74.2.467-47; Martens R., 1990, COMPETITIVE ANXIETY, P12; Martinent G, 2010, PSYCHOL SPORT EXERC, V11, P51, DOI 10.1016/j.psychsport.2009.05.00; MORRIS LW, 1981, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V73, P541, DOI 10.1037/0022-0663.73.4.54; Muthen B., 1998, MPLUS USERS GUID; Nunnally J, 1994, PSYCHOMETRIC THEOR; SWAIN A, 1993, J SPORT SCI, V11, P533, DOI 10.1080/0264041930873002; VALLERAND RJ, 1989, CAN PSYCHOL, V30, P662, DOI 10.1037/h007985; Woodman T, 2005, J SPORT EXERCISE PSY, V27, P382, DOI 10.1123/jsep.27.3.38; Woodman T, 2003, J SPORT SCI, V21, P443, DOI 10.1080/026404103100010180; Woodman T., 2001, HDB SPORT PSYCHOL, V2nd, P29",18,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,377.0,382,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_59,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400013,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001859504132231405,2.5923121446639495e-11,0.0035094935871218167,0.10348182119453085,0.0035094935871218167

It is known that phylogenetic history, size and ecology can all promote the evolution of morphological variation; however, some methods have been recently developed to analyze these aspects for particular body structures. Spotted whip snake Hemorrhois ravergieri appears to have the widest distribution of the Hemorrhois snake genus, especially in Iran. Morphological difference resulting from habitat can occur in several populations of H. ravergieri. Some studies have studied the relation between morphology and habitat use, revealing that motion is the main facilitator of this evolutionary relationship. Now, we consider intraspecific ecomorphological in three habitat types. Geometric morphometric analyses can provide a more detailed image of head shape in three directions (dorsal, lateral and ventral) on three types of habitat: north-west of Iran, north-east of Iran and central Zagros of Iran. Adult specimens were selected and characteristics of head were analyzed, along with body and head size for understanding the proximate mechanisms, which might be involved. The morphological variation between H. ravergieri indicated that variation in size and head dimensions between species and sexes are highly significant in habitat. Males and females differed in head characters and body size; especially, males were found to exhibit a disproportionate increase in head size and dimensions. H. ravergieri from north-east and central Zagros are smaller, than those living in north-west are. The results revealed that considering the previous findings on the populations, the morphological differences were probably not caused by competition between the populations; instead, these traits could be attributed to the natural selection.","[Moshtaghie, Minoo] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Environm & Energy, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Kaboli, Mohammad] Univ Tehran, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Environm, Tehran, Iran; [Salehi, Mansour] Isfahan Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Dept Genet & Mol Biol, Esfahan, Iran","Kaboli, M (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Environm, Tehran, Iran.",mkaboli@ut.ac.ir,,,,,"Adams DC, 2004, ITAL J ZOOL, V71, P5, DOI 10.1080/1125000040935654; Adams DC, 2013, HYSTRIX, V24, P7, DOI 10.4404/hystrix-24.1-628; ANDREWS RM, 1994, COPEIA, P613, DOI 10.2307/144717; Barros FC, 2011, J EVOLUTION BIOL, V24, P2423, DOI 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2011.02372.; Bookstein, BIOMETRICS 1978 INT, P15; Brown JH, 2000, SFI S SCI C, P; Bruner E, 2005, ACTA ZOOL-STOCKHOLM, V86, P245, DOI 10.1111/j.1463-6395.2005.00206.; Cardini A, 2009, ZOOL J LINN SOC-LOND, V157, P197, DOI 10.1111/j.1096-3642.2009.00508.; CARPENTER GC, 1995, HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS, NO 9, 1995, P8; Claude J, 2003, BIOL J LINN SOC, V79, P485, DOI 10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00198.; Collar DC, 2011, EVOLUTION, V65, P2664, DOI 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01335.; COOPER WE, 1989, AM NAT, V133, P729, DOI 10.1086/28494; DRYDEN IL, 1998, STAT SHAPE ANAL VOL; Fathnia B, 2011, IRANIAN J ANIMAL BIO, V; Ghazikhanloo A, 2013, J ANIMAL ENV, V4, P5; Goodman RM, 2013, INTEGR ZOOL, V8, P184, DOI 10.1111/1749-4877.1204; Gvozdik L, 2003, J ZOOL, V259, P7, DOI 10.1017/S095283690200330; Herrel A, 2001, J EXP ZOOL, V290, P101, DOI 10.1002/jez.103; Herrel A, 2007, INTEGR COMP BIOL, V47, P107, DOI 10.1093/icb/icm01; Husak JF, 2006, COPEIA, P301, DOI 10.1643/0045-8511(2006)6[301:BPPDIM]2.0.CO;; Huyghe K, 2009, BIOL J LINN SOC, V96, P13, DOI 10.1111/j.1095-8312.2008.01103.; Kaliontzopoulou A, 2008, BIOL J LINN SOC, V93, P11; Kaliontzopoulou A, 2007, J MORPHOL, V268, P152, DOI 10.1002/jmor.1049; Kikukawa Nobuto, 2012, Current Herpetology, V31, P97, DOI 10.5358/hsj.31.9; Klingenberg CP, 2012, J EVOLUTION BIOL, V25, P115, DOI 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2011.02410.; Klingenberg CP, 1998, EVOLUTION, V52, P1363, DOI 10.1111/j.1558-5646.1998.tb02018.; Pyron RA, 2013, BMC EVOL BIOL, V13, DOI 10.1186/1471-2148-13-9; Rice WR, 2001, J EVOLUTION BIOL, V14, P685, DOI 10.1046/j.1420-9101.2001.00319.; Rohlf F.

It is important to understand which interventions focused on the reduction of weight gained during pregnancy are the safest, and the most effective. Methods: A pilot study was carried out in a Hospital setting. Twenty-nine women were involved in the study. A healthy lifestyle promotion program for postpartum women including, visual materials of an exercise program, and physical activity and healthy diet recommendations after delivery, was designed. Women after 2 days after delivery were invited to participate in the study by following recommendations on lifestyle. After two and six month's postpartum, women were asked to come back to the Obstetrics Department for individual control (health variables), lifestyle (diet and exercise) and anthropometric measurements (body composition). Data analysis consisted of the qualitative analysis regarding the feasibility of the program, and on the quantitative analysis regarding the changes of the outcome variables from 2 to 6 months postpartum. Results: The pilot study was feasible and most of the participants were satisfied with it. The materials were built by health and exercise professionals, and were easily put in practice. The setting was appropriate, and the intervention was combined with the usual care of postpartum women in a hospital setting, supervised by a midwife. The pilot intervention resulted in positive changes in body composition (i.e., 71.1 +/- 10.8 to 62.6 +/- 10.1 kg; and significant reduction of most girths and skin folds' measurements), and physical activity level of women (12.1 +/- 1.6 to 23.5 +/- 2.5 metabolic equivalent) within 6 months after delivery. Discussion: This pilot study supports the research hypothesis that a healthy lifestyle promotion program may positively affect the changes in the body composition and physical activity level of women after childbirth. A protocol study for a randomised control study will be developed in first place.","[Pajaujiene, Simona] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Dept Coaching Sci, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Dabasinskiene, Laura] Vilnius Univ Hosp Santaros Clin, Obstet Dept, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Santos-Rocha, Rita] Polytech Inst Santarem, Sport Sci Sch Rio Maior, Santarem, Portugal; [Santos-Rocha, Rita] Univ Lisbon, Fac Human Kinet, Interdisciplinary Ctr Study Human Performance, Lisbon, Portugal","Santos-Rocha, R (corresponding author), Escola Super Desporto Rio Maior, Av Dr Mario Soares 110, P-2040413 Rio Maior, Portugal.",ritasantosrocha@esdrm.ipsantarem.pt,"Santos-Rocha, Rita/AAF-3774-2020; Santos-Rocha, Rita A/L-4317-2014","Santos-Rocha, Rita/0000-0001-7188-8383; Santos-Rocha, Rita A/0000-0001-7188-8383",,,"Adegboye ARA, 2013, COCHRANE DB SYST REV, DOI 10.1002/14651858.CD005627.pub; American College of Sports Medicine, 2017, ACSMS GUIDELINES EX; Blum JW, 2004, MATERN CHILD HEALT J, V8, P163, DOI 10.1023/B:MACI.0000037649.24025.2; Chasan-Taber L, 2004, MED SCI SPORT EXER, V36, P1750, DOI 10.1249/01.MSS.0000142303.49306.0; Chasan-Taber L, 2011, MED SCI SPORT EXER, V43, P195, DOI 10.1249/MSS.0b013e318202a02; Choi SK, 2011, REPROD BIOL ENDOCRIN, V9, DOI 10.1186/1477-7827-9-; Comm Obstet Practice, 2015, OBSTET GYNECOL, V126, pe135, DOI 10.1097/AOG.000000000000121; Cramp AG, 2010, MATERN CHILD HLTH J, V14, P343, DOI 10.1007/s10995-009-0462-; EuropeActive, 2016, EUROPEACTIVE STAND ; Fell DB, 2009, MATERN CHILD HLTH J, V13, P597, DOI 10.1007/s10995-008-0404-; Godin G., 1997, MED SCI SPORT EXER, V29, pS36, DOI DOI 10.1097/00005768-199706001-0000; Jones G, 2017, PILOT FEASIBILITY ST, V4, P; Kernot J, 2013, BMC PUBLIC HEALTH, V13, DOI 10.1186/1471-2458-13-51; Kinnunen TI, 2007, NUTR J, V6, DOI 10.1186/1475-2891-6-2; Leddy Meaghan A, 2008, Rev Obstet Gynecol, V1, P17; Lietuvos statistikos departamentas, 2015, LIET GYV SVEIK 201; Medairos R, 2016, J PHYS ACT HEALTH, V6, P; Mottola MF, 2013, NUTR REV, V71, pS31, DOI 10.1111/nure.1206; Myatt L., 2010, MATERNAL FETAL NUT; Norton K, 2004, ANTHROPOMETRICA TXB, P2; Paoli A, 2015, CLIN PHYSIOL FUNCT I, V35, P1, DOI 10.1111/cpf.1213; Paoli A, 2012, AM J CARDIOL, V109, P305, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2011.10.01; Ruager-Martin R, 2010, EARLY HUM DEV, V86, P715, DOI 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2010.08.00; Saligheh M, 2016, BMC PREGNANCY CHILDB, V16, DOI 10.1186/s12884-016-0908-; Schmitt NM, 2007, INT J OBESITY, V31, P1642, DOI 10.1038/sj.ijo.080365; Siri W.E., 1961, TECHNIQUES MEASURING, P22; Tenenbaum-Gavish K, 2013, FETAL DIAGN THER, V34, P1, DOI 10.1159/00035017; The American College of Nurse-Midwives, 2014, J MIDWIFERY WOM HEAL, V59, P47; Torris C, 2013, BREASTFEED MED, V8, P8, DOI 10.1089/bfm.2012.004; Tripette J, 2014, MED SCI SPORT EXER, V46, P472, DOI 10.1249/MSS.000000000000013; Walker LO, 2007, JOGNN-J OBST GYN NEO, V36, P490, DOI 10.1111/J.1552-6909.2007.00179.; WHO, 2014, OB O; WILMORE JH, 1970, AM J CLIN NUTR, V23, P26",33,0,0,0,11,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1365.0,1375,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_209,,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700031,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003409090909090909,2.1861023583513504e-08,0.01636697139491075,0.10518880738929638,0.0156293230122512

In this context, performing a regular physical activity promotes a healthy lifestyle, with significant health benefits. The aim of the study was to investigate behaviors that increase the risk of obesity and the determinants that encourage physical activity among adolescents. Materials and methods: The HBSC (Health Behavior in School-aged Children) questionnaire was administered to students in Palermo's private and public schools. For the sampling of public schools the protocol of the HBSC Surveillance System was followed; for the private ones it was opportunistic. Results: Private school students are more likely to exercise more than 3 days per week (OR 1.58) and are more likely to exercise more than 2 times a week (OR 2.08). Obese students in private schools in Palermo are more likely to perform physical activity for less than 3 days a week (OR 3.52) and a higher risk of not having breakfast (OR 10.11) and a snack between main meals (OR 3.82) every day. For all the schools examined, it emerged that obese subjects are more likely not to consume fruit (OR 3.13), to stay more than 6 hours a day in front of PCs and video games (OR 3.24) and more than 2 hours a day in front of TV (OR 3.79). Male students are more likely to perform physical activity for more than 3 days per week (OR 1.48) and intense physical activity at least 2 times per week (OR 1.76) Conclusions: It is necessary to intervene early with training on school and family in order to promote correct and responsible food choices and increase the level of physical activity among students. Therefore prevention interventions must be an integral part of coherent strategies based on tests of agreed effectiveness in order to minimize the risk linked to the development of diseases.","[Provenzano, Sandro; Santangelo, Omar Enzo; Catalano, Rosanna; Marchese, Valentina; Bonanno, Valentina; La Placa, Simona; Firenze, Alberto] Univ Study Palermo, Dept Sci Hlth Promot & Mother & Child Care GD Ale, Palermo, Italy; [La Placa, Simona] Polyclin Univ Hosp P Giaccone, Palermo, Italy; [Cernigliaro, Achille] Reg Hlth Author, Dept Hlth Serv & Epidemiol Observ, Palermo, Sicilian Region, Italy; [Mattina, Francesca] Local Hlth Unit Palermo, Dept Prevent Food Hyg Surveillance & Nutr Prevent, Palermo, Italy","Firenze, A (corresponding author), Dipartimento Sci Promoz Salute & Materno Infantil, Via Vespro 129, I-90127 Palermo, Italy.",alberto.firenze@unipa.it,"Santangelo, Omar Enzo/T-9659-2019; Cernigliaro, Achille/AAP-8092-2020","Santangelo, Omar Enzo/0000-0003-2017-3665; Provenzano, Sandro/0000-0001-7179-7246",,,"Alfermann D, 2000, INT J SPORT PSYCHOL, V31, P4; Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, 2001, MMWR Recomm Rep, V50, P; [Anonymous], 2014, CALCULATE YOUR BM; Bar-on ME, 2001, PEDIATRICS, V107, P423, DOI 10.1542/peds.107.2.42; Boreham C, 2001, J SPORT SCI, V19, P915, DOI 10.1080/02640410131710842; Centers for Disease Control SHAPE America, 2017, PHYS ACTIVIT; Crespo CJ, 2001, ARCH PEDIAT ADOL MED, V155, P360, DOI 10.1001/archpedi.155.3.36; Fox KR, 2000, INT J SPORT PSYCHOL, V31, P22; Friedlander SL, 2003, ARCH PEDIAT ADOL MED, V157, P1206, DOI 10.1001/archpedi.157.12.120; Haines J, 2007, OBESITY, V15, P2748, DOI 10.1038/oby.2007.32; HBSC Italia, 2014, HLTH BEH SCH AG CHI; Mainvil LA, 2009, AM J HEALTH PROMOT, V23, P210, DOI 10.4278/ajhp.06122115; Ministero della Salute Repubblica Italiana, 2012, DOSS ALC GUAD SA; Mond J, 2011, J ADOLESCENT HEALTH, V48, P373, DOI 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.07.02; Nelson MC, 2006, PEDIATRICS, V118, pE1627, DOI 10.1542/peds.2006-092; Pearson N, 2009, PUBLIC HEALTH NUTR, V12, P267, DOI 10.1017/S136898000800258; Provincia autonoma di Bolzano-Alto Adige, 2010, IND SPORT SCO; Santangelo OE, 2018, RIV PSICHIA IN PRESS, V5; Schor EL, 2003, PEDIATRICS, V111, P154; Sjoberg RL, 2005, PEDIATRICS, V116, pE389, DOI 10.1542/peds.2005-017; Sonneville KR, 2009, BMC PEDIATR, V9, DOI 10.1186/1471-2431-9-8; StataCorp, 2015, STAT REL 14 STAT SO; Strauss RS, 2003, ARCH PEDIAT ADOL MED, V157, P746, DOI 10.1001/archpedi.157.8.74; Swallen KC, 2005, PEDIATRICS, V115, P340, DOI 10.1542/peds.2004-067; Troiano RP, 2001, J NUTR, V131, p451S, DOI 10.1093/jn/131.2.451; Vieno A, 2005, EPIDEMIOL PSICHIAT S, V14, P100, DOI 10.1017/S1121189X0000630; Who, 2000, IS BIRDT; World Health Organization, 2004, GLOB STRAT DIE; World Health Organization, 2011, GLOBAL RECOMMENDATI",29,2,2,0,8,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,443.0,448,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_70,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400024,,,,,2022-07-14,0.002995867768595041,1.302119102102506e-08,0.005777055036933499,0.07108604495751727,0.005777055036933499

Various diseases can affect memory function and yield specific memory impairments. One of these conditions, transient global amnesia, is a peculiar type of memory loss with hallmark characteristics. However, the pathophysiological explanation for transient global amnesia remains controversial Methods: Starting with the most significant data from the literature, we describe the most important features needed for diagnosing the three main clinical conditions that could mimic transient global amnesia. Then, we describe a retrospective series of cases of transient global amnesia. Results: Among the cases observed, we focus on a case of transient global amnesia with features that distinguish it from the cases reported in the literature. Conclusion: This paper describes the key features of transient global amnesia, discusses the main differential diagnoses from similar conditions and proposes a pathogenetic interpretation consistent with all of the hallmarks of the disorder (amnesia duration, lack of specific neuroradiological and electroencephalo-graphic correlates or impaired sensitivity or motility, reversibility and benign prognosis of the amnesic episodes, and rare recurrence).","[Rampello, Luigi; Rampello, Liborio; Zappia, Mario] Univ Catania, Neurosci Sect, GF Ingrassia Dept, Via Santa Sofia 78, I-95123 Catania, Italy; [Malaguarnera, Giulia] Univ Catania, Res Ctr, Great Senescence, I-95123 Catania, Italy; [Chisari, Eleonora Margherita] Univ Catania, Dept Educ, I-95123 Catania, Italy; [Arcidiacono, Antonio] Univ Catania, Biometec Dept, Via Santa Sofia 78, I-95123 Catania, Italy","Rampello, L (corresponding author), Univ Catania, Dipartimento GF Ingrassia, Sez Neurosci, Via Santa Sofia 78, I-95123 Catania, Italy.",,"Zappia, Mario/AAB-7800-2019",,University of Catania [21040104],Financial support was provided by the University of Catania (code 21040104),"Bartolomei F, 2004, NEUROLOGY, V63, P858, DOI 10.1212/01.WNL.0000137037.56916.3; Bartsch T, 2007, ANN NEUROL, V62, P475, DOI 10.1002/ana.2118; Bartsch T, 2010, LANCET NEUROL, V9, P205, DOI 10.1016/S1474-4422(09)70344-; Bettermann K, 2006, ARCH NEUROL-CHICAGO, V63, P1336, DOI 10.1001/archneur.63.9.133; Butler CR, 2008, BRAIN, V131, P2243, DOI 10.1093/brain/awn12; Caplan L., 1985, HDB CLIN NEUROLOGY, V1, P20; Cataudella E, 2012, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V28, P24; Di Filippo M, 2007, NEUROLOGY, V69, P493, DOI 10.1212/01.wnl.0000271085.87627.7; Dohring J, 2014, FRONT BEHAV NEUROSCI, V8, DOI 10.3389/fnbeh.2014.0028; FISHER CM, 1964, ACTA NEUROL SCAND, V40, P; GANDOLFO C, 1992, EUR NEUROL, V32, P52, DOI 10.1159/00011678; HODGES JR, 1990, J NEUROL NEUROSUR PS, V53, P834, DOI 10.1136/jnnp.53.10.83; HODGES JR, 1990, BRAIN, V113, P639, DOI 10.1093/brain/113.3.63; Malaguarnera M, 2008, DIGEST DIS SCI, V53, P3018, DOI 10.1007/s10620-008-0238-; Malaguarnera M, 2011, SCAND J GASTROENTERO, V46, P750, DOI 10.3109/00365521.2011.56506; Malaguarnera M, 2011, METAB BRAIN DIS, V26, P281, DOI 10.1007/s11011-011-9260-; Manahan-Vaughan D, 2003, NEUROPHARMACOLOGY, V44, P17, DOI 10.1016/S0028-3908(02)00342-; MERRIAM AE, 1992, PSYCHOSOMATICS, V33, P109, DOI 10.1016/S0033-3182(92)72029-; MILLER JW, 1987, NEUROLOGY, V37, P733, DOI 10.1212/WNL.37.5.73; Quinette P, 2006, BRAIN, V129, P1640, DOI 10.1093/brain/awl10; Rampello L, 2005, J NEUROL, V252, P1045, DOI 10.1007/s00415-005-0811-; Rampello L, 2004, PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY, V173, P73, DOI 10.1007/s00213-003-1698-; Rampello L, 2000, CNS DRUGS, V13, P35, DOI 10.2165/00023210-200013010-0000; Rampello L, 2016, J NEUROL SCI, V369, P354, DOI 10.1016/j.jns.2016.08.04; Ricceri R, 2013, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V29, P9; Schmidtke K, 1998, EUR NEUROL, V40, P9, DOI 10.1159/00000794; Schreiber SJ, 2005, J NEUROL NEUROSUR PS, V76, P509, DOI 10.1136/jnnp.2004.04384; STILLHARD G, 1990, J NEUROL NEUROSUR PS, V53, P339, DOI 10.1136/jnnp.53.4.33; Vuilleumier P, 1996, NEUROLOGY, V46, P1036, DOI 10.1212/WNL.46.4.103; Weon YC, 2008, AM J NEURORADIOL, V29, P1324, DOI 10.3174/ajnr.A110; Winbeck K, 2005, J NEUROL NEUROSUR PS, V76, P438, DOI 10.1136/jnnp.2004.04243; Zelante G, 2012, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V28, P4; Zeman AZJ, 1998, J NEUROL NEUROSUR PS, V64, P435, DOI 10.1136/jnnp.64.4.43; ZORZON M, 1995, STROKE, V26, P1536, DOI 10.1161/01.STR.26.9.153",34,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,685.0,690,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_105,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000010,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003512396694214876,8.997429532752046e-10,0.00680691093182053,0.10543398939124941,0.00680691093182053

The disease continues to expand in parallel with the incorrect lifestyle habits typical of modern society. The cardinal symptoms of peripheral nervous system diseases may be indicative of motor, sensory, autonomic and trophic lesions. Diabetic neuropathy also has significant economic costs to society. The high rate of diabetic neuropathy causes substantial morbidity from recurrent infections of the lower limbs, ulceration and amputation. Electromyographic examination of the distal muscles of the lower extremities may reveal acute and chronic denervation.

Case presentation: Through the enhancement of corporeity and the integration of music, emotions and movement lived in groups, the Biodanza SRT system induces motor, relational and emotional experiences, by stimulating the possible communication and relationship, the emotional self regulation and the autonomy capabilities, healthy lifestyles and behavioral skills that can be spent in everyday life. Conclusion: Biodanza SRT is an important opportunity for the development of functional skills in areas that are most undermined by the autistic disorder: that of communication, social interaction, interests and behavior in general; it represents an innovative and effective strategy that determines the increase of psychological, motor, emotional and relational well-being by improving the Quality of Life (QoL).","[Rosa, Roberta; D'Andria, Antonio; Napolitano, Felicia] Parthenope Univ, Via Medina 40, Naples, Italy","Rosa, R (corresponding author), Parthenope Univ, Via Medina 40, Naples, Italy.",roberta.rosa@uniparthenope.it,,,,,"Ascione A, 2018, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V34, P1261, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_19; Belfiore P, 2018, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V34, P1257, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_19; Di Palma D, 2018, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V34, P1253, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_19; Gallese V, 2016, EMPATIA SEMPRE INCA; Garaudy R, 1985, DANZARE LA VIT; Ghedin E., 2016, J SPECIAL ED INCLUSI, V2, P20; Giannelli M.

Rolando Toro's Biodanza System (SRT) is a therapeutic strategy of human development and growth that integrates movement, music and emotions to induce motor, relational and emotional experiences. Case presentation: By drawing on Neuroscientific research, the authors describe therapeutic aspects and the use of Biodanza SRT in clinical cases of Neurodegenerative Diseases. By involving people on a physical, mental, emotional, and social level, the aim is to create new movement patterns integrating the individual's emotional and motor components, in order to generate adaptive responses aimed at strengthening the self-esteem and self-efficacy of the communication-relational skills. Conclusion: Biodanza SRT represents an innovative and effective strategy that, in short terms, allows for the increase of psychological, general motor, and emotional-relational well-being, and the consequent improvement of Quality of Life (QoL).","[Rosa, Roberta; de Vita, Tiziana; Napolitano, Felicia] Parthenope Univ, Via Medina 40, Naples, Italy","Rosa, R (corresponding author), Parthenope Univ, Via Medina 40, Naples, Italy.",roberta.rosa@uniparthenope.it,,,,,"Ascione A, 2018, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V34, P1261, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_19; Belfiore P, 2018, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V34, P1257, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_19; Di Palma D, 2018, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V34, P1253, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_19; Gallese V, 1996, BRAIN, V119, P593, DOI 10.1093/brain/119.2.59; Ghedin E., 2016, J SPECIAL ED INCLUSI, V2, P20; Kiepe MS, 2012, ART PSYCHOTHER, V39, P404, DOI 10.1016/j.aip.2012.06.00; Orio F, 2016, MINERVA ENDOCRINOL, V41, P50; Palma D. di, 2018, Journal of Physical Education and Sport, V18, P47; Palma D. di, 2017, Sport Science, V10, P3; Palma D. di, 2017, Sport Science, V10, P1; Palma D. di, 2016, Journal of Physical Education and Sport, V16, P78; Palma D. di, 2016, Sport Science, V9, P2; Raiola G, 2017, SPORT SCI, V10, P5; Raiola G., 2016, SPORT SCI, V9, P4; Rizzolatti G, 1996, COGNITIVE BRAIN RES, V3, P131, DOI 10.1016/0926-6410(95)00038-; Rogers C, 2007, RELAZIONE EFFICACE ; Rosa R., OFFICIAL J ITALIAN N, V3; Rosenzweig MR, 1996, BEHAV BRAIN RES, V78, P57, DOI 10.1016/0166-4328(95)00216-; Stueck M., 2012, BIOPSYCHOLOGICAL BAS, P; Tafuri D., 2017, SPORT SCI, V10, P7; Toro Acuna GC, 2013, IBF RETE CIMEB RET; Toro Araneda R, 2012, TEORIA BIODANZA RACC, V; van Praag H, 2000, NAT REV NEUROSCI, V1, P191, DOI 10.1038/3504455",23,0,0,5,12,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,,,,3.0,,1507.0,1511,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3s_230,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GP7NG,WOS:000441088400007,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0022727272727272726,4.895083590044667e-05,0.0020797114128284036,0.08273150720054699,0.002079160572732498

Eugenol has therapeutic effect on tumor, However, the mechanism of the treatment is not clear, the purpose of this study is to evaluate eugenol anti-tumor effect on ER positive precancerous lesions of breast cancer. Material and methods: 40 female SD rats were randomized into 5 groups, 8 in each. The groups were named Blank control group, Model group, Tamoxifen group, The low dose of Eugenol cream group (0.5mg) and The high dose of Eugenol cream group (1mg) respectively. The rats with breast precancerous lesions were induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) combined with estrogen and progesterone injection. Drug interventions by tamoxifen(TAM) ointment and Eugenol cream were also launched during the model formation. The rats were executed after 70d. In MCF-10AT cell lines, we use 180 mu M eugenol to treat the cell lines, then observed 24 hours. And then the correlated indexes are detected by Western-blot and elisa. Results: 1mg eugenol significantly delayed the pathology process of rat breast tissue models in precancerous lesions of breast cancer, meanwhile, 1mg eugenol reduced the level of serum estradiol(E2) and the reduce rate was 36%, increased progesterone(P) and the increase rate was 26%, in addition, the protein levels of ER alpha, GPER, p-AKT, GSK3-alpha, GSK3-beta, p70s6k were decreased in the rat models and the decreased rates were respectively 31%, 53%, 57%, 58%, 56%, 93%, as well as MCF-10AT cell lines were treated with 180 mu M eugenol, the decreased rates were respectively 35%, 60%, 63%, 57%, 42%, 68% (P < 0.01). However, in rat models the expressions of PTEN and ER beta protein were increased and the increase rates were 76%, 58% (P < 0.05), in MCF-10AT cell lines the increase rates of the expressions of PTEN and ER beta protein were 46%, 177%.

Furthermore, since it is known that comprehensive warm up program helps in prevention injuries, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a comprehensive warm-up program (F-MARC The 11+) on performance and injuries in young basketball players. While knowing the specifics and possible injuries of basketball game, the prevention of injuries must be considered as an important issue. Methods: Twenty children (mean +/- SD: age 10,7 +/- 0,3 yr; height 149,20 +/- 7.51, weight 47,61 +/- 12,30 kg, percentage of body fat: 14,44 +/- 7,68 %) were recruited from two local basketball clubs to participate in this study. Players were randomly selected and assigned to either group: experimental (Exp. n = 10) or a control (Con. n = 10), respectively. They were trained 3 days per week (2,1 +/- 0,6 years of experience), for 10 weeks in a row. The experimental group followed the F-MARC 11+ program for 20 minutes during warm up phase in each training season for ten weeks while control group performed their regular warm up routine. Both groups performed vertical jumps and pro agility tests at the beginning and at the end of the tenth-week training sessions. Moreover, nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed to compare the pre and post test scores. Results: The agility pre-test result was found 6,358 +/- 0, 27 seconds and post-test was found 6,121 +/- 0, 34 seconds. A significant difference was found between agility test values (p<0,05) Discussion: Comprehensive warm-up program leads to a significant change in agility in the present study. Therefore, this is a desirable result since basketball is characterized by many quick movements such as sudden speed-ups, stops and turns. Eventually, previous studies indicated that the FIFA 11+ program resulted to be an important way to warm up properly before training sessions. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study we may conclude that The F-MARC 11+ comprehensive warm-up is an appropriate and effective tool for improving basketball-specific performance such as agility in young basketball players.","[Sahin, Nese] Ankara Univ, Fac Sport Sci, Ankara, Turkey; [Gurses, Veli Volkan; Baydil, Bilgehan; Akgul, Mustafa Sakir] Kastamonu Univ, Sch Phys Educ & Sport, Kastamonu, Turkey; [Feka, Kaltrina] Univ Palermo, PhD Program Hlth Promot & Cognit Sci, Sport & Exercise Sci Res Unit, Palermo, Italy; [Iovane, Angelo; Messina, Giuseppe] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Sport & Exercise Sci Res Unit, Palermo, Italy","Messina, G (corresponding author), Via Giovanni Pascoli 6, I-90144 Palermo, Italy.",giuseppe.messina17@unipa.it,"AKGÜL, Mustafa Şakir/AAT-8696-2020; Messina, Giuseppe/N-7298-2019","AKGÜL, Mustafa Şakir/0000-0002-9696-6541; Messina, Giuseppe/0000-0003-2774-4950; Feka, Kaltrina/0000-0003-1293-7995",,,"Adirim TA, 2006, CURR PAEDIAT, V16, P205, DOI DOI 10.1016/j.cupe.2006.03.00; Agel J, 2007, J ATHL TRAINING, V42, P20; Alentorn-Geli E, 2009, KNEE SURG SPORT TR A, V17, P705, DOI 10.1007/s00167-009-0813-; Bahr R, 2005, BRIT J SPORT MED, V39, P324, DOI 10.1136/bjsm.2005.01834; Battaglia G, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P1589, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_13; Bianco A, 2014, CANCER MED-US, V3, P385, DOI 10.1002/cam4.19; Brito J, 2010, ISOKINET EXERC SCI, V18, P211, DOI 10.3233/IES-2010-038; Chimera NJ, 2004, J ATHL TRAINING, V39, P2; Condello G, 2016, INT J SPORT PHYSIOL, V11, P96, DOI 10.1123/ijspp.2014-045; Cowley HR, 2006, J ATHL TRAINING, V41, P6; Dick R, 2007, J ATHL TRAINING, V42, P19; Enoksen E, 2009, J SPORT SCI, V27, P77, DOI 10.1080/0264041080244872; Neto MG, 2017, CLIN REHABIL, V31, P651, DOI 10.1177/026921551667590; Kilding AE, 2008, J SPORT SCI MED, V7, P32; Krosshaug T, 2007, AM J SPORT MED, V35, P359, DOI 10.1177/036354650629389; Lockie RG, 2016, SPORTS, V4, DOI 10.3390/sports403004; Longo UG, 2012, AM J SPORT MED, V40, P996, DOI 10.1177/036354651243876; Meeuwisse WH, 2003, AM J SPORT MED, V31, P379, DOI 10.1177/0363546503031003090; Pasanen K, 2009, BRIT J SPORT MED, V43, P1073, DOI 10.1136/bjsm.2009.06174; Patti A, 2016, J PHYS THER SCI, V28, P72, DOI 10.1589/jpts.28.7; Sahin N, 2015, J PHYS THER SCI, V27, P437, DOI 10.1589/jpts.27.43; Schulz KF, 2010, J CLIN EPIDEMIOL, V63, P834, DOI [10.1016/j.jclinepi.2010.02.005, 10.4103/0976-500X.72352, 10.1016/j.ijsu.2011.09.004, 10.1186/1741-7015-8-18; Steffen K, 2013, BRIT J SPORT MED, V47, P480, DOI 10.1136/bjsports-2012-09188; Vanderlei Franciele Marques, 2013, Int Arch Med, V6, P5, DOI 10.1186/1755-7682-6-",24,1,1,2,12,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,703.0,707,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_108,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000013,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0024793388429752063,1.3856468475869627e-11,0.007384205948576642,0.09225109834081444,0.0072675878260307575

Efforts on improving treatment modalities and survival is still the most hot topic worldwide. One of the key points is finding out a reliable and cost-effective marker that can predict prognosis. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been shown to be associated with prognosis in various clinical situations. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of NLR at admission and disease severity and 28-day mortality in sepsis and septic shock patients. Materials and methods: Patients over 18 years of age admitted to Medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with the diagnosis of sepsis and septic shock between January 1st ,2010 and January 1st ,2016 were enrolled retrospectively. NLR at ICU admission of each patient was calculated from whole blood test results. Results: A total of 314 patients, 159 men and 155 women, were included in the study. 185 patients (58.9%) were diagnosed as sepsis and 129 patients (41.1%) as septic shock. NLR was significantly higher in the septic shock group (sepsis: 14.7, septic shock: 21.5) (p<0.05). 118 patients (37.6%) survived, and 196 (62.4%) died. While APACHE II scores (survivors: 21; non-survivors: 25) and expected mortality rates (survivors: 38%; non-survivors: 53%) were significantly different between two groups (p<0,05), no significant relationship between NLR and mortality could be detected (p>0.05). Conclusion: In our study, there was no significant relationship between NLR and mortality but, NLR was related to severity of sepsis. We suggest NLR should be used in detecting severity of sepsis besides APACHE and SOFA scores which will increase physicians' awareness during the management of therapy.","[Savran, Yusuf] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Izmir, Turkey; [Mengi, Tugce; Yaka, Erdem] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Neurol, Izmir, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Baris] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pulmonol, Izmir, Turkey; [Tokur, Murat E.] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Izmir, Turkey; [Ergan, Begum] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pulmonol & Intens Care, Izmir, Turkey; [Comert, Bilgin] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med & Intens Care, Izmir, Turkey","Savran, Y (corresponding author), Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Izmir, Turkey.",yusuf.savran@deu.edu.tr,"Mengi, Tuğçe/AAA-4505-2022; Cömert, Bilgin/P-3030-2019; Savran, Yusuf/AAI-1796-2019; Ergan, Begum/U-8276-2017","Cömert, Bilgin/0000-0002-2148-5356; Ergan, Begum/0000-0003-2920-9214",,,"Benites-Zapata VA, 2015, AM J CARDIOL, V115, P57, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2014.10.00; de Jager CPC, 2010, CRIT CARE, V14, DOI 10.1186/cc930; Gurol G, 2015, J MICROBIOL BIOTECHN, V25, P521, DOI 10.4014/jmb.1408.0806; Hwang SY, 2017, AM J EMERG MED, V35, P234, DOI 10.1016/j.ajem.2016.10.05; Korkmaz P, 2017, J CLIN ANAL MED, V8, P211, DOI 10.4328/JCAM.481; Liu X, 2016, MEDIAT INFLAMM, V2016, DOI DOI 10.1155/2016/819125; Lowsby R, 2015, EMERG MED J, V32, P531, DOI 10.1136/emermed-2014-20407; OKASHAH AS, 2014, RES OPIN ANESTH INTE, V0002, P0003; Park JJ, 2013, AM J CARDIOL, V111, P636, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2012.11.01; Rhodes A, 2017, INTENS CARE MED, V43, P304, DOI 10.1007/s00134-017-4683-; Riche F, 2015, CRIT CARE, V19, DOI 10.1186/s13054-015-1144-; Salciccioli JD, 2015, CRIT CARE, V19, DOI 10.1186/s13054-014-0731-; Sandquist M, 2014, EXPERT REV CLIN IMMU, V10, P1349, DOI 10.1586/1744666X.2014.94967; Singer M, 2016, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V315, P801, DOI 10.1001/jama.2016.028; Terradas R, 2012, PLOS ONE, V7, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.004286; Vincent JL, 2013, EXPERT REV ANTI-INFE, V11, P265, DOI [10.1586/eri.13.9, 10.1586/ERI.13.9; Yodying H, 2016, ANN SURG ONCOL, V23, P646, DOI 10.1245/s10434-015-4869-; Zhang HB, 2016, EXP THER MED, V12, P2215, DOI 10.3892/etm.2016.358",18,2,2,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,877.0,882,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_134,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000038,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001859504132231405,3.239138941046981e-17,0.0035094935871218167,0.08295554850928537,0.0035094935871218167

Conclusion: The time plot of the main parameters afforded by the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Instrumental Assessment and by the Romberg Test performed on a Force Platform actually confirmed that different OMTs challenge different Autonomic components and can achieve different responses in quiet upright stance balance control.,"[Scoppa, Fabio; Belloni, Gabriele] Sapienza Univ Rome, Fac Med & Dent Surg, Posturol, Rome, Italy; [Scoppa, Fabio; Belloni, Gabriele] Chinesis IFOP Osteopathy Sch, Rome, Italy; [Pirino, Alessio] Univ Sassari, Dept Biomed Sci, Sassari, Italy; [Messina, Giuseppe; Iovane, Angelo] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy","Messina, G (corresponding author), Via Giovanni Pascoli 6, I-90144 Palermo, Italy.",17@unipa.it,"Messina, Giuseppe/N-7298-2019; PIRINO, ALESSIO/ABG-2384-2020","Messina, Giuseppe/0000-0003-2774-4950; PIRINO, ALESSIO/0000-0001-5369-7284",,,"AKSELROD S, 1981, SCIENCE, V213, P220, DOI 10.1126/science.616604; Baratto L, 2002, MOTOR CONTROL, V6, P246, DOI 10.1123/mcj.6.3.24; Bianco A, 2014, AGING CLIN EXP RES, V26, P147, DOI 10.1007/s40520-013-0144-; Burns L, 2000, J OSTEOPATH MED, V100, P249, DOI 10.7556/jaoa.2000.100.4.24; Camm AJ, 1996, EUR HEART J, V17, P35; Fornari M, 2017, J AM OSTEOPATH ASSOC, V117, P559, DOI 10.7556/jaoa.2017.11; Giles PD, 2013, J ALTERN COMPLEM MED, V19, P92, DOI 10.1089/acm.2011.003; Gurfinkel V, 2006, J NEUROPHYSIOL, V96, P2678, DOI 10.1152/jn.00406.200; Gurfinkel Victor S, 2011, J Vis Exp, DOI 10.3791/367; Henley Charles E, 2008, Osteopath Med Prim Care, V2, P7, DOI 10.1186/1750-4732-2-; Jacono M, 2004, MOTOR CONTROL, V8, P292, DOI 10.1123/mcj.8.3.29; Jakel A, 2011, J AM OSTEOPATH ASSOC, V111, P68; Kang HG, 2013, GAIT POSTURE, V38, P757, DOI 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2013.03.02; Kapteyn T S, 1983, Agressologie, V24, P32; Lopez D, 2011, J AM OSTEOPATH ASSOC, V111, P382, DOI 10.7556/jaoa.2011.111.6.38; Martines F, 2016, EUR ARCH OTO-RHINO-L, V273, P1419, DOI 10.1007/s00405-015-3714-; Martines F, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P90; Messina Giuseppe, 2017, Eur J Transl Myol, V27, P6363, DOI 10.4081/ejtm.2017.636; Milnes K, 2007, INT J OSTEOPATH MED, V10, P8, DOI 10.1016/j.ijosm.2007.01.00; Noll DR, 2013, J AM OSTEOPATH ASSOC, V113, P1; Northup GW, 1945, J AM OSTEOPATH ASSOC, V100, P64; Pagani M, 1984, J HYPERTENS        S, V2, pS38; Parvan K, 2013, MED BALTIM, V2, P295, DOI DOI 10.1097/MD.000000000000241; Patti A., 2015, J BIOLOGICAL RES, V88, P11; Patti A, 2017, INT J ENV RES PUB HE, V14, DOI 10.3390/ijerph1407080; Patti A, 2017, WORK, V57, P23, DOI 10.3233/WOR-17253; Ruffini N, 2015, FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ, V9, DOI 10.3389/fnins.2015.0027; Salvago P, 2017, INT J AUDIOL, V56, P148, DOI 10.1080/14992027.2016.123641; Scoppa F, 2017 ACTA MED MEDIT; Scoppa F, 2013, GAIT POSTURE, V37, P290, DOI 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2012.07.00; Waitley DD, 1948, J AM OSTEOPATH ASSOC, V100, P65; Younes M, 2017, CHIROPR MAN THER, V25, DOI 10.1186/s12998-017-0167-",32,1,1,2,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,431.0,436,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_68,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400022,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003305785123966942,1.2242231500565467e-11,0.0058694620243054125,0.10333600213504136,0.005864695189873937

It is still unknown whether and how miRNA-222 played a part in esophageal cancer. Herein, we aimed to investigate the roles of miR-222 in esophageal cancer cells, particularly in regulating response to proliferation. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line, TE11 cells, was transfected with miR-222 mimic, inhibitor or their negative controls. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and EdU incorporation assay were used to analyze Cell proliferation. MiR-222 and expression levels of its putative target genes (p27 and p57) were detected using qRT-PCR and Western blot. Our results showed that overexpression of miR-222 enhanced TE11 cell proliferation, and expression level of p27Kip1 was negatively moderated by miR-222 up-regulation at post-transcriptional level. Finally, we transfected miR-222 inhibitor and p27 si-RNA into TE11 cells, and found that proliferation-suppressing effects of miR-222 inhibitor on TE11 cells could be partially reversed by silencing p27, indicating that p27 is a target gene of miR-222 during TE11 cell proliferation. Our data suggests that miR-222 overexpression controls TE11 cell growth by down-regulating p27.

The present pilot study aims to evaluate behavioral aspects in a small population of siblings of ASD children. Material and methods: Population: 5 school-aged children (2 males, 3 females) (mean age 9.235 +/- 2.041) were enrolled, as siblings of ASD children, and for comparison, 12 healthy (7 males, 5 females) children (average age 9,528 +/- 3,351). All subjects underwent evaluation of the behavioral with Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scale. Results: The two groups were statistically comparable by age (p = 0.86) and gender distribution (p = 0.87). From the behavioral point of view evaluated with the CBCL scale, siblings of ASD have a higher degree of overall problem (Total problems) compared to control children (p=0.003), in addition they have significantly higher scores in the subscales of behavior examined (Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints, Social, Thought, Attention, Delinquent, Aggressive) as well as a greater share of disturbances both internalizing (p=0.004) and externalizing (p = 0.007) (Table 1). Conclusions: The present preliminary data confirm the need for a global management of the entire family structure for the correct management of Autistic Disorders.","[Sorrentino, Michele] Pineta Grande Hosp, NICU Preterm & High Risk Newborn Neurodev Follow, Castel Volturno, CE, Italy;

There are two types of orexin peptides: the orexin-A (OXA or hypocretin 1) and orexin-B (OXB or hypocretin 2). The Majority of the central nervous system orexin peptides are synthesized in neurons located in the lateral and back hypothalamus and send projections throughout the brain regions Orexin neurons are multi-tasking hence regulating also energy homeostasis, reward systems and feeding behaviour through connection with hypothalamic nuclei and through responsiveness to leptine and glucose. It has recently been found a connection with lymbic system suggesting a further possible role of orexins in regulating emotions. All the studies conducted confirm that orexin system regulates vigilance states, energy homeostasis, reward system, and emotions. These crucial role might be the target to develope treatments of narcolepsy, obesity, emotional stress, and drug addiction.","[Sperandeo, Raffaele] Univ Campania, Dept Expt Med, Sect Human Physiol, Naples, Italy;

Current studies interpret this relationship as a linear concatenation that starts from a damage of the prefrontal cortical areas, produces a deficit of the executive functions and finally evolves towards the development of pathological character traits. In an enacted cognition perspective, the relationship between executive functions and personality should be interpreted according to a circular causality model that appears ecologically more realistic and adequate to empirical data. The present study evaluates executive functions and personality dimensions in a sample of 130 subjects using the Frontal Assessment Battery, the Temperament and Character Inventory, respectively. The results show that subjects with low empathic and emotional propensities, detected through 9 items of Temperament and Character Inventory, while not presenting any kind of disturbances, show Executive Functions that are not efficient or even inadequate. These data are not easily explained according to the classic linear model and seem to confirm the circular perspective proposed by the embodied cognition theory. However, an expansion of the sample is essential to obtain confirmation of the data that emerged.","[Sperandeo, Raffaele; Moretto, Enrico; Di Sarno, Alfonso Davide; Longobardi, Teresa] SiPGI Postgrad Sch Integrated Gestalt Psychothera, DM 12-10-2007,Via V Veneto 240, I-80058 Naples, Italy;

On the other hand, however, it has also raised the risk linked to professional responsibility, regarding informed consent and law 24/2017 of the Italian Republic, better known as Gelli Bianco. In this work an analysis of relevant literature will be presented, followed by a study on the role of new devices on responsibility profiles in otolaryngology. According to the analysis of the Italian law and considering the weaknesses of the above mentioned guidelines, pending legal administrative clarifications, we believe an operational protocol can be proposed in case of application of therapeutical innovations, especially about experimental introductions. Consequently, in our opinion, the risk of incrimination persists in case of use of innovative procedures in the absence of a formal shared opinion expressed in guidelines or in good practices, which still need a satisfactory definition.","[Spinato, Giacomo; Tonoli, Giovanni] Rovigo Prov Hosp, Ear Nose & Throat Dept, I-45100 Rovigo, Italy; [Cazzato, Giorgio; Politi, Doriano] Mestre Hosp, Prov Ear Nose & Throat Dept Venice, I-30174 Venice, Italy; [Ferlito, Salvatore; Conti, Angelo; Campione, Gianluca; Di Luca, Milena; Serra, Agostino] Univ Catania, Ear Nose & Throat Dept, I-95125 Catania, Italy; [Tirelli, Giancarlo; Gatto, Annalisa; Piovesana, Marco] Univ Trieste, Cattinara Hosp, Ear Nose & Throat Dept, I-34149 Trieste, Italy; [Rizzo, Paolo Boscolo; Da Mosto, Maria Cristina] Univ Padua, Treviso Prov Hosp, Dept Neurosci, Ear Nose & Throat Clin, I-35122 Padua, Italy; [Rizzo, Paolo Boscolo; Da Mosto, Maria Cristina] Univ Padua, Treviso Prov Hosp, Reg Ctr Head & Neck Canc, I-35122 Padua, Italy; [Galletti, Bruno] Univ Messina, Dept Otolaryngol, Messina, Italy","Spinato, G (corresponding author), Rovigo Prov Hosp, Ear Nose & Throat Dept, I-45100 Rovigo, Italy.",giacomo.spinato@aulss5.veneto.it,"salvatore, ferlito/AAB-5788-2021; tirelli, giancarlo/G-3118-2012","salvatore, ferlito/0000-0001-7136-9698; tirelli, giancarlo/0000-0002-7871-2011; Cocuzza, Salvatore/0000-0002-6135-0958; BOSCOLO RIZZO, PAOLO/0000-0002-4635-7959; Spinato, Giacomo/0000-0001-5295-5077",,,"[Anonymous], 1997, EUR TREAT SER, V16; Ausoni S, 2016, CANCER METAST REV, V35, P413, DOI 10.1007/s10555-016-9625-; Barbash GI, 2010, NEW ENGL J MED, V363, P701, DOI 10.1056/NEJMp100660; Boscolo-Rizzo P, 2015, EUR ARCH OTO-RHINO-L, V272, P3491, DOI 10.1007/s00405-014-3369-; Boscolo-Rizzo P, 2015, ORAL ONCOL, V51, P500, DOI 10.1016/j.oraloncology.2015.02.10; Caltabiano R, 2012, EUR REV MED PHARMACO, V16, P189; Caltabiano R, 2008, PATHOLOGICA, V100, P18; Cherry J, 2000, J LARYNGOL OTOL, V114, P73; Cocuzza S, 2014, J VOICE, V28, P245, DOI 10.1016/j.jvoice.2013.08.00; Cocuzza S, 2013, EUR ARCH OTO-RHINO-L, V270, P1879, DOI 10.1007/s00405-013-2430-; Da Mosto MC, 2013, ANN SURG ONCOL, V20, P250, DOI 10.1245/s10434-012-2520-; Dawes PJD, 1999, CLIN OTOLARYNGOL, V24, P198, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2273.1999.00244.; De Nicola E, 1947, CONSTITUTION ITALIA; Ferri E, 2013, INT J SURG ONCOL, V2013, DOI 10.1155/2013/36934; Gallina S, 2015, ACTA OTORHINOLARYNGO, V35, P1; Germonpre P, 2016, B-ENT, V12, P8; Giacomarra V, 2013, EUR ARCH OTO-RHINO-L, V270, P2975, DOI 10.1007/s00405-013-2625-; Institute of Medicine, 2011, CLIN PRACT GUID WE ; Jouanneau E., 2011, ADV ENDOSCOPIC SUR; Karpishchenko S.

The aerobic exercise protocol included warming up; main program and cooling down phases lasted for 8 consecutive weeks (5 days/week). The daily intake of omega-3 supplement was 2,000 milligrams. Lipid profiles and the Depression were measured before and after 8 weeks of exercise intervention and supplementation. Results: There was a significant decrease in total cholesterol and LDL in aerobic exercise, aerobic exercise + omega-3, and omega-3 groups and there was a significant increase in HDL in the three groups (p=0.05). Compared to the omega-3 supplement group, aerobic exercise group and aerobic exercise+omega-3 supplement group had lower total cholesterol and LDL levels and higher HDL after intervention (p=0.05). In addition, in all three experimental groups, depression showed a significant improvement (p=0.05). The aerobic exercise group and the aerobic+omega-3 supplement group showed a more significant improvement compared to the omega-3 supplement group in terms of depression (p=0.05). Conclusion: Given the findings of this study, aerobic exercise and omega-3 supplement simultaneously improve the blood lipids and depression in women. Since blood lipids are improved in the prevention of obesity and related diseases, including depression, omega-3 consumption and aerobic exercise in interaction are recommended for women.","[Taheri, Morteza; Irandoust, Khadijeh; Sadeghi, Abbas] Imam Khomeini Int Univ, Dept Sport Sci, Fac Social Sci, Qazvin, Iran; [Yari, Shokoofe] Imam Khomeini Int Univ, Dept Sport Sci, Fac Social Sci, Exercise Physiol, Qazvin, Iran","Taheri, M (corresponding author), Imam Khomeini Int Univ, Dept Sport Sci, Fac Social Sci, Qazvin, Iran.",taheri_morteza@yahoo.com,"Taheri, Morteza/N-5170-2016; irandoust, khadijeh/ABH-3519-2021","Taheri, Morteza/0000-0001-8031-3792; ",,,"Altena TS, 2006, MED SCI SPORT EXER, V38, P367, DOI 10.1249/01.mss.0000185088.33669.f; Amini M, 2018, INT J SPORT STUD HL; Bianco A, 2010, J SPORT MED PHYS FIT, V50, P15; Budania S, 2014, MED J DY PATIL U, V7, P54; Colussi Gianluca, 2007, Recent Pat Cardiovasc Drug Discov, V2, P13, DOI 10.2174/15748900777960615; Dangardt F, 2010, ATHEROSCLEROSIS, V212, P580, DOI 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2010.06.04; Dunn AL, 2002, CONTROL CLIN TRIALS, V23, P584, DOI 10.1016/S0197-2456(02)00226-; Hesar KM, 2013, IRANIAN J ENDOCRINOL, V14, P47; Irandoost K, 2015, SALMAND, V10, P4; Irandoust K, 2017, PHYS PHYSL LITERAC; Irandoust K, 2017, ASIAN J SPORTS MED, V; Irandoust K, 2015, J PHYS THER SCI, V27, P433, DOI 10.1589/jpts.27.43; Jafari M, 2017, INT J SPORT STUD HL; Jee SH, 2011, EUR HEART J, V32, P2773, DOI 10.1093/eurheartj/ehr22; Jensky-Squires NE, 2008, BRIT J NUTR, V100, P859, DOI 10.1017/S000711450892546; Kannan U, 2014, J CLIN DIAGN RES, V8, pBC8, DOI 10.7860/JCDR/2014/8519.461; Kong A, 2012, J ACAD NUTR DIET, V112, P1428, DOI 10.1016/j.jand.2012.05.01; Lee HC, 2014, J PHYS THER SCI, V26, P1675, DOI 10.1589/jpts.26.167; Liperoti R, 2009, CURR PHARM DESIGN, V15, P4165, DOI 10.2174/13816120978990968; Maes M, 1997, ACTA PSYCHIAT SCAND, V95, P212, DOI 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1997.tb09622.; Mann S, 2014, SPORTS MED, V44, P211, DOI 10.1007/s40279-013-0110-; Mohammadpour A, 2015, J PHARM CARE, V1, P2; Noorian F., 2017, ACTA MED MEDITERRANE, V3; Olusi SO, 1996, BIOL PSYCHIAT, V40, P1128, DOI 10.1016/S0006-3223(95)00599-; Paoli A, 2015, MAR DRUGS, V13, P996, DOI 10.3390/md1302099; Paoli A, 2012, AM J CARDIOL, V109, P305, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2011.10.01; Rahman A., 2015, INVESTIGATION PREVAL, V2015, P1; Rogers PJ, 2008, BRIT J NUTR, V99, P421, DOI 10.1017/S000711450780109; Ruljancic N, 2011, PROG NEURO-PSYCHOPH, V35, P1261, DOI 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2011.02.00; Sarshar N, 2006, OFOGH E DANESH J GON, V12, P3; Sayyah M, 2011, BIOSCI BIOTECH RES A, V8, P367, DOI DOI 10.13005/bbra/87; Schachter H M, 2005, Evid Rep Technol Assess (Summ), P; Shibata H, 1999, J Epidemiol, V9, P26; Simopoulos Artemis P, 2007, Curr Sports Med Rep, V6, P230, DOI 10.1007/s11932-007-0037-; Sneddon AA, 2008, OBESITY, V16, P1019, DOI 10.1038/oby.2008.4; Surette ME, 2008, CAN MED ASSOC J, V178, P177, DOI 10.1503/cmaj.07135; Zorba E, 2011, J SPORT MED PHYS FIT, V51, P66",37,1,1,1,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,865.0,870,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_132,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000036,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003822314049586777,2.1857493499624227e-08,0.010712593251642177,0.10046391913069651,0.010712593251642177

Materials and methods: Use 5% imiquimod cream for 8 weeks regularly, and detect the expression of VEGF in peripheral blood of VEGF mRNA by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR in before and after treatment groups. Results: The clinical efficacy of imiquimod for basal cell carcinoma was significant; the expression levels of VEGF mRNA in before/after treatment group were significantly higher than those of normal group (p<0.05); In the meantime, the expression level in after treatment group were obvious lower than that in before group(p<0.05). Conclusion: The therapeutic effect of imiquimod for basal cell carcinoma may be related to the decreased expression of VEGF mRNA in the peripheral blood.","[Tan, Rui; Tang, Nina; Zhang, Yuan; Mei, Yijie; Sun, Ledong] Southern Med Univ, Zhujiang Hosp, Dept Dermatol, 253 Ind Rd, Guangzhou 510282, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Sun, LD (corresponding author), Southern Med Univ, Zhujiang Hosp, Dept Dermatol, 253 Ind Rd, Guangzhou 510282, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",sunledong126@126.com,,,,,"Anwar U, 2006, PLAST RECONSTR SURG, V117, p6E, DOI 10.1097/01.prs.0000194908.32762.e; Carbone A, 2011, EUR J DERMATOL, V21, P608, DOI 10.1684/ejd.2011.131; Gabhann FM, 2008, MICROCIRCULATION, V15, P715, DOI 10.1080/1073968080209596; Hahn H, 1996, CELL, V85, P841, DOI 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81268-; Hesling C, 2004, BRIT J DERMATOL, V150, P761, DOI 10.1111/j.0007-0963.2004.05898.; Imai Y, 2015, J IMMUNOL, V195, P421, DOI 10.4049/jimmunol.150044; Jiang HH, 2012, MED RECAPITULATE, V18, P29; Jimeno A, 2013, CLIN CANCER RES, V19, P2766, DOI 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-365; Leng FF, 2017, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V33, P1085, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_17; Li Vincent W, 2008, J Drugs Dermatol, V7, ps1; Majewski S, 2005, INT J DERMATOL, V44, P14, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-4632.2004.02318.; Nagarajan S, 2002, CANCER RES, V62, P286; Oh CK, 2003, J DERMATOL, V30, P306, DOI 10.1111/j.1346-8138.2003.tb00392.; Sekulic A, 2012, NEW ENGL J MED, V366, P2171, DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa111371; Sobjanek M, 2014, ARCH DERMATOL RES, V306, P539, DOI 10.1007/s00403-014-1471-; Sterry W, 2002, BRIT J DERMATOL, V147, P1227, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2133.2002.05069.; Tang S, 2016, AUSTRALAS J DERMATO; Tokluoglu S, 2017, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V33, P145, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1_02; Vuletic MS, 2014, J BUON, V19, P78; Wang XY, 2011, CLIN EXP DERMATOL, V36, P69, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2230.2010.03860.; Wu CS, 2014, DNA CELL BIOL, V33, P652, DOI 10.1089/dna.2014.236; Yla-Herttuala S, 2007, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V49, P1015, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2006.09.05; Zhong CG, 2014, EXPRESSION CYCLIND; 彭军, 2007, [中华皮肤科杂志, Chinese Journa of Dermatology], V40, P16",24,0,0,1,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1351.0,1355,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_207,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700029,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0024793388429752063,8.129199087463593e-05,0.0047466654826543615,0.09216853130207094,0.0047466654826543615

Major complication includes wound infection, hematoma, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, hypoparathyroidism. Tracheal injury associated with thyroidectomy is rare, but when it occurs it can be very dangerous. Tracheal perforation is generally not considered a complication as such, but rather atechnical occurrence during surgery that requires expeditious attention. Tracheal perforation, if encountered, needs to be managed appropriately incenters of expertise for high volume of thyroidectomy.","[Tartaglia, Nicola; Iadarola, Roberta; Di Lascia, Alessandra; Fersini, Alberto;

Results: Compared with NC group, the levels of PA, ALB, A / G, APOA1, APOA1 / B and IL-10 were decreased in MC group, and the levels of GLO, IL-1 beta, ANCA, VEGF and E IL-1 beta, ANCA, VEGF, E-selectin, PAF, GMP-140 and CD40L in MTX, TPT and XFC groups were significantly lower than those in MC group (P <0.05), While the XFC group in the rise of PA, ALB, APOA1, APOA1 / B and other aspects was significantly better than other treatment groups. (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Compared with TPT and MTX group, the body weight of XFC group increased (P < 0.05), and the arthritis index of XFC group was significantly lower than that before treatment, VEGF, E-selectin, PAF decreased, IL-10 was significantly increased (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Xinfeng Capsule can reduce the arthritis of adjuvant arthritis rats and improve the body weight and regulate protein metabolism. The mechanism is that by down-regulating the expression of cytokines IL-1 beta, ANCA, VEGF, E-selectin, GMP-140, CD40L, Upregulates the expression of cytokines IL-10, inhibits inflammatory effects, enhances anti-inflammatory effects, inhibits vasculitis formation, improves microvascular circulation, regulates protein metabolism in vivo.","[Wan Lei; Liu Jian; Huang Chuan-Bing; Wang Yuan; Shen Xi; Zhang Wan-Dong; Wang Gui-Zheng; Fan Hai-Xia; Ge Yao; Chen Rui-Lian; Cao Yun-Xiang; Zong Rui-Kai; Liu Tian-Yang] Anhui Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Rheumatol, Hefei 230031, Anhui, Peoples R China","Liu, J (corresponding author), Anhui Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Rheumatol, Hefei 230031, Anhui, Peoples R China.",,,,National Natural Science Foundation [81403388]; Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [1508085QH159]; Anhui Provincial Key Laboratory of Modern Traditional Chinese Medicine Internal Medicine Application Foundation and Development Research [1606c08238]; Anhui University Natural Science Research Project [KJ2017A281],"This paper belongs to the project of the National Natural Science Foundation Project (81403388).

Levels of seretonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), acetylcholine (Ach), gamma-aminobutyric acid (gamma-GABA) and glutamate (Glu) were measured in the cerebral cortex. 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1A R), NE alpha 2 receptor (NE alpha 2R) mRNAs and proteins were detected by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively, in the hippocampus and raphe nucleus. Results: Compared with the model group, the acupuncture group had a lower Zea Longa score, higher sugar consumption, higher exercise level and greater number of vertical movements in the open field test (P <0.01 or P <0.05). The ultrastructural changes of hippocampal neurons were obvious and the damage to neurons was severe. There were fewer ultrastructural changes in hippocampal neurons in the acupuncture and drug groups compared with those in the model group. After treatment, levels of 5-HTT and 5HT1A R mRNA and protein in the brain tissue of PSD model rats were decreased, and levels of Ach, gamma-GABA, and Glu, and 5-HTT and 5-HT1A R mRNA and protein were significantly higher in the cortex of the acupuncture group compared with those in the untreated group (P <0.01). The mRNA and protein levels of NE alpha 2R mRNA and protein in the hippocampus, (P <0.01). The mRNA and protein levels of Ach, gamma-GABA, Glu and NE alpha 2R were decreased (P <0.01 or P <0.05). Conclusion: Jieyuanshen acupuncture can significantly improve the behavioral changes of post-stroke depression rats, and may up-regulate the levels of 5-HT and NE in the cerebral cortex, down-regulate the expression of Ach, gamma-GABA and Glu, and promote hippocampus, 5-HTT, 5-HT1A R, NE alpha 2R, inhibit the expression of NE alpha 2R, reduce the organic damage of hippocampus, and provide neuroprotective effect.","[Xiao Wei; Zhang Xianbao; Wang Zhen; Guo Xiaoli] Anhui Univ Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp 2, Hefei 230001, Anhui, Peoples R China; [He Ling] Anhui Univ Chinese Med, Hefei 230001, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Wang Yan] Anqing Municipal Hosp, Anqing 246000, Peoples R China","Xiao, W (corresponding author), Care of Jian L, Dept Rheumatol, Anhui Univ Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Hefei 230031, Anhui, Peoples R China.",liujianahzy@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation Project: Study on the Mechanism of Acupuncture Intervention on Post-stroke Depression by Using Neurotransmitter Receptor PCR Chip Technology [81273857],Fund Project: National Natural Science Foundation Project: Study on the Mechanism of Acupuncture Intervention on Post-stroke Depression by Using Neurotransmitter Receptor PCR Chip Technology (81273857),"[Anonymous], 2014, J ACUPUNCTURE MOXIBU, V39, P13; Carnes-Vendrell A, 2016, REV NEUROLOGIA, V62, P460, DOI 10.33588/rn.6210.201547; Das SK, 2016, NEUROSCI LETT, V612, P231, DOI 10.1016/j.neulet.2015.12.03; Ding XH, 2016, METAB BRAIN DIS, V31, P279, DOI 10.1007/s11011-015-9748-; Llorca GE, 2015, NEUROLOGIA, V30, P23, DOI 10.1016/j.nrl.2012.06.00; Fan WT, 2012, NEURAL REGEN RES, V7, P187, DOI 10.3969/j.issn.1673-5374.2012.03.00; Feng C, 2014, J SCI WORLD, V2014, P521; Finkelmeyer A, 2016, PSYCHOL MED, V46, P2157, DOI 10.1017/S003329171600070; Ji XW, 2014, EXP THER MED, V8, P159, DOI 10.3892/etm.2014.167; Koizumi J., 1986, JPN J STROKE, V8, P; Le JJ, 2016, NEUROSCI LETT, V615, P66, DOI 10.1016/j.neulet.2016.01.00; Li JF, 2016, J AFFECT DISORDERS, V197, P215, DOI 10.1016/j.jad.2016.03.03; Li Y, 2015, CHINESE MED J-PEKING, V128, P2926, DOI 10.4103/0366-6999.16805; Liu Dan, 2010, ZHONGGUO JING BAO JI, V13, P38; LONGA EZ, 1989, STROKE, V20, P84, DOI 10.1161/01.STR.20.1.8; Loubinoux I, 2012, J CELL MOL MED, V16, P1961, DOI 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2012.01555.; Manning KJ, 2016, BIOL PSYCHIAT, V80, pE1, DOI 10.1016/j.biopsych.2016.05.00; Nabavi SF, 2015, CURR MED CHEM, V22, P34; Qian XL, 2015, J ALTERN COMPLEM MED, V21, P748, DOI 10.1089/acm.2015.008; Queirazza F, 2014, J NEUROL NEUROSUR PS, V85, P241, DOI 10.1136/jnnp-2012-30414; Robinson RG, 2016, AM J PSYCHIAT, V173, P221, DOI 10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.1503036; Sun Yi, 2007, CHINESE J STROKE, V2, P89; Tanahashi N, 2016, NEUROSCI LETT, V618, P99, DOI 10.1016/j.neulet.2016.02.05; Tang MM, 2016, PHYSIOL BEHAV, V161, P166, DOI 10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.04.03; Terroni L, 2015, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V11, P233, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S7372; Wei CJ, 2016, INT J NEUROSCI, V126, P623, DOI 10.3109/00207454.2015.105104; Werheid K, 2016, GERONTOLOGY, V62, P33, DOI 10.1159/00038187; WILLNER P, 1987, PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY, V93, P35; Wiwanitkit V, 2014, NEURAL REGEN RES, V9, P1248, DOI 10.4103/1673-5374.13532; Xu Shuyun, 1994, PHARM EXPT METHOD, P64; Young KD, 2016, BRAIN BEHAV IMMUN, V56, P335, DOI 10.1016/j.bbi.2016.04.00; Zhang C, 2015, EVID-BASED COMPL ALT, V2015, P49; Zhang JP, 2014, NEURAL REGEN RES, V9, P773, DOI 10.4103/1673-5374.13159; Zhao Q, 2016, MOL NEUROBIOL, V53, P1699, DOI 10.1007/s12035-015-9120-",34,0,0,6,21,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,2.0,,,,,507.0,515,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_2_82,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GB7TQ,WOS:000429278400035,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003512396694214876,1.8659868131651142e-17,0.00680691093182053,0.07060488253185608,0.00680691093182053

Methods: Gefitinib (R) - resistant cells strain HCC827 GR were exposed gradually to increasing concentrations of Gefitinib (R), and the IC50 value of the drug was determined by MTT assay. The Cx43 mRNA expression was measured using RT-PCR, while the protein and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) levels were determined with Western blot. Immunofluorescence technique was used for the analysis of the Cx43 cells. Results: The IC50 values of Gefitinib (R) for HCC827 and HCC827 GR were 0.075 +/- 0.013 and 10.67 +/- 0.027 mu mol/L, respectively, and differed significantly (p < 0.05). The expression levels of mRNA and protein of Cx43 in HCC827 GR were significantly lower than those of HCC827 (p < 0.05), while the protein level of p-Akt was significantly increased (p < 0.05). When LT294002, the specific inhibitor of PI3K was added to HCC827 GR, the protein expression level of p-Akt was significantly reduced (p < 0.05), while that of Cx43 was significantly increased (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The down-regulation of Cx43 in the cytoplasm of patients with NSCLC is associated with acquired resistance of NSCLC cells to Gefitinib (R), most likely due to the activation of PI3K / Akt signal pathway of Cx43 non-GJIC-dependent. Thus, measurement of levels of Cx43 is a useful guide during the treatment of NSCLC.","[Xue-Mei, Xia; Dian-Ming, Li; Jun-Feng, Hu; Yong, Zhang; Shan, Gao] Bengbu Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Bengbu, Anhui, Peoples R China","Dian-Ming, L (corresponding author), Bengbu Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Bengbu, Anhui, Peoples R China.",yxogy6@163.com,,,,,"Cichon MA, 2014, ONCOGENE, V33, P4185, DOI 10.1038/onc.2013.38; D'Alfonso TM, 2014, J CLIN PATHOL, V67, P690, DOI 10.1136/jclinpath-2013-20216; Lee CH, 2014, ANN SURG ONCOL, V21, P1031, DOI 10.1245/s10434-013-3400-; Liu X, 2014, ONCOL REP, V31, P745, DOI 10.3892/or.2013.291; Neal CP, 2014, J SURG ONCOL, V110, P828, DOI 10.1002/jso.2371; Torre LA, 2015, CA-CANCER J CLIN, V65, P87, DOI 10.3322/caac.2126; WANG Junjie, 2016, ORAL MEDCINE, V36, P33; Wang W.J., 2017, MOBILE INFORM SYSTEM, V2017, P1, DOI DOI 10.1080/09540105.2017.136025; Yue CH, 2016, MOL MED REP, V14, P1636, DOI 10.3892/mmr.2016.542",9,0,0,1,12,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,4.0,,,,,1037.0,1040,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4_158,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ1AT,WOS:000434986500021,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0009297520661157025,1.1635333645714892e-11,0.0016522948634643119,0.10479252595455382,0.0016522948634643119

Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a marker of platelet activation and function. Method: 204 children were included in this study in three ,groups; healthy children aged 3 - 48 months (control, group, Group 2), patients diagnosed with acute bronchiolitis in our clinic and then hospitalized (severe cases, group 1b) and patients diagnosed but not hospitalized (mild cases, Group 1a). Patients with a history of asthma, chronic disease or congenital anomaly were excluded. The clinical severity of acute bronchiolitis and the relations with WBC, CRP and MPV were compared between the groups. Results: Mean MPV values were 7.4 +/- 1.5 fL (4.6-10.3) in Group 2; 7.8 +/- 0.7 fL (6.5-10.1) in Group la and 8.3 +/- 1.0 fL (6.311.2) in Group 1b.While no difference was observed in terms of MPV between Group 2 and Group 1a(p=0.23), a significant difference was determined between Group 2 and Group 1b (<0.001). Discussion: MPV values in our study differed only in the severe patient group. In addition, no difference was observed between the mild and severe case groups in terms of other parameters apart from MPV. This finding shows that MPV values are correlated with severity of disease, that they rise significantly in moderate-severe cases and that they can therefore be used as a finding to assist clinicians in assessing the severity of the disease.","[Yildiz, Yasin; Cakmak, Semiha; Calapoglu, Tugba] Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Rize, Turkey; [Hocoglu, Zeynep I.; Karadeniz, Elif G.] Rize Publ Hosp, Dept Pediat, Rize, Turkey","Yildiz, Y (corresponding author), Rize Training & Res Hosp, Rize, Turkey.",yasinyildizmd@gmail.com,"yildiz, yasin/AAE-2806-2019; Yildiz, Yasin/AAG-7802-2021","Yildiz, Yasin/0000-0002-0602-7795",,,"Anmolsingh R, 2016, W INDIAN MED J, DOI [10.7727/wimj.2015.364, DOI 10.7727/WIMJ.2015.364; Aslan A, 2004, J CHILD HLTH DIS, V47, P20; Canpolat FE, 2009, PEDIATR INT, V51, P314, DOI 10.1111/j.1442-200X.2009.02820.; EVERARD ML, 1994, ARCH DIS CHILD, V71, P428, DOI 10.1136/adc.71.5.42; Fitzgerald DA, 2004, MED J AUSTRALIA, V180, P399, DOI 10.5694/j.1326-5377.2004.tb05993.; Gasparyan AY, 2011, CURR PHARM DESIGN, V17, P4; Gunes A, 2015, INT J CLIN EXP MED, V8, P1133; Kara TT, 2015, TURKISH J PED DIS, DOI [10.12956/tjpd.2015.187, DOI 10.12956/TJPD.2015.187; Karadag-Oncel E, 2013, ITAL J PEDIATR, V39, DOI 10.1186/1824-7288-39-1; Kutlug S, 2021, W INDIAN MED J, V69, P395, DOI 10.7727/wimj.2015.26; Lieberthal AS, 2006, PEDIATRICS, V118, P1774, DOI 10.1542/peds.2006-222; Makay B, 2009, CLIN RHEUMATOL, V28, P975, DOI 10.1007/s10067-009-1148-; Mannaioni PF, 1997, INFLAMM RES, V46, P4, DOI 10.1007/PL0000015; Martinez FD, 1999, J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUN, V104, pS169, DOI 10.1016/S0091-6749(99)70058-; Mochizuki H, 2000, PEDIATRICS, V106, P1442, DOI 10.1542/peds.106.6.144; OMalley T, 1996, BLOOD COAGUL FIBRIN, V7, P431, DOI 10.1097/00001721-199606000-0000; Park Y, 2002, PLATELETS, V13, P301, DOI 10.1080/09537100222014833; Schoene NW, 1997, AM J CLIN NUTR, V65, P166; Steiner RWP, 2004, AM FAM PHYSICIAN, V69, P32; Turkish Thoracic Society, 2009, TURKISH THORACIC ; Yeaman MR, 1997, CLIN INFECT DIS, V25, P951, DOI 10.1086/51612",21,0,0,2,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,6.0,,,,,1997.0,2000,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_6_311,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GX5TR,WOS:000447814400062,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0021694214876033058,2.713111155936179e-17,0.055519732705308716,0.0859611576339369,0.05478301509294946

Herein, we utilized HepG2-bearing mice model to explore the efficacy and feasibility of UGLI on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Material and methods: 26 BALB/c mice were inoculated subcutaneously with hepatoma HepG2 cells in right armpit. When subcutaneous tumor nodules developed, animals were respectively administered with intratumoral injection of lauromacrogol, ethanol or saline under ultrasound guidance. Ten days after treatment, tumor weight, histopathological as well as inflammatory infiltration extent and liver function variance were investigated. Results: Our datum demonstrated that lauromacrogol and ethanol nearly played equivalent tissue ablation effect on the hepatoma nodules as compared with saline. However, mice pretreated with lauromacrogol exhibited with less tissue inflammatory infiltration, liver injury. Conclusion: These results revealed that on the basis of nearly equivalent antitumor effect, lauromacrogol harbored less tissue impairment and side-effects, deserving further clinic promotion.","[Yin, Ming; Wang, Zhongyang; Xiao, Wei] Jiangsu Taizhou Peoples Hosp, Ultrason Unit, Taizhou 225300, Peoples R China","Wang, ZY (corresponding author), Jiangsu Taizhou Peoples Hosp, Ultrason Unit, Taizhou 225300, Peoples R China.",zhongyangwangdoc@163.com,,,,,"Acharya SK, 2014, J CLIN EXP HEPATOL, V4, pS27, DOI 10.1016/j.jceh.2014.05.01; Alazawi W, 2010, ALIMENT PHARM THER, V32, P344, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2010.04370.; CASTELLS A, 1993, HEPATOLOGY, V18, P112; Curley SA, 2000, ANN SURG, V232, P381, DOI 10.1097/00000658-200009000-0001; Huang H, 2015, INT J HYPERTHER, V31, P40, DOI 10.3109/02656736.2014.99901; Jemal A, 2011, CA-CANCER J CLIN, V61, P69, DOI [10.3322/caac.20107, 10.3322/caac.20115; Kang TW, 2015, LIVER CANCER, V4, P176, DOI 10.1159/00036774; Kosugi C, 2004, WORLD J SURG, V28, P29, DOI 10.1007/s00268-003-7003-; Kukura V, 2010, COLLEGIUM ANTROPOL, V34, P3; Liccioni A, 2014, DIGEST DIS, V32, P554, DOI 10.1159/00036050; LIVRAGHI T, 1995, RADIOLOGY, V197, P101, DOI 10.1148/radiology.197.1.756880; Llovet JM, 2012, J HEPATOL, V56, P908, DOI 10.1016/j.jhep.2011.12.00; Mancuso A, 2015, DIGEST LIVER DIS, V47, P324, DOI 10.1016/j.dld.2015.01.00; Mohandas KM, 2007, J GASTROENTEROL, V26, P26; Nakaji S, 2015, ENDOSCOPY, V47, pE558, DOI 10.1055/s-0034-139339; Sato D, 2012, EUR J VASC ENDOVASC, V44, P73, DOI 10.1016/j.ejvs.2012.04.00; Szary N, 2015, BIOMOLECULES, V5, P3295, DOI 10.3390/biom504329; Wang ZK, 2015, GASTROINTEST ENDOSC, V81, P1274, DOI 10.1016/j.gie.2014.08.01; Xue J, 2015, PAK J PHARM SCI, V28, P69; Zhong JH, 2015, MEDICINE, V94, DOI 10.1097/MD.000000000000039; Zimmet Steven E, 2003, Tech Vasc Interv Radiol, V6, P116, DOI 10.1053/S1089-2516(03)00044-",21,1,1,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,5.0,,,,,1331.0,1335,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_5_204,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GL3JV,WOS:000437030700026,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0021694214876033058,7.355972890105728e-15,0.004128175593578668,0.08705427402311255,0.004128175593578668

To date, although many loci, including genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been identified as risk variants of T2D, only approximately 10% of its heritability can be explained. In the current study, we proposed a data processing and analysis procedure to more accurately evaluate the association of the pathogenesis of T2D with copy number variations (CNVs). Methods: The data in our study came from the WTCCC (Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium) genome-wide CNV database. Individual CNVs were identified by SW-ARRAY and CBS algorithms and genotyped with a global threshold method. Overlapped CNVs among all samples were split into smaller but more accurate CNV segments (CNVSegs) after the CNV call; then, LASSO-based logistic regression models with 10-fold cross-validations were performed 100 times to examine the association of CNVSegs with T2D. The AUC (area under the curve) in every model was summarized to preliminarily verify the classification ability of the models. Results: After quality control, 1,813 T2D cases and 2,777 controls were enrolled in the study. A total of 65,163 CNVs were identified, of which 25,512 were identified in the T2D group and 39,651 were identified in the healthy control group. A total of 22,279 CNVSegs were constructed after pre-processing the raw CNV data. By means of fitting 1,000 logistic regression models with the LASSO method, 26 CNVSegs were identified as T2D-associated CNVSegs according to pre-defined criteria (Frequency > 85% & Length > = 50 bp). Twenty-seven protein-coding genes were found to be overlapped with the CNVSegs, of which 11 were verified to be relevant to T2D, obesity or metabolic syndrome based on current published evidence. The average AUC of all models was 0.611 with the maximum being 0.683. Conclusions: Our study explored T2D-associated CNVSegs by LASSO-logistic regression models from the perspective of the whole genome for a more complete understanding of the genetic mechanisms of T2D. Further studies are necessary to verify the influence of the susceptibility loci on the pathogenesis or progression of T2D among different populations.","[Zhang, Wei; Qin, Guoyou; Zhao, Naiqing] Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wei; Ying, Jun] Fudan Univ, Fudan Univ Lib, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Ji, Yuan] Northshore Univ HealthSyst, Evanston, IL 60201 USA; [Ji, Yuan] Univ Chicago, Med & Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Huang, Caihong] Xuhui Cent Hosp, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Ye, Zhengqiang] Fudan Univ, Eye & ENT Hosp, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China","Qin, GY; Zhao, NQ (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.",gyqin@fudan.edu.cn; nqzhao@fudan.edu.cn,,,NIH [2R01 CA132897],YJ's research is partly supported by NIH 2R01 CA132897.,"Aerts E, 2016, OBESITY, V24, P970, DOI 10.1002/oby.2143; Ashburner M, 2000, NAT GENET, V25, P25, DOI 10.1038/7555; Bae JS, 2011, PLOS ONE, V6, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.001909; Baeza-Raja B, 2012, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V109, P5838, DOI 10.1073/pnas.110363810; Bao MX, 2006, CHIN J CLIN REHABIL, V10, P14; Burton PR, 2007, NATURE, V447, P661, DOI 10.1038/nature0591; Crespo-Facorro B., 2014, INT J NEUROPSYCHOPHA, V1; Danaei G, 2011, LANCET, V378, P31, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60679-; Friedman J, 2010, J STAT SOFTW, V33, P1, DOI 10.18637/jss.v033.i0; Fukuda T, 2016, PLOS ONE, V11, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.016413; Grarup N, 2014, DIABETOLOGIA, V57, P1528, DOI 10.1007/s00125-014-3270-; Herder C, 2011, EUR J CLIN INVEST, V41, P679, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2010.02454.; Jeon JP, 2010, BMC GENOMICS, V11, DOI 10.1186/1471-2164-11-42; Kato N, 2013, J DIABETES INVEST, V4, P233, DOI 10.1111/jdi.1206; Lee HS, 2014, GENOMICS, V104, P113, DOI 10.1016/j.ygeno.2014.05.00; MacDonald JR, 2014, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V42, pD986, DOI 10.1093/nar/gkt95; Meigs JB, 2000, DIABETES, V49, P2201, DOI 10.2337/diabetes.49.12.220; Morris AP, 2012, NAT GENET, V44, P981, DOI 10.1038/ng.238; Murea Mariana, 2012, Rev Diabet Stud, V9, P6, DOI 10.1900/RDS.2012.9.; Olshen AB, 2004, BIOSTATISTICS, V5, P557, DOI 10.1093/biostatistics/kxh00; Pinto D, 2011, NAT BIOTECHNOL, V29, P512, DOI 10.1038/nbt.185; Plengvidhya N, 2012, GENE, V506, P383, DOI 10.1016/j.gene.2012.06.09; Price TS, 2005, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V33, P3455, DOI 10.1093/nar/gki64; Pundir S, 2017, METHODS MOL BIOL, V1558, P41, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4939-6783-4_; Rebhan M, 1997, TRENDS GENET, V13, P163, DOI 10.1016/S0168-9525(97)01103-; Redon R, 2006, NATURE, V444, P444, DOI 10.1038/nature0532; Robin X, 2011, BMC BIOINFORMATICS, V12, DOI 10.1186/1471-2105-12-7; Sanghera DK, 2012, J DIABETES METAB, V3, DOI 10.4172/2155-6156.100019; Sedova L, 2016, PLOS ONE, V11, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.015270; Slattery ML, 2011, MUTAT RES-FUND MOL M, V706, P13, DOI 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2010.10.00; Smushkin G, 2010, CURR OPIN CLIN NUTR, V13, P471, DOI 10.1097/MCO.0b013e32833a558; Tews D, 2014, MOL CELL ENDOCRINOL, V395, P41, DOI 10.1016/j.mce.2014.07.01; Tyner C, 2017, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V45, pD626, DOI 10.1093/nar/gkw113; Wang Y, 2014, PLOS ONE, V9, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.009250; World Health Organization, 1999, DEF DIAGN CLASS DI ; Yates A, 2016, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V44, pD710, DOI 10.1093/nar/gkv115; Zhao XN, 2013, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V110, P11023, DOI 10.1073/pnas.121772711",37,0,0,0,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,4.0,,,,,1143.0,1149,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_4_176,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ1AT,WOS:000434986500039,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003822314049586777,2.047915498211353e-20,0.031015131164940028,0.07190129912574557,0.031015131164940028

The myocardial infarction rat was established by ligating the left anterior descending coronary arteries. The infarction was evaluated by TTC staining. Traditional Chinese Medicines Xiaoxianxiong decoction and Guizhi Fuling Pills were administrated by gavage. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was monitored at week 2, 4 by M-Mode Sonography. The total cholesterol and triglyceride in serum were measured by biochemical auto-analyzer. The change in serous content of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Homocysteine (Hcy), nitric oxide (NO), endothelin (ET) were determined by ELISA and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in myocardial tissue were detected by Western Blot. We found that treatment with the combination of Xiaoxianxiong decoction and Guizhi Fuling Pills could increase the expression level of myocardial eNOS and serous NO concentration, lower the level of CRP, Hcy and ET simultaneously. A significant protective effect was observed in endothelial injury and myocardial infarction. Our results suggested combinational treatment with Xiaoxianxiong decoction and Guizhi Fuling Pills might conserve the vascular endothelium function by promotion the release of relaxing factors, inhibition of the release of contracting factors and reduction of coronary spasm and contraction.","[Zhu, Qiao; Zhang, Lei] Yantai Hosp Tradit Chinese Med, Dept Cardiol, 39 Xingfu Rd, Yantai 264013, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Ma, Jiede; Dong, Xian] Yantai Hosp Tradit Chinese Med, Dept Heart Dis, Yantai, Shandong, Peoples R China","Zhang, L (corresponding author), Yantai Hosp Tradit Chinese Med, Dept Cardiol, 39 Xingfu Rd, Yantai 264013, Shandong, Peoples R China.",zhanglei19811981@163.com,,,,,"Abrams Jonathan, 1996, American Journal of Cardiology, V77, p31C, DOI 10.1016/S0002-9149(96)00186-; Al-Azzam SI, 2012, ACTA CARDIOL, V67, P445, DOI 10.1080/AC.67.4.217068; [Anonymous], 2008, Harv Heart Lett, V18, P; Armitage JM, 2010, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V303, P2486, DOI 10.1001/jama.2010.84; Bhatraju P, 2015, NITRIC OXIDE-BIOL CH, V50, P114, DOI 10.1016/j.niox.2015.08.00; Cavallari Ilaria, 2017, Interv Cardiol Clin, V6, P119, DOI 10.1016/j.iccl.2016.08.00; Chen LL, 2017, CARDIOVASC DRUG THER, V31, P9, DOI 10.1007/s10557-016-6704-; Dong-mei X, 2013, INT J CLIN PRACT, V67, P1254, DOI 10.1111/ijcp.1217; Erdmann J, 2013, NATURE, V504, P432, DOI 10.1038/nature1272; Frangogiannis NG, 2012, CARDIOVASC RES, V96, P4, DOI 10.1093/cvr/cvs26; Gaeta R, 2014, LANCET, V383, P410, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60148-; Gao E, 2010, CIRC RES, V107, P1445, DOI 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.110.22392; HOLMBOM B, 1993, HISTOCHEMISTRY, V99, P265, DOI 10.1007/BF0026909; Ke Zhi-peng, 2015, Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi, V40, P99; Kolettis TM, 2013, CARDIOL REV, V21, P249, DOI 10.1097/CRD.0b013e318283f65; Mehta PK, 2015, TRENDS CARDIOVAS MED, V25, P140, DOI 10.1016/j.tcm.2014.10.00; Moran AE, 2014, GLOB HEART, V9, P3, DOI 10.1016/j.gheart.2014.03.122; Normile D, 2003, SCIENCE, V299, P188, DOI 10.1126/science.299.5604.18; O'Donnell CJ, 2011, NEW ENGL J MED, V365, P2098, DOI 10.1056/NEJMra110523; Oliver MF, 2014, LANCET, V383, P409, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60147-; RAPAPORT E, 1979, CIRCULATION, V59, P60; Reddy K, 2015, WORLD J CARDIOL, V7, P243, DOI 10.4330/wjc.v7.i5.24; Reed GW, 2017, LANCET, V389, P197, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30677-; Rogers EJ, 2011, LANCET, V377, P2175, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60952-; White HD, 2008, LANCET, V372, P570, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61237-; Wu Y., 2011, JOVE-J VIS EXP, V48, pe246; Zhang Zhen-zhen, 2015, Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi, V40, P99",27,1,1,5,14,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2018,34,3.0,,,,,765.0,771,,10.19193/0393-6384_2018_3_117,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,GJ0YH,WOS:000434980000022,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0027892561983471073,2.949512843996616e-14,0.019900393541782115,0.0821780581189035,0.019900393541782115

The virus is transmitted to people by vectors such as ticks. Despite how little is known about the disease's pathophysiology, management of the clinical period, and developments in treatment, it is known that proinflammatory parameters and cytokines are important in the pathophysiology and clinical follow-up of viral hemorrhagic diseases with fever. Among these, the number of platelets, neutrophils, and lymphocytes is important in diagnosis and clinical follow-up. There is a lot of information concerning how low platelet number is directly related to mortality and survival. Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a parameter showing platelet activation and function; therefore, it is a significant finding showing platelet maturation. For that reason, it can be claimed that platelet activation plays an important role in CCHF. Materials and methods: A total of 209 patients who were diagnosed as CCHF between May 2010 and September 2015 and whose lungs were examined during admission were retrospectively involved in the study. The patients' demographic features, clinical findings and follow-ups, laboratory findings, radiological examinations of lung, and surveys were retrospectively examined. Results: The 209 cases involved in the study consisted of 127 male (60.8%) and 82 female (39.2%) patients. Mean age was as 52 +/- 18 years. Ferritin, procalcitonin, and CRP, which are related to inflammation, were high compared to the normal reference range, too. Mean platelets and leukocytes in hemogram were 56.200/mu L +/- 44.800 and 3.070/mu L +/- 2.930, respectively. Average MPV values in nonsurvival and survival groups were 11.50 fL +/- 2.74 fL and 10.44 fL +/- 2.40 fL, respectively. Conclusions: The comparison of MPV between the survival and nonsurvival groups was found to be statistically significant (p<0.05) in CCHF. MPV can be used as a new and important clinical follow-up parameter for clinical observation of patients diagnosed with CCHF in terms of both survival and radiological findings.","[Aktas, Turan] Gaziosmanpasa Univ, Sch Med, Pulmonar Med Dept, Tokat, Turkey; [Aktas, Fatma; Ozmen, Zafer] Gaziosmanpasa Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Tokat, Turkey; [Ozmen, Cansel] Gaziosmanpasa Univ, Sch Med, Dept Clin Biochem, Tokat, Turkey; [Kaya, Turan] Tokat State Hosp, Infect & Clin Microbiol Dept, Tokat, Turkey; [Demir, Osman] Gaziosmanpasa Univ, Sch Med, Dept Stat, Tokat, Turkey","Aktas, T (corresponding author), Gaziosmanpasa Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pulm Med, Tokat, Turkey.",,,,,,"Baize S, 2002, CLIN EXP IMMUNOL, V128, P163, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2249.2002.01800.; Bancroft AJ, 2000, PLATELETS, V11, P37; Ekiz F, 2013, CLIN APPL THROMB-HEM, V19, P441, DOI 10.1177/107602961244003; Ergonul O, 2006, CLIN MICROBIOL INFEC, V12, P551, DOI 10.1111/j.1469-0691.2006.01445.; Ergonul O, 2006, LANCET INFECT DIS, V6, P203, DOI 10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70435-; Gasparyan AY, 2011, CURR PHARM DESIGN, V17, P4; Gozutok F., 2015, ACTA MED ANAT, V3, P; Inci A, 2015, J CLIN ANAL MED, V6, P1, DOI 10.4328/JCAM.227; Mardani M, 2007, ARCH IRAN MED, V10, P20; Oncu Serkan, 2013, Virologica Sinica, V28, P193, DOI 10.1007/s12250-013-3327-; Park Y, 2002, PLATELETS, V13, P301, DOI 10.1080/09537100222014833; Parlak E., 2015, JMID, V5, P5; SWANEPOEL R, 1989, REV INFECT DIS, V11, pS79; Villinger F, 1999, J INFECT DIS, V179, pS188, DOI 10.1086/51428",14,2,2,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,2.0,,,,,183.0,190,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_2_026,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2RK,WOS:000397230700001,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001446280991735537,6.792787550842174e-20,0.005109159016926122,0.07503236158157056,0.005864770831272409

Methods: Seventy-two patients with early breast cancer who admitted to our outpatient clinic were included in the study. Before and after chemotherapy, the anthropometric measurements and bioelectrical impedance analysis with TANITA device, body compositions, serum ADMA and ET-1 levels were recorded. Results: There was a statistically significant increase of serum ADMA levels (112.10 +/- 52.24 ng/ml vs. 206.34 +/- 128.02 ng/ml, p<0.001) after chemotherapy. On the other hand, the decrease of serum ET-1 levels was not statistically significant (2.19 +/- 6.65 vs. 1.68 +/- 3.71, p=0.57). ADMA levels was similar in both of the groups treated with anthracycline or anthracycline plus taxane regimens. There was no relationship between serum ADMA levels and disease stage/grade, hormone or nodal status. The changes in body composition and antropometric measurements were not statistically significant. Conclusion: The increased serum levels of ADMA could be caused by the oxidative stress, apoptosis and endothelial dysfunction secondary to chemotherapy and the decreased estrogen levels. The decrease in serum ET-1 levels might be due to the inhibition of cell proliferation and angiogenesis due to adjuvant chemotherapy.","[Akyol, Murat] Manisa State Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Manisa, Turkey;

The aim of the present study was to evaluate changes in serum levels of copper, zinc, iron, and magnesium in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and their effect on glycemic control. Sixty female patients with T2DM and seventeen healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Fasting plasma samples were obtained from the patient and control groups. Trace elements were studied using an atomic absorption spectrometer. Correlation analyses of trace elements with metabolic parameters were analyzed using Spearman's Rho correlation coefficient. T2DM patients had a significantly high fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), and microalbuminuria levels (p< 0.05). Serum magnesium levels were significantly lower in patients with T2DM compared with the healthy controls (2.0 +/- 0.2 ng/mL vs. 2.3 +/- 0.2 ng/mL, p< 0.05). Serum copper levels showed a negative correlation with diabetes duration (r= -0.338, p= 0.011), and iron levels were negatively correlated with body mass index and C-reactive protein (r= -0.407, p= 0.009; r= -0.390, p= 0.017). Serum magnesium levels indicated a correlation with HbA1C and creatinine clearance (r= -0.371, p= 0.049; r= -0.462, p= 0.023), but no significant correlation was found with any of the other variables and zinc levels. The present study found low levels of magnesium, iron, copper, and zinc in women with T2DM, which supports a close relationship of the above trace elements with glucose metabolism. Low magnesium levels has been linked to poor glycemic control in T2DM; therefore, magnesium deficiency should be prevented in patients with diabetes.","[Atalay, Hande] Gebze Fatih Govt Hosp, Internal Med Dept, Kocaeli, Turkey; [Boyuk, Banu; Altay, Murat] Gaziosmanpasa Taksim Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Istanbul, Turkey; [Guzel, Savas] Namik Kemal Univ, Dept Biochem, Tekirdag, Turkey; [Kiziler, Ali Riza] Namik Kemal Univ, Dept Biophys, Tekirdag, Turkey; [Aydemir, Birsen] Sakarya Univ, Dept Biophys, Med Fac, Adapazari, Turkey","Atalay, H (corresponding author), Gebze Fatih Govt Hosp, Internal Med Dept, Kocaeli, Turkey.",,"erman, hande/AAP-6507-2021; erman, hande/AAZ-7697-2021; Boyuk, Banu/GLN-8251-2022; BOYUK, BANU/ABA-7026-2021","erman, hande/0000-0001-7213-9624; erman, hande/0000-0001-7213-9624; Boyuk, Banu/0000-0001-7794-4411; ",,,"Bao B, 2010, AM J CLIN NUTR, V91, P1634, DOI 10.3945/ajcn.2009.2883; Barbagallo M, 2007, ARCH BIOCHEM BIOPHYS, V458, P40, DOI 10.1016/j.abb.2006.05.00; BENNETT PH, 1994, JOSLINS DIABETES MEL, P19; Canturk Z, 2003, ENDOCR RES, V29, P299, DOI 10.1081/ERC-12002503; Chutia Happy, 2015, J Lab Physicians, V7, P75, DOI 10.4103/0974-2727.16313; Cohen A M, 1986, Pancreas, V1, P309, DOI 10.1097/00006676-198607000-0000; Friederich M, 2009, CURR DIABETES REV, V5, P120, DOI 10.2174/15733990978816680; Hadjistavri LS, 2010, MED SCI MONITOR, V16, pCR30; Jansen J, 2009, J NUTR BIOCHEM, V20, P399, DOI 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2009.01.00; Kazi TG, 2008, BIOL TRACE ELEM RES, V122, P1, DOI 10.1007/s12011-007-8062-; Kelleher SL, 2011, ADV NUTR, V2, P101, DOI 10.3945/an.110.00023; Khan AR, 2014, J DIABETES METAB DIS, V13, DOI 10.1186/2251-6581-13-1; Kisters K, 2000, TRACE ELEM ELECTROLY, V17, P6; MA J, 1995, J CLIN EPIDEMIOL, V48, P927, DOI 10.1016/0895-4356(94)00200-; Makhlough A, 2015, NEPHROUROL MON, V7, DOI DOI 10.5812/NUMONTH-LY.2857; Fernandez-Real JM, 2015, DIABETES CARE, V38, P2169, DOI 10.2337/dc14-308; MCNAIR P, 1978, DIABETES, V27, P1075, DOI 10.2337/diabetes.27.11.107; Miao X, 2013, J DIABETES RES, V2013, DOI 10.1155/2013/42585; Miller JM, 2005, CLIN NEPHROL, V64, P24; MOORADIAN AD, 1994, DIABETES CARE, V17, P464, DOI 10.2337/diacare.17.5.46; NADLER JL, 1993, HYPERTENSION, V21, P1024, DOI 10.1161/01.HYP.21.6.102; NOTO R, 1983, ACTA DIABETOL LAT, V20, P81, DOI 10.1007/BF0262913; PAOLISSO G, 1986, DIABETOLOGIA, V29, P644, DOI 10.1007/BF0086926; Pham PCT, 2005, CLIN NEPHROL, V63, P42; Pham PCT, 2007, CLIN J AM SOC NEPHRO, V2, P366, DOI 10.2215/CJN.0296090; PIDDUCK HG, 1970, DIABETES, V19, P234, DOI 10.2337/diab.19.4.23; Prabodh S, 2011, BIOL TRACE ELEM RES, V142, P29, DOI 10.1007/s12011-010-8750-; Ranasinghe P, 2015, DARU, V23, DOI 10.1186/s40199-015-0127-; Sales CH, 2011, CLIN NUTR, V30, P359, DOI 10.1016/j.clnu.2010.12.01; Schulze MB, 2007, ARCH INTERN MED, V167, P956, DOI 10.1001/archinte.167.9.95; Sheu WHH, 2003, CLIN ENDOCRINOL, V58, P380, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2265.2003.01729.; Tilbrook Louise, 2004, Ann Clin Biochem, V41, P25; Viktorinova A, 2009, METABOLISM, V58, P1477, DOI 10.1016/j.metabol.2009.04.03; Vincent AM, 2004, ENDOCR REV, V25, P612, DOI 10.1210/er.2003-001; WALTER RM, 1991, DIABETES CARE, V14, P1050, DOI 10.2337/diacare.14.11.105; Walti MK, 2003, AM J CLIN NUTR, V78, P44; Zargar AH, 1998, POSTGRAD MED J, V74, P665, DOI 10.1136/pgmj.74.877.66",37,4,4,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,5.0,,,,,795.0,800,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_5_117,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FA9PC,WOS:000405777000011,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003822314049586777,8.890783154956202e-10,0.013376065931269793,0.09195140254386215,0.013376065931269793

We investigated relationship between insulin resistance and ABO/Rh blood group systems, which has not been investigated before. Material and method: In the present study, medical files of patients who applied to outpatient clinics of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Internal Medicine and Diabetes at Kayseri Training and Research Hospital between dates September 2010 and March 2015, and who had been studied for, but not diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, were retrospectively evaluated. Among patients, those with HOMA-IR >= 2.5 were accepted as having insulin resistance, and enrolled in the study. Patient whose blood groups were recorded in the hospital records or blood groups were determined later during control visits. The control group composed of healthy individuals who applied to the same hospital. Results: When compared with the control group, blood type A was significantly higher in patients with insulin resistance (p=0.022). The adjusted p value was 0.264 when Bonferroni correction was used. Blood type O group was also determined less significantly higher in patients with insulin resistance (p=0.055). The adjusted p value was 0.060. No significant difference was determined in blood types B and AB (p=0.49 and 0.12, respectively). Blood type A Rh (+) was 45.2% in patients with IR whereas 37.2% in the control group (p=0.030, adj. p=0.360). Blood type 0 Rh (+) was significantly higher in the control group (p< 0.001, adj. p< 0.001). Conclusion: These data suggest that individuals with blood type A are more directly related with insulin resistance, while those with type O are less directly related with insulin resistance in Turkish population.","[Aykas, Fatma; Kolagasi, Oykun] Antalya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Hematol, Antalya, Turkey; [Avci, Deniz; Arik, Ferhat; Cetinkaya, Ali; Ozen, Mustafa; Oguz, Arzu; Uslu, Emine] Kayseri Training & Res Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Kayseri, Turkey; [Unal, Aydin] Univ Erciyes, Dept Nephrol, Kayseri, Turkey; [Arik, Bade Erturk] Univ Erciyes, Dept Family Practice, Kayseri, Turkey","Arik, F (corresponding author), Kayseri Training & Res Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Kayseri, Turkey.",,"Oguz, Arzu/W-8004-2019","Oguz, Arzu/0000-0001-6512-6534",,,"Anstee DJ, 2010, BLOOD, V115, P4635, DOI 10.1182/blood-2010-01-26185; Bener A, 2014, NIGER J CLIN PRACT, V17, P565, DOI 10.4103/1119-3077.14141; Fagherazzi G, 2015, DIABETOLOGIA, V58, P519, DOI 10.1007/s00125-014-3472-; Franchini M, 2014, THROMB HAEMOSTASIS, V112, P1103, DOI 10.1160/TH14-05-045; Gates MA, 2011, INT J CANCER, V128, P482, DOI 10.1002/ijc.2533; Hiltunen LM, 2009, THROMB RES, V124, P167, DOI 10.1016/j.thromres.2008.11.01; HOTAMISLIGIL GS, 1995, J CLIN INVEST, V95, P2409, DOI 10.1172/JCI11793; Jassim W.

The aim of our study is to assess the occupational exposure to HBV infection, in the HCWs of the Emergency County Clinical Hospital Tirgu Mures, Romania. Materials and methods: The study was conducted retrospectively on a sample of 524 HCWs, between January 2010 and December 2014, who accidentally came into contact with blood or other body fluids from patients admitted in the Emergency County Clinical Hospital Tirgu Mures, Romania. We persuaded the source patients for the following markers: HBsAg, HCVAb and the HCWs for the following markers: HBsAg, HBsAb, HCVAb, HIVAb. Depending on the tests results and after subjects has given their consent for vaccination and counseling, vaccination was planned at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. Results: The annual rate of HBV infections occurring in health care workers ranged from 0.78% to 2.88%. The highest proportion of occupational work exposure occurred among physicians (41.6%) and nurses (32.44%). The HCWs working in surgical departments, reported the highest occupational work exposure (44.85%). The adherence to follow-up decreased significantly from the 1 month scheduled serological testing, to the 3 and 6 months testing (p< 0.0001). Conclusion: Educational programs, implementation and adherence to more safety precautions for HCWs will help to decrease the frequency of occupational work exposure. Administration of hepatitis B vaccine to HCWs early in their careers can prevent HBV infection associated with occupational work exposure.","[Bacarea, Anca; Costea, George Claudiu] Univ Med & Pharm, Dept Pathophysiol, Targu Mures, Romania; [Romila, Aurelia] Univ Dunarea de Jos, Fac Med, Dept Clin Med, 1 Vadu Sacalelor St,Bl Pescarus,Ap 8, Galati, Romania; [Romila, Aurelia] Galati Cty Hosp, Clin Geriatr Dept, Targu Mures, Romania; [Petrisor, Dana Valentina; Bacarea, Vladimir] Univ Med & Pharm, Med Res Methodol Dept, Targu Mures, Romania; [Bui, Lucia] Emergency Cty Hosp, Surveillance & Control Nosocomial Infect Dept, Targu Mures, Romania","Romila, A (corresponding author), Univ Dunarea de Jos, Fac Med, Dept Clin Med, 1 Vadu Sacalelor St,Bl Pescarus,Ap 8, Galati, Romania.",,"Bacarea, Anca/AAW-9459-2020",,,,"[Anonymous], 2011, COUNTRY MISSION ROM; Batra V, 2015, ANN GASTROENTEROL, V28, P27; Blachier M, 2013, J HEPATOL, V58, P593, DOI 10.1016/j.jhep.2012.12.00; Butsashvili M, 2012, OCCUP MED-OXFORD, V62, P620, DOI 10.1093/occmed/kqs12; Coppola N, 2016, WORLD J HEPATOL, V8, P273, DOI 10.4254/wjh.v8.i5.27; Dement JM, 2004, AM J IND MED, V46, P637, DOI 10.1002/ajim.2010; Gheorghe L, 2013, EUR J GASTROEN HEPAT, V25, P56, DOI 10.1097/MEG.0b013e328358b0b; Homoud AHA, 2014, J INFECT PUBLIC HEAL, V7, P257, DOI 10.1016/j.jiph.2013.08.00; Lok ASF, 2007, HEPATOLOGY, V45, P507, DOI 10.1002/hep.2151; Lozano R, 2012, LANCET, V380, P2095, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-; Marcellin P, 2009, J HEPATOL, V50, P227, DOI 10.1016/j.jhep.2008.10.00; Markovc-Denic L, 2013, SRP ARK CELOK LEK, V141, P789, DOI 10.2298/SARH1312789; McMahon BJ, 2005, SEMIN LIVER DIS, V25, P3, DOI 10.1055/s-2005-91564; Minuk G Y, 2005, HPB (Oxford), V7, P56, DOI 10.1080/1365182041001663; Nardone A, 2009, EPIDEMIOL INFECT, V137, P961, DOI 10.1017/S095026880800167; Rice BD, 2015, OCCUP MED-OXFORD, V65, P210, DOI 10.1093/occmed/kqu20; Schillie S, 2013, MMWR RECOMM REP, V62, P; Vieira D, 2015, ANN OCCUP HYG, V59, P566, DOI 10.1093/annhyg/meu11",18,1,1,1,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,1.0,,,,,17.0,21,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1_002,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2PY,WOS:000397226800002,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001859504132231405,1.1671425118699838e-11,0.00559743417987367,0.10344864437391128,0.005575929485236409

MicroRNA (miRNA) dysregulation in HCC results in inhibition of cellular apoptosis, increased angiogenesis, invasion and development of metastasis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of serum miRNA-26, miRNA-122 and miRNA-192 levels in diagnosis of HCC compared to other prognostic criteria. Materials and methods: The study included newly diagnosed HCC patients (n=42) and patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as controls (n=45). We measured serum miRNA-26, miRNA-122 and miRNA-192 levels for each patient. Results: Serum levels of miRNA-26 were significantly lower in HCC patients (29.03) than those in control group (30.34) (p<0.001). There was no significant difference in serum levels of miRNA-122 between the two groups (p=0.181). MiRNA-192 was not expressed as assessed by the real-time PCR method. For diagnosis of HCC, cut-off value was set at 29.38 for miR-26. With this cut-off value, sensitivity was 71.4%, and specificity was 82.2%, while positive and negative predictive values were 78.9% and 75.5%, respectively (p<0.0001). We also compared the miRNA-26 and miRNA-122 levels of patients with other diagnostic, clinical and prognostic data, which are significant for HCC. No statistically significant correlation was found between alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and miRNA122 and miRNA-26 gene expressions. Conclusions: Serum levels of miRNA-26 may contribute to early diagnosis of HCC when used together with other diagnostic, clinical and prognostic markers.","[Balkan, Ayhan; Guelsen, Murat Taner] Gazi Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Gaziantep TR-27310, Turkey; [Kaya, Buenyamin] Gazi Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Gaziantep TR-27310, Turkey","Balkan, A (corresponding author), Gazi Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Gaziantep TR-27310, Turkey.",,,,Scientific Research Fund by Gaziantep University [BAP- TF.UT.16.07],All authors thank to Scientific Research Fund by Gaziantep University for their financial support (Project no.

In this study, the researchers reflected on the GCSF's effects on different organs in pregnant mice. Then, using safe doses for mother and fetus, it was applied either as a growing stimulator or a neutralizer factor for negative effects of such teratogenicity drugs as Phenobarbital. Using Phenobarbital during pregnancy can increase the possibility of abnormalities in infants like cleft palate, heart abnormalities and weight reduction in birthday. The purpose of this research is Studying the possible protective effect of GCSF against teratogenic effects of Phenobarbital in mice fetus. Method: 120 mg/kg of Phenobarbital within GCSF in different doses was injected to the mice on 9th day of gestation. Their fetuses were then brought out of uterus on 15th day of gestation and were examined by microscopic and macroscopic methods. Findings: Although it was observed that 1.63 mu g/mL of GCSF amended the cleft palate in mice fetus (P<0.05), other doses of GCSF (3.25, 7.75, 12, 15 mu g/mL) yielded no difference in the cleft palate occurrence or its amendment in mice fetus. Results: The results of the present study showed that GCSF may have the teratogenicity effects of Phenobarbital in cleft palate and will prevent its occurrence.","[Bovand, Tannaz; Mousavi, Zahra] Islamic Azad Univ, Pharmaceut Sci Branch, Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol,IAUPS, Tehran, Iran; [Vatanpour, Hossein] Med Sci Univ Shahid Beheshti, Sch Pharm, Toxicol & Pharmacol Dept, Tehran, Iran","Vatanpour, H (corresponding author), Med Sci Univ Shahid Beheshti, Sch Pharm, Toxicol & Pharmacol Dept, Tehran, Iran.",,"Mousavi, Zahra/AAO-3117-2021","Mousavi, Zahra/0000-0001-6524-491X","Toxicology and Pharmacology Lab., School of Pharmacy, Medical Science University of Shahid Beheshti, Tehran, Iran","The authors thank the Toxicology and Pharmacology Lab., School of Pharmacy, Medical Science University of Shahid Beheshti, Tehran, Iran for supporting this project.

Participants performed a deep squat test three times according to Cook's guidelines for Functional Movement Screening. They get scored by a clinician as 1, 2 or 3. During the test performance, 3D angular kinematic data was collected by 8 high speed Oqus 7+ cameras which were connected directly to the computer. Left and right knee, hip and shoulder angles; trunk flexion angle; hip, calf segmental angles, dowel angle in frontal axis; and also thigh segmental angle in horizontal axis were assessed to examine differences between the three scoring groups by using Qualisys Track Manager (QTM) Version 2.12. SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) program was used for the differences by Kruskal Wallis test. As a result of the study, the significant difference were found at right and left knee angle between groups (p<0.05). Also in horizontal plane, right and left thigh were significantly difference between groups (p<0.05) too. There were no significant differences found in other parameters. (p>0.05). As a conclusion, in squat movement, as the limitation of motion increases, the hip and knee angles were getting higher and because there was a knee excursion in the horizantal plane, the mechanics of movement distorted.","[Bulgan, Cigdem] Halic Univ, Sch Phys Educ & Sports, TSYD Campus,Levent Cad 51, TR-34350 Istanbul, Turkey","Bulgan, C (corresponding author), Halic Univ, Sch Phys Educ & Sports, TSYD Campus,Levent Cad 51, TR-34350 Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Bulgan, Cigdem/AAH-3432-2020",,,,"Beach TAC, 2014, APPL ERGON, V45, P482, DOI 10.1016/j.apergo.2013.06.00; Bushman TT, 2015, J STRENGTH COND RES, V29, pS65, DOI 10.1519/JSC.000000000000104; Butler RJ, 2010, SPORT BIOMECH, V9, P270, DOI 10.1080/14763141.2010.53962; Chorba Rita S, 2010, N Am J Sports Phys Ther, V5, P4; Clifton DR, 2013, J STRENGTH COND RES, V27, P966, DOI 10.1519/JSC.0b013e318260b72; Conlon JK, 2013, THESI; Cook G, FUNCTIONAL MOVEMEN; Cook G., 2010, MOVEMENT FUNCTIONAL, VFirs; Cook Gray, 2006, N Am J Sports Phys Ther, V1, P6; Duncan MJ, 2013, BMC SPORTS SCI MED R, V5, DOI 10.1186/2052-1847-5-1; El-Tohamy AM, 2016, TRENDS APPL SCI RES, V11, P19, DOI DOI 10.3923/tasr.2016.19.2; Escamilla RF, 2001, MED SCI SPORT EXER, V33, P984, DOI 10.1097/00005768-200106000-0001; Fernandez WG, 2007, ACAD EMERG MED, V14, P641, DOI 10.1111/j.1553-2712.2007.tb01851.; Fox D, 2014, PHYS THER SPORT, V15, P194, DOI 10.1016/j.ptsp.2013.11.00; Frost DM, 2012, J STRENGTH COND RES, V26, P1620, DOI 10.1519/JSC.0b013e318234ec5; Hemmerich A, 2006, J ORTHOP RES, V24, P770, DOI 10.1002/jor.2011; Kiesel K, 2011, SCAND J MED SCI SPOR, V21, P287, DOI 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2009.01038.; Koehle MS, 2016, J STRENGTH COND RES, V30, P540, DOI 10.1519/JSC.000000000000109; Krause DA, 2015, INT J SPORTS PHYS TH, V10, P3; Liao T, 2017, APPL FUNCTIONAL MOVE, P18; Lockie RG, 2015, BIOL SPORT, V32, P41, DOI 10.5604/20831862.112728; McCunn R, 2016, SPORTS MED, V46, P763, DOI 10.1007/s40279-015-0453-; McMillian DJ, 2016, J STRENGTH COND RES, V30, P973, DOI 10.1519/JSC.000000000000119; Mills JD, 2005, PHYS THER SPORT, V6, P60, DOI 10.1016/j.ptsp.2005.02.00; Minick KI, 2010, J STRENGTH COND RES, V24, P479, DOI 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181c09c0; Okada T, 2011, J STRENGTH COND RES, V25, P252, DOI 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181b22b3; Paoli A, 2015, CLIN PHYSIOL FUNCT I, V35, P1, DOI 10.1111/cpf.1213; Parenteau E, 2014, PHYS THER SPORT, V15, P169, DOI 10.1016/j.ptsp.2013.10.00; Shultz R, 2013, J ATHL TRAINING, V48, P331, DOI 10.4085/1062-6050-48.2.1; Waldron M, 2016, J STRENGTH COND RES, V30, P910, DOI 10.1519/JSC.000000000000027",30,1,1,1,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,651.0,656,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_097,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700018,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0030991735537190084,7.210303698028254e-11,0.005983068908662273,0.1002537413909171,0.005983068908662273

These diseases cause cytokine storm and trigger extreme hyperferritinemia, thus they are called hyperferritinemic syndromes. Case presentation: We present a case of a 55-year-old female who had fever, rash and arthralgia. She was admitted to the Hospital of Infectious Diseases in Warsaw with SIRS initially attributed to bacterial infection and suspicion of sepsis. During diagnostic management the patient developed overwhelming SIRS with hyperferritinemia. Broad-spectral antibiotics with short course of steroids were administered for the suspected autoimmunological syndrome. The response to treatment was quick. None syndromes met diagnostic criteria. After vancomycin infusion the second exacerbation appeared with acute kidney injury. Methylprednisolone pulses provided improvement. The patient met HLH criteria a few days after the second exacerbation. Slow, complete remission was achieved with immunosuppressive therapy (steroids and methotrexate). MAS was recognized due to AOSD. Conclusion: The clinical presentation of patients with SIRS is nonspecific. They require thorough assessment because similar symptoms may occur in other several non-infectious conditions, such as autoimmune or hematological disorders.","[Bursa, Dominik; Paciorek, Marcin; Porowski, Dawid; Bednarska, Agnieszka] Med Univ Warsaw, Dept Adults Infect Dis, Warsaw, Poland; [Bursa, Dominik; Paciorek, Marcin; Porowski, Dawid; Bednarska, Agnieszka] Hosp Infect Dis, Warsaw, Poland","Bursa, D (corresponding author), 7-6 Lecha St, PL-05400 Otwock, Poland.",,,,"Research Development Foundation in Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Warsaw, Poland","Paper is partially supported by Research Development Foundation in Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Warsaw, Poland","Cooper GS, 2009, J AUTOIMMUN, V33, P197, DOI 10.1016/j.jaut.2009.09.00; Deane S, 2010, INT ARCH ALLERGY IMM, V153, P109, DOI 10.1159/00031262; Dellinger RP, 2013, INTENS CARE MED, V39, P165, DOI [10.1097/CCM.0b013e31827e83af, 10.1007/s00134-012-2769-8; Efthimiou P, 2014, CLIN RHEUMATOL, V33, P305, DOI 10.1007/s10067-014-2487-; Gerfaud-Valentin M, 2014, AUTOIMMUN REV, V13, P708, DOI 10.1016/j.autrev.2014.01.05; Henter JI, 2007, PEDIATR BLOOD CANCER, V48, P124, DOI 10.1002/pbc.2103; Janka GE, 2012, ANNU REV MED, V63, P233, DOI 10.1146/annurev-med-041610-13420; Janka GE, 2007, BLOOD REV, V21, P245, DOI 10.1016/j.blre.2007.05.00; Olgar S, 2007, J RHEUMATOL, V34, P249; Raschke RA, 2011, CHEST, V140, P933, DOI 10.1378/chest.11-061; Rosado FGN, 2013, AM J CLIN PATHOL, V139, P713, DOI 10.1309/AJCP4ZDKJ4ICOUA; Rosario C, 2013, BMC MED, V11, DOI 10.1186/1741-7015-11-18; YAMAGUCHI M, 1992, J RHEUMATOL, V19, P42",13,1,1,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,569.0,573,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_083,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700004,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0013429752066115702,1.812061143085346e-17,0.0024779299821800454,0.08133291882672224,0.0024779299821800454

To create a healthy generation and for health promotion, obesity must be more emphasised among healthcare providers and policy makers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency, awareness and self-management of obesity among healthcare providers. This study also evaluated whether sociodemographic factors influence obesity and obesity awareness and management among the participants. Material and methods: The study was cross-sectional; the research was conducted with 493 healthcare providers. The study group ranged in age from 18-57 years. The survey questions were prepared using the World Health Organisation (WHO) STEP wise approach to noncommunicable disease risk factor surveillance. Results: The frequency of obesity among healthcare providers was 14.9%. Obesity risks were 3.361 fold (95% CI, 1.996-5.727) higher in older age groups than younger. There was no significant relationship identified between obesity and gender. A relatively low educational level meant a 2.688-fold (95% CI, 1.590-4.546) increase in the risk of obesity. The obesity rate was significantly higher in married participants and significantly lower in childless participants. The frequency of obesity by occupation was 16% for doctors, 1% for nurses, 13% for permanent medical staff, and 22% for medical information technology staff. A higher rate of eating a regular balanced diet was observed in doctors. It was observed that cigarette smoking increased the risk of obesity 1.852-fold (95% CI, 1.282.2.973). Conclusion: Although obesity awareness was low among all healthcare providers, the frequency of obesity was lower than the general population in this study group.","[Cakmur, Hulya] Kafkas Univ, Sch Med, Dept Family Med, Kars, Turkey; [Anuk, Turgut] Kafkas Univ, Dept Gen Surg, Sch Med, Kars, Turkey","Cakmur, H (corresponding author), Kafkas Univ, Sch Med, Dept Family Med, Kars, Turkey.",,,,,,"[Anonymous], 2016, WHO STEP WISE APPRO; Cakmur H., 2017, ADIPOSITY EPIDEMIOLO, P1; Dombrowski SU, 2010, OBESITY FACTS, V3, P377, DOI 10.1159/00032307; Florez KR, 2015, J ACAD NUTR DIET, V115, P1102, DOI 10.1016/j.jand.2015.01.00; Garaulet M, 2010, INT J OBESITY, V34, P1667, DOI 10.1038/ijo.2010.11; Haslam DW, 2005, LANCET, V366, P1197, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67483-; Iwuala SO, 2015, PAN AFR MED J, V22, DOI 10.11604/pamj.2015.22.1.558; Katz Sara, 2005, BMC Med Educ, V5, P4, DOI 10.1186/1472-6920-5-; Kyle RG, 2016, INT J NURS STUD, V53, P126, DOI 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2015.10.01; Makowske M, 2005, NUTR J, V4, DOI 10.1186/1475-2891-4-; Metcalf B, 2005, OBES SURG, V15, P183, DOI 10.1381/096089205326838; Mokdad AH, 2003, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V289, P76, DOI 10.1001/jama.289.1.7; Oguz A, 2008, TURK KARDIYOL DERN A, V36, P30; Paoli A, 2015, CLIN PHYSIOL FUNCT I, V35, P1, DOI 10.1111/cpf.1213; Rurik I, 2013, BMC FAM PRACT, V14, DOI 10.1186/1471-2296-14-15; Satman I, 2002, TURDEP GROUP D CARE, V25, P155; Thaikruea L, 2016, PREVALENCE NORMAL W; TurkStat, 2016, STAT DE; While AE, 2015, LONDON J PRIM CARE, V7, P112, DOI 10.1080/17571472.2015.111371; Willis LH, 2012, J APPL PHYSIOL, V113, P1831, DOI 10.1152/japplphysiol.01370.201; Withrow D, 2011, OBES REV, V12, P131, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2009.00712.; Wolf AM, 2008, DIABETES OBES METAB, V10, P1248, DOI 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2008.00895.; Wolin KY, 2009, OBESIT; World Health Organization, GLOB STRAT DIET PHY; World Health Organization Expert Committee on Physical Status, 1995, WHO TECHN SUPP SER, V85; Zhu DQ, 2011, OBES REV, V12, P459, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2010.00821.",26,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,1073.0,1079,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_170,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500029,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0026859504132231405,2.1710797547791434e-08,0.006461247256522966,0.10483338206786012,0.006198847530169745

Material and methods: Participants of this study consisted of 101 men and 97 women with the total of 198 people (X age = 29.68 +/- 9.79) who volunteered for the study. Leisure satisfaction was measured with Leisure Satisfaction Scale (LSS) developed by Beard and Raghed (1980) and the Turkish validity and reliability of the scale was measured by Karli et al. (2008). Additionally a  personal information form was adopted in order to collect data concerning the demographic information and outdoor recreation participation of the sample. Independent samples t test was used to determine the differences of leisure satisfaction levels of participants according to their active or passive participation in these activities. Results: According to the findings, significant differences were obtained in leisure satisfaction scores (total(3.723)= 196, p= 0.000) and in four sub-dimensions of the scale which were Psychological (t1(4.191)= 196, p= 0.000), Educational (t2(2,373)= 159.7, p= 0.019), Relaxing (t3(2.852)= 196, p= 0.005) and Physiological (t4(4.442)= 196, p= 0.000) according to active or passive participation in outdoor recreation activities. Conclusion: In conclusion, the findings of this study present that leisure satisfaction scores are affected by active and passive participation in outdoor recreation activities. As a result, the findings of this study demonstrate that leisure satisfaction differs according to active/passive participation in outdoor activities. Participating in outdoor activities in an active manner may enhance individuals' levels of leisure satisfaction.","[Cetinkaya, Guney; Sahin, F.

Indeed, many studies have suggested that among powerful pre-carcinogens involved in breast carcinogenesis derived from aromatic and heterocyclic amines. These are either directly detoxified or converted into carcinogens by N-acetyltransferases-1 and 2. Both highly polymorphic isoenzymes are involved in the increased susceptibility to breast cancer. The objective of our work was to examine the effects of N-acetyltransferase 1*15 (NAT1*15) polymorphism and its relationship with red meat consumption and cigarettes smoking, on breast cancer risk. Materiel and methods: The C and T alleles were identified by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis for 60 Algerian patients with BC and 60 women controls. Results: There was no association between NAT1*15 polymorphisms and Breast cancer. However, the red meat intake increased susceptibility to the disease (p=0.017, OR=5.537). Conclusion: Our results suggest that NAT1* 15 polymorphisms would not be involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. However, the red meat intake would be a risk factor for breast cancer in our population. This risk can be attributed to the high fat contained in the red meat.","[Chelouti, Hiba; Khelil, Malika] Univ Sci & Technol Houari Boumed, Fac Sci Biol, Dept Biol Cellulaire & Mol, BP 32 El Alia, Algiers 16111, Algeria; [Bouzid, Kamel] CHU Mustapha Bacha, Ctr Pierre & Marie Curie, Serv Oncol, Algiers, Algeria","Khelil, M (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol Houari Boumed, Fac Sci Biol, Dept Biol Cellulaire & Mol, BP 32 El Alia, Algiers 16111, Algeria.",,,,,,"Boukouvala S, 2005, DRUG METAB REV, V37, P511, DOI 10.1080/0360253050025120; Bruhn C, 1999, BIOCHEM PHARMACOL, V58, P1759, DOI 10.1016/S0006-2952(99)00269-; Cho EY, 2006, ARCH INTERN MED, V166, P2253, DOI 10.1001/archinte.166.20.225; Deitz AC, 1997, ANAL BIOCHEM, V253, P219, DOI 10.1006/abio.1997.237; Felton JS, 2002, ENVIRON MOL MUTAGEN, V39, P112, DOI 10.1002/em.1007; Gammon MD, 2004, ENVIRON RES, V96, P176, DOI 10.1016/j.envres.2003.08.00; Gaudet MM, 2013, JNCI-J NATL CANCER I, V105, P515, DOI 10.1093/jnci/djt02; GOODMAN MT, 1992, CANCER EPIDEM BIOMAR, V1, P26; Grant DM, 1997, MUTAT RES-FUND MOL M, V376, P61, DOI 10.1016/S0027-5107(97)00026-; Hein DW, 2002, MUTAT RES-FUND MOL M, V506, P65, DOI 10.1016/S0027-5107(02)00153-; Hein DW, 2006, MOL CARCINOGEN, V45, P230, DOI 10.1002/mc.2016; HEIN DW, 1988, BIOCHIM BIOPHYS ACTA, V948, P37, DOI 10.1016/0304-419X(88)90004-; Hirvonen A, 1999, IARC Sci Publ, P25; Hughes NC, 1998, PHARMACOGENETICS, V8, P55, DOI 10.1097/00008571-199802000-0000; LAYTON DW, 1995, CARCINOGENESIS, V16, P39, DOI 10.1093/carcin/16.1.3; MATOS EL, 1991, NEOPLASMA, V38, P35; Meyer UA, 1997, ANNU REV PHARMACOL, V37, P269, DOI 10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.37.1.26; Miller SA, 1988, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V16, P883, DOI [DOI 10.1093/NAR/16.3.1215, 10.1093/nar/16.3.1215; Millikan RC, 1998, CANCER EPIDEM BIOMAR, V7, P37; NAGAO M, 1994, CANCER, V74, P1063, DOI 10.1002/1097-0142(19940801)74:3+<1063::AID-CNCR2820741514>3.0.CO;2-; PALMER JR, 1993, EPIDEMIOL REV, V15, P145, DOI 10.1093/oxfordjournals.epirev.a03609; Shirai T, 1995, Princess Takamatsu Symp, V23, P23; VATSIS KP, 1993, ARCH BIOCHEM BIOPHYS, V301, P71, DOI 10.1006/abbi.1993.111; VATSIS KP, 1995, PHARMACOGENETICS, V5, P1, DOI 10.1097/00008571-199502000-0000; WEBER WW, 1985, PHARMACOL REV, V37, P2; Xue F, 2011, ARCH INTERN MED, V171, P125, DOI 10.1001/archinternmed.2010.50; Zheng W, 1998, JNCI-J NATL CANCER I, V90, P1724, DOI 10.1093/jnci/90.22.172; Zheng W, 1999, CANCER EPIDEM BIOMAR, V8, P23; Zhu Y, 2008, PHARMACOGENOMICS J, V8, P339, DOI 10.1038/sj.tpj.650048",29,1,1,1,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,1.0,,,,,89.0,93,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1_014,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2PY,WOS:000397226800014,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0030991735537190084,1.876335469756682e-08,0.005983068908662273,0.1277769711049804,0.005983068908662273

Experimental investigations have, however, highlighted the existence of a fetal memory, as the fetus would seem to be able to memorize and learn prematurely. However, these are unconscious memories, which are not easily retrievable and expressible. The purpose of this study was to verify whether and how pregnancy and birth patterns affect the lifestyle of an adult subject. 50 volunteer students of the Degree Course in Psychological Sciences and Techniques of the University of Catania took part in the research. The sample was subjected to the regression technique, and then a nine-question questionnaire was given out to be filled in anonymously. Only 15 out of 50 subjects returned it completed. The results obtained have shown how the experience of rebirth influences the quality of present life. One observes how the experience of regression is significantly correlated with the perception of one's self and how subjects can retrieve memories of unconscious feelings that experience has led them to live, which may partly account for one's personality.","[Coco, Marinella; Buscemi, Barbara; Buscemi, Andrea] Horus Cooperat Social, Ragusa, Italy; [Ramaci, Tiziana] Univ Kore, Enna, Italy; [Sagone, Elisabetta; Perciavalle, Valentina] Univ Catania, Dept Educ Sci, Catania, Italy; [Sardo, Milena Galati; Brachina, Paola; Coco, Lucio Salvatore Giovanni; Papotto, Giacomo; Papotto, Giulio Maria Federico; Di Gregorio, Giulia] Univ Catania, Catania, Italy; [Petralia, Maria Cristina] Univ Catania, Dept Biomed & Biotechnol Sci, Catania, Italy","Coco, M (corresponding author), Horus Cooperat Social, Ragusa, Italy.",marinella.coco@gmail.com,"Coco, Marinella/AAC-8750-2020; papotto, giacomo/AAP-3068-2021; RAMACI, TIZIANA/AAD-3672-2019; Sagone, Elisabetta/AAC-1483-2022; Petralia, Maria/AAE-6337-2019","papotto, giacomo/0000-0001-8103-8075; RAMACI, TIZIANA/0000-0002-0745-2013; Petralia, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-9643-1045; SAGONE, Elisabetta/0000-0001-5283-4603",,,"Buscemi A, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P953, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_11; Caraci F, 2014, CNS NEUROL DISORD-DR, V13, P173, DOI 10.2174/1871527311312999010; Castellano S, 2015, CLIN GERONTOLOGIST, V38, P103, DOI 10.1080/07317115.2014.99059; Chamberlain D., 1998, BAMBINI RICORDANO N; Conel JL, 1939, POSTNATAL DEV HUMA; De Pasquale C, 2016, WORLD J TRANSPLANT, V24, P73; De Pasquale C, 2016, ANN GEN PSYCHIATR, P1; FALIN LI, 1961, ACTA ANAT, V44, P18; Friedhoff AJ, PRENATAL NEUROTRANSM, P51; Garcia D, 2017, PEERJ, V5, DOI 10.7717/peerj.286; HUTTUNEN MO, 1978, ARCH GEN PSYCHIAT, V35, P42; Imbasciati A., 1998, NASCITA COSTRUZION; Kershman J., 1939, ARCH NEUROL PSYCHIA; Lagercrantz H, 2002, NEWBORN BRAIN: NEUROSCIENCE AND CLINICAL APPLICATIONS, P13; Musumeci G, 2012, ACTA HISTOCHEM, V114, P805, DOI 10.1016/j.acthis.2012.02.00; Musumeci G, 2012, KNEE SURG SPORT TR A, V20, P216, DOI 10.1007/s00167-011-1630-; Pellerone M, 2017, CLIN NEUROPSYCHIATR, V14, P14; Pellerone M, 2017, PSYCHOL RES BEHAV MA, V10, P69, DOI 10.2147/PRBM.S12831; Perciavalle V, 2016, PHYSICIAN SPORTSMED, V44, P403, DOI 10.1080/00913847.2016.122285; Sagone E, 2013, PROCD SOC BEHV, V82, P131, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.06.23; Santisi G, 2014, PROCD SOC BEHV, V116, P1227, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.01.37; Specchiale A, 2013, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V29, P40; Ulfig N, 2003, ANN NY ACAD SCI, V985, P2",23,4,4,0,8,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,901.0,904,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_143,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500002,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0023760330578512395,1.3504549278720877e-17,0.004335185184789882,0.05552528178506898,0.004334931903603125

In this study, specific causes of athletes' knee fracture and ligament injury were explored, the application of emergency CT examination in taekwondo athletes' knee fracture and ligament injury was analyzed through a specific examination method, in order to verify the practical value of emergency CT examination in the clinic. 1400 taekwondo athletes with knee fracture and ligament injury were randomly selected as subjects, clinical data were retrospectively analyzed, with patients' X-ray examination results, clinical and surgical results compared. Results showed that 1,000 out of 1,400 patients had fracture. 1200 cases (why 1200 ? only 1000 had fracture ?) of knee fracture were diagnosed by CT examination, with 10 false negative cases; 500 cases of fracture were detected by X-ray examination, 900 cases of ligament injury were diagnosed by CT examination with 50 false negative cases; 170 cases of medial collateral ligament injury were determined by X-ray with indirect signs. Based on the above findings we can conclude that CT examination had advantages when compared to X-ray examination, as it was more sensitive than X-ray examination in incomplete ligament injury diagnosis. For the diagnosis of complete laceration of ligament, X-ray examination should be combined with clinical data to obtain a more accurate diagnosis.","[Cui, Hao] DaLian Maritime Univ, Dept Phys Educ, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China","Cui, H (corresponding author), DaLian Maritime Univ, Dept Phys Educ, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China.",haocui2016@126.com,,,,,"Cantarella G, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P101; Gao W, 2017, SAUDI PHARM J, V25, P580, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2017.04.02; Ge S, 2016, SAUDI JOURNAL OF BI; Khan M, 2017, ARAB J CHEM, V10, P708, DOI 10.1016/j.arabjc.2017.01.00; Li Chengming, 2011, CONT MED, V14, P11; Olya M.

Material and methods: The present study retrospectively evaluated axial and coronal 1 mm thick CT scans of paranasal sinuses in 1502 cases. The patients without aeration of the frontal bone and ethmoidal cells above the supraorbital margin (horizontal line) and patients without aerated cells extending beyond the medial wall of the orbit (vertical line) were considered to have frontal sinus aplasia Results: Of 1502 patients with an age range between 16 and 73 years, 819 were females and 683 were males. Of these patients, 42 (0.27%) had bilateral frontal sinus aplasia and 53 (0.35%) had unilateral frontal sinus aplasia. Only two patients had sphenoid sinus aplasia and one patient had maxillary sinus aplasia. Conclusion: Paranasal sinuses represent great structural variations. Fractures, mucocele, primary ciliary dyskinesia, infections, and some syndromes may affect the development of PNSs. Aplasia of PNSs can point to clinically significant diseases and it must be kept in mind and explored during planning for surgical intervention to the sinuses in order to prevent complications. Computed tomography is a useful method in delineating a detailed anatomy of PNSs and detecting anomalies and pathological conditions.","[Duzer, Sertac; Sakallioglu, Oner; Akyigit, Abdulvahap; Polat, Cahit; Cetiner, Hasan] Elazig Training & Res Hosp, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, TR-23200 Elazig, Turkey; [Aydemir, Yavuz] Elazig Training & Res Hosp, Dept Radiol, Elazig, Turkey","Duzer, S (corresponding author), Elazig Training & Res Hosp, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, TR-23200 Elazig, Turkey.",,"CETINER, HASAN/AAQ-6824-2020; DUZER, SERTAC/AAK-1078-2020; Akyigit, Abdulvahap/W-2984-2018","DUZER, SERTAC/0000-0003-2988-6223; Akyigit, Abdulvahap/0000-0002-2192-155X; POLAT, CAHIT/0000-0001-9838-6906",,,"Anik I, 2005, CLIN ANAT, V18, P217, DOI 10.1002/ca.2009; Antoniades K, 1996, ORL J OTO-RHINO-LARY, V58, P347, DOI 10.1159/00027686; Aydinlioglu A, 2004, CLIN ANAT, V17, P618, DOI 10.1002/ca.2002; Aydmlioglu A, 2003, YONSEI MED J, V44, P21; Baykara M., 2002, TURK J MED SCI, V32, P27; Cakur Binali, 2011, Int J Med Sci, V8, P27; Choudhary S, 2015, INT J ANAT RES, V3, P1620, DOI [10.16965/ijar.2015.237, DOI 10.16965/IJAR.2015.237; Eggesbo HB, 2001, ACTA RADIOL, V42, P482, DOI 10.1080/02841850112734721; HANSON CL, 1980, AM J PHYS ANTHROPOL, V53, P251, DOI 10.1002/ajpa.133053020; Jafari-Pozve Nasim, 2014, Dent Res J (Isfahan), V11, P61; Keskin G, 2002, SURG RADIOL ANAT, V24, P324, DOI 10.1007/s00276-002-0028-; Khanduri S, 2015, INDIAN J OTOLARYNGOL, V67, P434, DOI 10.1007/s12070-015-0877-; Korkmaz H, 2013, ALLERGY RHINOL, V4, pE105, DOI 10.2500/ar.2013.4.005; Martines F, 2016, BRAZ J OTORHINOLAR, V82, P215, DOI 10.1016/j.bjorl.2015.04.00; Martines Francesco, 2014, J Med Case Rep, V8, P282, DOI 10.1186/1752-1947-8-28; Pifferi M, 2011, EUR RESPIR J, V37, P566, DOI 10.1183/09031936.0006881; Pifferi M, 2009, THORAX, V64, P1077, DOI 10.1136/thx.2008.11094; REICHS KJ, 1993, FORENSIC SCI INT, V61, P141, DOI 10.1016/0379-0738(93)90222-; Ribeiro F de A, 2000, Ear Nose Throat J, V79, P2; Som PM, 2003, ANATOMY PHYSL, P9; Sonbay D, 2010, B-ENT, V6, P16; Thiagarajan B, 2012, ONLINE J OTOLARYNGOL, V; Vitali M, 2017, J NEUROSURG SCI, DOI 10.23736/S0390-5616.17.03987-; White SC., 2009, ORAL RADIOL, V6th ed, P52",24,3,3,1,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,637.0,640,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_094,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700015,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0024793388429752063,6.720318133035959e-27,0.004600411679085511,0.05739323257896016,0.00459183701786009

Materials and methods: The study group consisted of 40 patients with bipolar type schizoaffective disorder as defined by DSM-IV criteria and 39 healthy control subjects. IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-alpha and hsCRP serum levels were examined by ELISA. Their clinical symptoms were rated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale. Univariate analysis of covariance controlled for possible confounders was used to compare cytokines and hsCRP levels among the groups. Results: hsCRP levels were significantly higher in patients compared to controls and IL-4 levels were significantly lower in patients compared to controls. hsCRP levels were significantly higher during the depressive phase, and IL-4 levels were significantly lower during the manic phase in patients compared to controls. No statistically significant differences were found in IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha. Conclusion: The results suggest that inflammatory dysregulation is associated with the schizoaffective disorder, and these changes may be related to affective phases of the bipolar type schizoaffective disorder.","[Elboga, Gulcin; Altindag, Abdurrahman] Gaziantep Univ, Med Fac, Dept Psychiat, Sahinbey, Gaziantep, Turkey; [Sahin, Sengul Kocamer] Adana State Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Adana, Turkey; [Sahin, Ahmet Ziya] Adana Askim Tufekei State Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Adana, Turkey","Elboga, G (corresponding author), Gaziantep Univ, Med Fac, Dept Psychiat, Sahinbey, Gaziantep, Turkey.",,"Sahin, Ahmet Ziyaettin/AAI-1994-2021; Elboga, Gulcin/AAG-6587-2020; Şahin, Ahmet Ziyaettin/A-8069-2012; Şahin, Şengül/AAI-2398-2019; Altindag, Abdurrahman/AAG-6463-2020","Sahin, Ahmet Ziyaettin/0000-0003-1060-6746; Şahin, Ahmet Ziyaettin/0000-0003-1060-6746; Şahin, Şengül/0000-0002-5371-3907; Altindag, Abdurrahman/0000-0001-5531-4419",Gaziantep University Scientific Research Project Department [TF.12.32],Gaziantep University Scientific Research Project Department supports this study.

The patients who restrict dietary sodium intake have better cardiovascular outcomes and quality of life. The purpose of this study was to assess dietary knowledge of patients about dietary sodium and medical complications of noncompliance. Materials and methods: An interviewer-administered questionnaire about knowledge of dietary sodium, and medical complications of dietary noncompliance was applied to hemodialysis patients. Results: Although 85.3% of patients reported that high sodium intake was associated with high blood pressure, interdialytic weight gain were more than 5.7% in 81.6% of patients. There was no statistically significant difference between genders, educational, and economic status of patients and interdialytic weight gain. Overall knowledge scores were poor, moderate, and high in 16%, 56%, and 28% of patients, respectively. The awareness score of risks of noncompliance was high in only 24% of patients. The knowledge scores showed significant weak positive correlation with educational level (spearman's rho (rs)=0.17, p=0.03). There was no correlation with knowledge levels and interdialytic weight gains (rs=-0.13, p=0.11). The awareness did not differ with educational level, and age (rs=-0.01, p=0.84, and rs=0.13, p=0.10, respectively). Conclusion: Majority of the patients have not still perceived the constituents of salt-free diet despite the implementation of the governmental salt reduction program. More impressive dietetic and psycho-educational techniques to promote dietary changes and compliance should be implemented.","[Ersan, Sibel; Liv, Fatma; Tanrisev, Mehmet; Colak, Hulya; Yilmaz, Banu; Alp, Alper] Izmir Tepecik Res & Training Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Izmir, Turkey","Ersan, S (corresponding author), Izmir Tepecik Res & Training Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Izmir, Turkey.",,"ERSAN, SİBEL/ABF-1542-2021; Alp, Alper/AAK-2766-2020; Colak, Hulya/AAB-1979-2021","ERSAN, SİBEL/0000-0002-9381-5262; Alp, Alper/0000-0002-2864-361X; ",,,"Agondi RD, 2011, J RENAL NUTR, V21, P160, DOI 10.1053/j.jrn.2010.03.00; Baines LS, 2000, NEPHRON, V85, P1, DOI 10.1159/00004562; CHAN CY, 1994, DIALYSIS TRANSPLANT, V23, P18; CUMMINGS KM, 1982, MED CARE, V20, P567, DOI 10.1097/00005650-198206000-0000; Durose CL, 2004, J AM DIET ASSOC, V104, P35, DOI 10.1016/j.jada.2003.10.01; Erdem Y, 2010, BLOOD PRESSURE, V19, P313, DOI 10.3109/0803705100380254; Hecking M, 2013, AM J NEPHROL, V38, P78, DOI 10.1159/00035310; Lee SH, 2002, INT J NURS STUD, V39, P695, DOI 10.1016/S0020-7489(02)00007-; Mason H, 2014, PLOS ONE, V9, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.008444; Park KA, 2008, J RENAL NUTR, V18, P415, DOI 10.1053/j.jrn.2008.04.00; Saran R, 2003, KIDNEY INT, V64, P254, DOI 10.1046/j.1523-1755.2003.00064.; Shepherd R, 2002, P NUTR SOC, V61, P267, DOI 10.1079/PNS200214; Strazzullo P, 2012, NUTR METAB CARDIOVAS, V22, P161, DOI 10.1016/j.numecd.2011.10.00; Suckling RJ, 2010, COCHRANE DB SYST REV, DOI 10.1002/14651858.CD006763.pub; Topbas E, 2015, J REN CAR; Welch JL, 2005, INT J NURS STUD, V42, P597, DOI 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2004.09.01; Wiser NA, 1997, J RENAL NUTR, V7, P187, DOI DOI 10.1016/S1051-2276(97)90017-",17,2,2,1,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,2.0,,,,,217.0,222,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_2_032,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2RK,WOS:000397230700007,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001756198347107438,7.455772830306566e-18,0.002890651482847333,0.06208988922599309,0.002890651482847333

Although Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has been widely used as a marker for predicting the severity of DM, there are controversial reports in the literature regarding its association with the severity of CAD. The aim of our study was to determine the association between HbA1c levels and severity of CAD in both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetic patients with admission hyperglycemia. Materials and methods: The files of the patients who were admitted to the emergency department of a regional training and research hospital from 2014 to 2015 due to acute coronary syndrome and whose diagnosis was confirmed by coronary angiography and HbA1c levels were analyzed were reviewed retrospectively. Those patients whose HbA1c levels were measured were divided into two groups: diagnosed diabetes (DD) or undiagnosed diabetes (UDD). Gensini score was measured for all patients and the correlation between elevated HbA1c levels and severity of coronary artery disease was subjected to statistical analysis. Results: Out of 168 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 85.1% (n=143) were male, while 14.9% (n=25) were female. The mean age was 46.6 +/- 6.5 years. HbA1c was found to have a significantly positive correlation with the Gensini score in DD group (n=77), whereas no significant correlation was found between HbA1c and the Gensini score in UDD group (n=91) (p <0.001; correlation coefficient: 0.656, p=0.207; correlation coefficient: 0.251, respectively). Linear regression analysis revealed that HbA1c was a significant predictor for gensini score (p<0.001; a: 0.632). Conclusion: HbA1c can be used as a predictor for the evaluation of diabetic patients with CAD. Moreover, HbA1c was not found to have a significant association with the severity of CAD in undiagnosed diabetic CAD patients with admission hyperglycemia.","[Guven, Ramazan] Bitlis State Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Bitlis, Turkey; [Aykal, Guzin] Antalya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Biochem, Antalya, Turkey; [Gungor, Faruk; Akyol, K.

Methods and Materials: The method of this study was descriptive followed by a casual-comparative design. The statistical population of this study included all mothers of children with mental disorders and mothers of physically and mentally disabled children in Zahedan. The statistical sample consisted of 63 mothers of children with mental disorders, including emotional disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, and developmental disorders, selected using the random sampling method. The sample was matched with 63 mothers of physically and mentally disabled children chosen among clients admitted to rehabilitation centers and clinics in Zahedan. These two groups filled out the Garnefski, Kraaij, and Spinhoven Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and the Leahy Emotional Schemas Scale. The obtained data was analyzed using the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Results: The results indicated that compared to the mothers of disabled children, the mothers of children with mental disorders obtained higher scores on self-blame, catastrophizing, and other-blame (the subscales of maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies), putting into perspective (the subscale of adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies), emotional self-awareness, expression of feelings, not being controlled, comprehensibility, simplistic view of emotions, and acceptance of feelings (the subscales of emotional schemas). Conclusion: It can be concluded that using these improper strategies can put these mothers at the risk of mental issues and conflicts. Therefore, through training efficient emotional schemas and adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies, these mothers can be aided to improve their conditions.","[Jenaabadi, Hossein] Univ Sistan & Baluchestan, Fac Educ Sci & Psychol, Dept Educ Sci, Zahedan, Iran","Jenaabadi, H (corresponding author), Univ Sistan & Baluchestan, Fac Educ Sci & Psychol, Dept Educ Sci, Zahedan, Iran.",hjenaabadi@ped.usb.ac.ir,,"Jenaabadi, Hossein/0000-0002-4373-9353",,,"Ahmadi KH, 2013, J BEHAV SCI, V6, P33; Aldao A, 2010, CLIN PSYCHOL REV, V30, P217, DOI 10.1016/j.cpr.2009.11.00; Aminzadeh A, 2011, J REHABIL, V18, P3; Bargh J.A., 2007, HDB EMOTION REGULATI, P429, DOI DOI 10.3109/00048674.2010.49635; Baxter AC, 2007, J AUTISM DEV DISORD, V37, P976, DOI 10.1007/s10803-006-0217-; BHAVNAGRI NP, 1999, EARLY EDUC DEV, V10, P55; Campbell-Sills L., 2007, HDB EMOTION REGULATI, P54; Cordova JV, 2005, J SOC CLIN PSYCHOL, V24, P218, DOI 10.1521/jscp.24.2.218.6227; Darvishi M, 2015, J ARAK U MED SCI, V18, P3; Dowdell E B, 1995, J Psychosoc Nurs Ment Health Serv, V33, P2; Garnefski N, 2004, PERS INDIV DIFFER, V36, P267, DOI 10.1016/S0191-8869(03)00083-; Garnefski N, 2003, J YOUTH ADOLESCENCE, V32, P401, DOI 10.1023/A:102599420055; Gross JJ, 2007, HDB EMOTION REGULATI, V2007, P3, DOI DOI 10.'1080/0014013060097113; Hames A, 1998, CHILD CARE HLTH DEV, V24, P15; Hankin, 2001, DRUG BENEFIT TRENDS, V13, P1; Hasani J, 2014, J CLIN PSYCHOL, V6, P9; Hasani J., 2011, J CLIN PSYCHOL, V2, P7; Jamilian H R, 2014, Glob J Health Sci, V6, P116, DOI 10.5539/gjhs.v6n7p11; Karimi HR, 2004, REHABILITATION SERV; Khanzade M., 2012, J CLIN PSYCHOL, V11, P9; KOEGEL RL, 1992, J AUTISM DEV DISORD, V22, P205, DOI 10.1007/BF0105815; Leahy R.

Different parameters have been found to be predictive and prognostic. This study was conducted to investigate the serum levels of interleukin-32 (IL-32) in patients with PA and the relationship with tumor progression and known prognostic parameters. Materials and methods: Thirty-three patients with PA were investigated. Blood samples were obtained from patients with PA at first admission, one month after surgery and two weeks before adjuvant or palliative treatment. Age and sex matched 30 healthy controls were included in the analysis. Serum IL-32 levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The median age at diagnosis was 59 years, range 32-84 years; 20 (61%) patients were men. The tumor was located in the head of the pancreas in 21 (63%) patients. The most common metastatic site was liver in 23 patients with metastasis (n = 19, 83%). The median follow-up time was 26.0 weeks (range: 1.0-184.0 weeks). At the end of the observation period, thirty-two patients (97%) were dead. Thirty-nine percent of 23 metastatic patients who received palliative chemotherapy (CTx) were CTx-responsive. Median overall survival (OS) of the whole group was 41.3 +/- 8.3 weeks [95% confidence interval (CI) = 25-58 weeks]. The baseline serum IL-32 levels were significantly higher in patients with PA than in the control group (p=0.04). Serum IL-32 levels were significantly higher in the patients with liver metastatic disease (p=0.05). Moreover, patients with elevated serum IL-32 concentrations had significantly favorable OS compared with those with lower levels (median 47.2 vs 32.7 weeks, respectively, p = 0.05). Conclusion: Despite new therapies; the prognosis of PA is still poor. There is need to find new parameters. Serum levels of IL-32 may be a good diagnostic and prognostic marker for PA according to our data.","[Karabulut, Mehmet; Peker, Kivanc Derya; Gemici, Eyup] Istanbul Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Gen Surg, Istanbul, Turkey; [Afsar, Cigdem Usul] Acibadem Bakirkoy Hosp, Clin Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Karabulut, Senem] Istanbul Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Dagoglu, Nergiz; Karaman, Sule] Istanbul Univ, Inst Oncol, Dept Radiat Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Yasasever, Ceren Tilgen] Istanbul Univ, Inst Oncol, Dept Basic Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Tas, Faruk] Istanbul Univ, Inst Oncol, Dept Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey","Afsar, CU (corresponding author), Acibadem Bakirkoy Hosp, Clin Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Dagoglu, Nergiz/AAE-7450-2020; Tas, Faruk/AAF-8751-2019; Karaman, Sule/AAS-5135-2020; karabulut, senem/AAT-3594-2020; Yasasever, Ceren Tilgen/A-6547-2018; Peker, Kivanc Derya Derya/D-8801-2015; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/C-3436-2015; Gemici, Eyüp/ABC-5796-2020; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/AAA-6103-2021","Karaman, Sule/0000-0002-4810-4453; Yasasever, Ceren Tilgen/0000-0002-8732-4117; Peker, Kivanc Derya Derya/0000-0002-8887-3505; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639",,,"Bellone G, 2006, CANCER IMMUNOL IMMUN, V55, P684, DOI 10.1007/s00262-005-0047-; Ben-Baruch A, 2006, SEMIN CANCER BIOL, V16, P38, DOI 10.1016/j.semcancer.2005.07.00; Egberts JH, 2008, CANCER RES, V68, P1443, DOI 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-570; Erturk K, 2016, TUMOR BIOL, V37, P405, DOI 10.1007/s13277-015-3829-; Farrow B, 2002, SURG ONCOL, V10, P153, DOI 10.1016/S0960-7404(02)00015-; Hong JT, 2017, PHARMACOL THERAPEUT, V174, P127, DOI 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2017.02.02; Ishigami S, 2013, MED ONCOL, V30, DOI 10.1007/s12032-013-0472-; Jemal A, 2011, CA-CANCER J CLIN, V61, P69, DOI [10.3322/caac.20107, 10.3322/caac.20115; Kang YH, 2012, CANCER LETT, V318, P226, DOI 10.1016/j.canlet.2011.12.02; Kim SH, 2005, IMMUNITY, V22, P131, DOI 10.1016/j.immuni.2004.12.00; Kollmar O, 2006, ANN SURG ONCOL, V13, P263, DOI 10.1245/ASO.2006.03.09; Leach SD, 2015, J EXP MED, V212, P284, DOI 10.1084/jem.2123insight; Lee HJ, 2012, ONCOL LETT, V3, P490, DOI 10.3892/ol.2011.51; Lesina M, 2011, CANCER CELL, V19, P456, DOI 10.1016/j.ccr.2011.03.00; Li YJ, 2012, MOL CANCER, V11, DOI 10.1186/1476-4598-11-8; Ling JH, 2012, CANCER CELL, V21, P105, DOI 10.1016/j.ccr.2011.12.00; McCawley LJ, 2001, CURR BIOL, V11, pR25, DOI 10.1016/S0960-9822(00)00038-; Muerkoster S, 2004, CANCER RES, V64, P1331, DOI 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-186; Netea MG, 2005, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V102, P16309, DOI 10.1073/pnas.050823710; Nishida A, 2009, J BIOL CHEM, V284, P17868, DOI 10.1074/jbc.M90036820; Okada S, 1998, JPN J CLIN ONCOL, V28, P12, DOI 10.1093/jjco/28.1.1; Paniccia A, 2015, CHINESE J CANCER RES, V27, P376, DOI 10.3978/j.issn.1000-9604.2015.05.0; Park JS, 2013, CELL ONCOL, V36, P493, DOI 10.1007/s13402-013-0154-; Poch B, 2007, LANGENBECK ARCH SURG, V392, P353, DOI 10.1007/s00423-006-0140-; Rhim AD, 2014, CANCER CELL, V25, P735, DOI 10.1016/j.ccr.2014.04.02; Seo EH, 2008, J MICROBIOL BIOTECHN, V18, P160; Siegel R, 2014, CA-CANCER J CLIN, V64, P9, DOI [10.3322/caac.21254, 10.1001/jamaoto.2014.2530, 10.3322/caac.21208, 10.1136/bmj.g1502; Sorrentino C, 2009, AM J RESP CRIT CARE, V180, P769, DOI 10.1164/rccm.200903-0400O; Sullivan NJ, 2009, ONCOGENE, V28, P2940, DOI 10.1038/onc.2009.18; Sunaga N, 2012, INT J CANCER, V130, P1733, DOI 10.1002/ijc.2616; Tjomsland V, 2011, NEOPLASIA, V13, P664, DOI 10.1593/neo.1133; Tsai CY, 2014, CLIN CANCER RES, V20, P2276, DOI 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-122; Wang SM, 2015, ONCOL LETT, V9, P305, DOI 10.3892/ol.2014.264; Wang YW, 2017, BIOMARKERS, V22, P165, DOI 10.1080/1354750X.2016.125295; Wu HH, 2015, J EXP MED, V212, P333, DOI 10.1084/jem.2014170; Yousif NG, 2013, CYTOKINE, V61, P223, DOI 10.1016/j.cyto.2012.09.02; Yu XZ, 2015, TUMOR BIOL, V36, P5265, DOI 10.1007/s13277-015-3186-; Zeng QL, 2014, CYTOKINE, V65, P24, DOI 10.1016/j.cyto.2013.09.01; Zhang Y, 2015, REV RECENT CLIN TRIA, V10, P317, DOI 10.2174/157488711066615091614253",39,1,1,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,613.0,619,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_091,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700012,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0040289256198347105,7.467684534604662e-15,0.03857482043428766,0.08735910186179574,0.03774973872036152

The majority of esophageal cancers are squamous cell or adenocarcinomas. Although the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is decreasing in the United States, the incidence of adenocarcinoma arising out of Barrett's esophagus is rising dramatically, although less so in the last few years. Treatment in locally advanced EC (LA-EC) must be multidisciplinary. There are only few factors which affects the prognosis. Our aim was to investigate the prognostic and predictive roles of pretreatment neutrophil/leucocyte (neu/leu) ratios in LA-EC patients receiving chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Materials and methods: Sixty patients with non-metastatic EC (youngest 31 years old) who applied to our hospital between 2011 and 2015 were included in this study. Neu/leu ratios were calculated before CRT and after CRT. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for estimating the survival function from lifetime data. In addition, Cox regression model was also used to explore the relationship between the survival of a patient and several explanatory variables. Results: There was statistical significance between neu/leu ratio before CRT and OS (p=0.047). One unit increase in neu/leu ratio, increases the probability of being alive 2.725 times (1/0.367). There was statistical significance between neu/leu ratio before CRT and progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.046). One unit increase in neu/leu ratio, increases the probability of no relapse 3.559 (1/0.281) times. This means that the patients with higher neu/leu ratio before CRT have a lower risk of relapse. Discussion and conclusion: Multimodal therapeutic strategies combining chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery have been shown to be feasible and to have a positive impact on outcomes by decreasing the risk of locoregional recurrence and often by increasing overall survival. The overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of patients is too short in patients with LA-EC. Our study shows that patients with LA-EC who had higher pretreatment neu/leu ratios have better OS and PFS.","[Karaca, Feryal] Adana Numune Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Radiat Oncol, Adana, Turkey; [Afsar, Cigdem Usul] Acibadem Bakirkoy Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Almali, Necat] Van YuzuncuYil Univ, Med Fac, Dept Gen Surg, Van, Turkey; [Karabulut, Senem] Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Karabulut, Mehmet] Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Istanbul, Turkey; [Keskin, Siddik] Van YuzuncuYil Univ, Med Fac, Dept Biostat, Van, Turkey; [Akbulut, Serkan] Adana Numune Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Adana, Turkey","Afsar, CU (corresponding author), Acibadem Bakirkoy Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Afsar, Cigdem Usul/AAA-6103-2021; Akbulut, Serkan/T-5710-2018; karabulut, senem/AAT-3594-2020; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/C-3436-2015","Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639; Akbulut, Serkan/0000-0002-2043-2754; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639",,,"Allum WH, 2009, J CLIN ONCOL, V27, P5062, DOI 10.1200/JCO.2009.22.208; [Anonymous], 2014, ANN SURG, DOI DOI 10.1097/SLA.0000000000000666; Conroy T, 2014, LANCET ONCOL, V15, P305, DOI 10.1016/S1470-2045(14)70028-; Di Fiore F, 2007, AM J GASTROENTEROL, V102, P2557, DOI 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2007.01437.; Engel LS, 2003, J NATL CANCER I, V95, P1404, DOI 10.1093/jnci/djg04; Enzinger PC, 2003, NEW ENGL J MED, V349, P2241, DOI 10.1056/NEJMra03501; Gebski V, 2007, LANCET ONCOL, V8, P226, DOI 10.1016/S1470-2045(07)70039-; Gholipour C, 2008, DIS ESOPHAGUS, V21, P322, DOI 10.1111/j.1442-2050.2007.00776.; Huang LJ, 2012, DIAGN PATHOL, V7, DOI 10.1186/1746-1596-7-18; Kelsen DP, 2007, J CLIN ONCOL, V25, P3719, DOI 10.1200/JCO.2006.10.476; Khushalani NI, 2008, MAYO CLIN PROC, V83, P71; LEICHMAN L, 1991, SEMIN ONCOL, V18, P6; Nozoe T, 2001, AM J SURG, V182, P197, DOI 10.1016/S0002-9610(01)00684-; Shan L, 2013, DIAGN PATHOL, V8, DOI 10.1186/1746-1596-8-7; Sobin L.

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is a more severe form of Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease which is characterised by steatosis, lobular inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis in liver biopsies. In this study, we aimed to investigate any possible relationship between the ABO/Rh blood group system and Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease /Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, in Turkey. Materials and methods: A total of 179 patients with hepatosteatosis from Kayseri Training and Research Hospital between the years 2002-2012 were included in the study. The distributions of blood groups of the patients with Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease were compared with the distribution of blood groups of 17.314 healthy donors. The patients were examined for any association between ABO/Rh blood groups and Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease /Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and also for an association between ABO/Rh blood groups and grading. Results: Group AB was found to be higher in patients with Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease compared to the control group (p=0.04). The percentage of patients with steatohepatitis was significantly higher in group AB than non-AB blood group (p=0.024). The percentage of patients with steatohepatitis was significantly higher in group grade 3 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients than other two -grade 1 and grade 2 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease -groups (<0.001). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first analysis in the literature that investigates the association between the ABO blood groups and Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease /Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. This epidemiological study can not explain the mechanism behind the blood group effect but may be a light for future studies.","[Karagoz, Hatice; Karaman, Ahmet] Acibadem Kayseri Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Kayseri, Turkey; [Erden, Abdulsamet; Ozer, Ozerhan; Cetinkaya, Ali; Avci, Deniz; Gencer, Vedat; Arik, Ferhat; Kalan, Ugur; Gorkem, Hasan] Kayseri Training & Res Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Kayseri, Turkey; [Karaman, Hatice] Kayseri Training & Res Hosp, Dept Clin Pathol, Kayseri, Turkey","Erden, A (corresponding author), Kayseri Training & Res Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Kayseri, Turkey.",,"Karaman, Hatice/AAX-1803-2021; Erden, Abdulsamet/W-2397-2019; ÖZER, ÖZERHAN/O-6794-2015; KARAMAN, HATİCE/AAW-2604-2021; Karagöz, Hatice/AAP-8029-2020","ÖZER, ÖZERHAN/0000-0001-5855-5509; KARAMAN, HATİCE/0000-0002-5250-5663; ",,,"Adams LA, 2005, DIABETIC MED, V22, P1129, DOI 10.1111/j.1464-5491.2005.01748.; ALSARRAF M, 1974, CANCER-AM CANCER SOC, V33, P574, DOI 10.1002/1097-0142(197402)33:2<574::AID-CNCR2820330237>3.0.CO;2-; Anderson EL, 2015, PLOS ONE, V10, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.014090; Chandra T, 2012, IRAN J PEDIATR HEMAT, V2, P14; Corrado RL, 2014, MED CLIN N AM, V98, P55, DOI 10.1016/j.mcna.2013.09.00; Farhud DD, 2013, IRAN J PUBLIC HEALTH, V42, P; Flegel WA, 2013, BLOOD TRANSFUS-ITALY, V11, P6, DOI 10.2450/2012.0250-1; HAMLYN AN, 1974, GUT, V15, P480, DOI 10.1136/gut.15.6.48; Hiltunen LM, 2009, THROMB RES, V124, P167, DOI 10.1016/j.thromres.2008.11.01; JICK H, 1969, LANCET, V1, P53; Kamil M, 2010, LIBYAN J MED, V5, DOI 10.3402/ljm.v5i0.484; Karagoz H, 2015, THER CLIN RISK MANAG, V11, P1613, DOI 10.2147/TCRM.S9229; Larsen TB, 2005, J THROMB HAEMOST, V3, P300, DOI 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2005.01195.; Matteoni CA, 1999, GASTROENTEROLOGY, V116, P1413, DOI 10.1016/S0016-5085(99)70506-; MAY D, 1973, BMJ-BRIT MED J, V4, P738, DOI 10.1136/bmj.4.5894.73; MELENDEZ M, 1979, GUT, V20, P288, DOI 10.1136/gut.20.4.28; Morelli VM, 2005, J THROMB HAEMOST, V3, P183, DOI 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2004.01071.; Salomone F, 2015, BIOMED RES INT, V2015, DOI 10.1155/2015/15327; SANKALE M, 1968, PATHOL BIOL, V16, P107; Shavakhi A, 2012, J RES MED SCI, V17, P46; SPINILLO A, 1995, J HUM HYPERTENS, V9, P62; Stal P, 2015, WORLD J GASTROENTERO, V21, P11077, DOI 10.3748/wjg.v21.i39.1107; Torres DM, 2012, CLIN GASTROENTEROL H, V10, P837, DOI 10.1016/j.cgh.2012.03.01; Yang M, 2015, PLOS ONE, V10, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.013166; ZUCKERMAN A.

S. mutans is a significant contributor to tooth decay. The potential application of probiotic bacteria for control and prevention of oral diseases has been the focus of the attention for various health researchers. Material and methods: In this study, primarily, we examined the antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus routeri (L. routeri) against S. mutans using the spot agar test. Secondly, the ability of L. routeri to inhibit the adhesion of pathogenic S. mutans to human epidermoid laryngeal (HEp-2) cell line was tested using coincubation assay. In co incubation experiment, both bacteria were added to HEp-2 cells simultaneously and the number of adhered pathogen was counted in the presence and absent of probiotic bacteria. Results: The result showed that, the presence of L. routeri decreased S. mutans adhesion by 4-folds. Conclusion: In conclusion, probiotic bacteria may prevent colonization of oral cavity by odours producing bacteria: S. mutans.","[Khodaii, Zohreh; Natanzi, Mahboobeh Mehrabani] Alborz Univ Med Sci, Dietary Supplements & Probiot Res Ctr, Karaj, Iran; [Khodaii, Zohreh; Natanzi, Mahboobeh Mehrabani] Alborz Univ Med Sci, Dept Biochem Genet & Nutr, Fac Med, Karaj, Iran; [Ghaderian, Sayyed Mohammad Hossein] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Dept Med Genet, Fac Med, Tehran, Iran","Natanzi, MM (corresponding author), Eshteraki Blvd Baghestan, Karaj 9779453, Iran.",Mahboobehmehrabani@yahoo.com,"ghaderian, sayyed mohammad hossein/O-5566-2019; mehrabani natanzi, mahboobeh/O-3489-2017; Khodaii, Zohreh/S-4983-2017","ghaderian, sayyed mohammad hossein/0000-0002-2534-071X; mehrabani natanzi, mahboobeh/0000-0001-8879-5984; Khodaii, Zohreh/0000-0002-8858-1983",,,"Bowen WH, 2011, CARIES RES, V45, P69, DOI 10.1159/00032459; Chaiyasut C, 2012, AFR J MICROBIOL RES, V6, P1658, DOI 10.5897/AJMR10.13; Chang YC, 2001, ORAL SURG ORAL MED O, V92, P446, DOI 10.1067/moe.2001.11681; FARZIANPOUR F, 2014, AM J AGR BIOL SCI, V9, P147, DOI DOI 10.3844/AJAB-SSP.2014.147.15; Hasslof P, 2010, BMC ORAL HEALTH, V10, DOI 10.1186/1472-6831-10-1; Jenkinson HF, 2011, ENVIRON MICROBIOL, V13, P3077, DOI 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02573.; Lebeer S, 2010, BENEF MICROBES, V1, P335, DOI 10.3920/BM2010.003; Mehrabani M, 2013, INT J ENTRIC PATHOG, V1, P5; Nase L, 2001, CARIES RES, V35, P412, DOI 10.1159/00004748; Organization WH, 2001, HLTH NUTR PROP PRO; Ouwehand AC, 1999, FEMS MICROBIOL LETT, V177, P35, DOI 10.1111/j.1574-6968.1999.tb13710.; Sadoun D., 2014, INT J APPL MICROBIOL, V2, P5; Smith EG, 2012, J DENT RES, V91, P133, DOI 10.1177/002203451141541; Takahashi N, 2011, J DENT RES, V90, P294, DOI 10.1177/002203451037960; Twetman S, 2012, Adv Dent Res, V24, P98, DOI 10.1177/002203451244946; Wade WG, 2013, PHARMACOL RES, V69, P137, DOI 10.1016/j.phrs.2012.11.00; Wu CC, 2015, MOL ORAL MICROBIOL, V30, P16, DOI 10.1111/omi.1206; Yanine N, 2013, CLIN ORAL INVEST, V17, P1627, DOI 10.1007/s00784-013-0990-",18,3,3,1,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,2.0,,,,,301.0,304,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_2_045,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2RK,WOS:000397230700020,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001859504132231405,7.291934199472967e-15,0.0035094935871218167,0.08858384808968199,0.0035094935871218167

Although there are pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment methods, these are generally insufficient to alleviate pain and the disability in advanced cases Although total knee arthroplasty improves quality of life and provides a generally high level of patient satisfaction for treatment of advanced gonarthrosis, it is not always without complications. Herein we present a new technique consisting of patellofemoral joint irrigation, simple osteophytectomy if needed, lateral patellar retinaculum release, subchondral drilling of the proximal tibia, percutaneous medial collateral ligament release, intra-articular injection of proximal tibial bone marrow, and the results of this treatment applied under local anesthesia in 20 knees of 13 patients. The mean VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) was 8.20 +/- 0.68 prior to treatment and 3.33 +/- 0.72 after treatment; the values were 18.67 +/- 3.34 and 4.10 +/- 3.15 for leg measurements, 7.80 +/- 0.77 and 1.07 +/- 0.96 for pain, 5.07 +/- 2.28 and 1.80 +/- 1.42 for walking, and 5.80 +/- 0.92 and 1.23 +/- 0.92 for daily living activities, respectively. All decreases were statistically significant (p = 0.001 for p < 0.01 in all cases). Biological treatment solutions to gonarthrosis without using foreign materials could decrease the need for prosthetic surgery and its related complications, as well as the need for further attempts at revision.

We investigated the significance of IL-17 and IL-23 in the pathogenesis of by chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis measuring the levels of these proinflammatory cytokines in serum and nasal lavage samples. Materials and methods: Twenty-five patients aged >18 years with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and a control group with 25 healthy subjects were included the study. The levels of IL-17 and IL-23 were measured in the serum and nasal lavage fluids using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: The average serum level of IL-17 was 10.2 pg/ml in the study group, and it was 5.0 pg/ml in the control group. The average nasal lavage level of IL-17 was 16.8 pg/ml in the study group compared with 1.0 pg/ml in the control group. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the serum levels of IL-17 or IL-23; however, a significant difference between the two groups was found in the lavage fluid levels of IL-17 (p < 0.001). Conclusion: We found a significant difference in the nasal lavage fluid levels of IL-17, which demonstrates the importance of local inflammation. This supports the hypothesis that IL-17 is significant in the pathogenesis of nasal polyposis.","[Koca, Rahime; Osma, Ustun; Yilmaz, Mustafa Deniz; Selcuk, Omer Tarik; Renda, Levent] Antalya Educ & Res Hosp, Dept ENT Head & Neck Surg, Antalya, Turkey; [Eyigor, Mete; Eyigor, Hulya; Gultekin, Meral] Akdeniz Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Antalya, Turkey","Selcuk, OT (corresponding author), Antalya Educ & Res Hosp, ENT Dept, Antalya, Turkey.",,"Selcuk, Omer/AAJ-3450-2021; Eyigor, Mete/C-1251-2016","Selcuk, Omer/0000-0002-7364-7599; ",Antalya Education and Research Hospital,The study was funded by Antalya Education and Research Hospital<SUP>1</SUP>,"Aggarwal S, 2002, J LEUKOCYTE BIOL, V71, P; Beadling C, 2006, ARCH IMMUNOL THER EX, V54, P15, DOI 10.1007/s00005-006-0002-; Bernstein JM, 1995, OTOLARYNG HEAD NECK, V113, P724, DOI 10.1016/S0194-5998(95)70012-; Ciprandi G, 2009, ALLERGY, V64, P1375, DOI 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02010.; [杜进涛 Du Jintao], 2010, [四川大学学报. 医学版, Journal of Sichuan University.

The aim of this study is to identify whether their is a significant relationship between mean value of platelet volume obtained from complete blood cell count of the patients diagnosed with haemorrhagic stroke, corpuscular distribution volume value and bleeding volume value identified in the computed tomography scans of the head. Material and method: The sample of the study consisted of all patients aged above 18 and diagnosed with haemorrhagic stroke who applied to Emergency Unit at Adana Numune Education and Research Hospital between 1, June 2014 and 30, July 2016. Results: The sample included 86 patients with haemorrhagic stroke. The sample consisted of 58 % (n=50) male and 41,9 % (n=36) female. The mean value for the patients' ages was 60,4 +/- 16,5. Among the patients, 60,5 % (n=52) of them were observed to have applied to the emergency service with sudden clouding of consciousness. A high majority of patients these (79,5 %) were later exitus. The mean value of red cells distribution volume of the patients with exitus was significantly higher than those of surviving patients' (p<0,05). Parenchymal bleeding was observed to exist in 55,8 % (n=48) of the patients. The mortality rate for the patients with high bleeding volume was higher. Conclusion: Impaired consciousness, existence of hypertension, high corpuscular distribution and bleeding volume can be among the factors affecting mortality.","[Komurcu, Ozkan] Sehit Kamil State Hosp, Emergency Med Serv, Gaziantep, Turkey; [Avci, Akkan; Gulen, Muge; Ozer, Ali Ilker; Ulger, Huseyin; Satar, Salim] Health Sci Univ, Adana Numune Training & Res Hosp, Adana, Turkey; [Kocer, Mursel] Balikligol State Hosp, Emergency Serv, Sanliurfa, Turkey","Avci, A (corresponding author), Hlth Sci Univ, Adana Numune Training & Res Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, TR-01240 Adana, Turkey.",,,,,,"Akca ASD, 2012, TURK J GERIATR, V15, P15; Ali SS, 2000, HYPERTENSION COMPANI, P11; Altintas O, 2017, TURK NEUROSURG, V27, P368, DOI 10.5137/1019-5149.JTN.16136-15.; Ani C, 2009, J NEUROL SCI, V277, P103, DOI 10.1016/j.jns.2008.10.02; Cheung RTF, 2003, STROKE, V34, P1717, DOI 10.1161/01.STR.0000078657.22835.B; Cigsar G, 2015, KAFKAS J MED SCI, V5, P; DENNIS MS, 1993, STROKE, V24, P796, DOI 10.1161/01.STR.24.6.79; Eroglu A, 2012, TURK NOROSIRURJI DER, V22, P16; FIESCHI C, 1988, STROKE, V19, P192, DOI 10.1161/01.STR.19.2.19; Fukuta H, 2009, INT HEART J, V50, P301, DOI 10.1536/ihj.50.30; Garcia JH, 1994, INTRACEREBRAL HEMORR, P4; Gul HL, 2006, THESI; Gurol ME., 2010, KLIN GELISIM DERGISI, V23, P1; Hommel M., 2014, CEREBROVASC DIS, P77; Kim JA, 1996, BIOCHEM BIOPH RES CO, V27, P5; Kiyan S, 2009, EURASIAN J EMERG MED, V8, P15, DOI 10.4170/JAEM.2009.4633; Lopez-Farre A, 2001, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V16, P45, DOI 10.1093/ndt/16.suppl_1.4; Mayda DF, 2010, J STROKE CEREBROVASC, V19, P6; Mozaffarian D, 2016, CIRCULATION, V133, P447, DOI 10.1161/CIR.000000000000036; MULLEY GP, 1983, THROMB HAEMOSTASIS, V50, P52; Naidech AM, 2009, ANN NEUROL, V65, P352, DOI 10.1002/ana.2161; Nickenig G, 2002, CIRCULATION, V105, P393, DOI 10.1161/hc0302.10261; NIIZUMA H, 1988, STROKE, V19, P987, DOI 10.1161/01.STR.19.8.98; Ogihara T, 2002, HYPERTENSION, V40, P872, DOI 10.1161/01.HYP.0000040262.48405.A; Ozdemir G, 2002, INTRASEREBRAL HEMORA, P15; Patel KV, 2010, J GERONTOL A-BIOL, V65, P258, DOI 10.1093/gerona/glp16; Perlstein TS, 2009, ARCH INTERN MED, V169, P588, DOI 10.1001/archinternmed.2009.5; Pierce CN, 2005, PERFUSION-UK, V20, P83, DOI 10.1191/0267659105pf793o; Qureshi AI, 2001, NEW ENGL J MED, V344, P1450, DOI 10.1056/NEJM20010510344190; Serebruany VL, 1998, STROKE, V29, P235, DOI 10.1161/01.STR.29.1.23; STEINER I, 1984, STROKE, V15, P279, DOI 10.1161/01.STR.15.2.27; Takahashi O, 2006, QJM-INT J MED, V99, P743, DOI 10.1093/qjmed/hcl10; Unger T, 2002, AM J CARDIOL, V89, p3; Uyarel H, 2012, INT J CARDIOL, V154, P351, DOI 10.1016/j.ijcard.2011.10.12; Wolf PA, 2000, CIRCULATION, V102, P7; Yilmaz M, 2011, J CLIN EXP INVEST, V2, P40; Ziai Wendy C, 2003, J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis, V12, P201, DOI 10.1016/S1052-3057(03)00075-",37,3,3,2,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,3.0,,,,,527.0,533,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_3_078,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EV3BF,WOS:000401631200026,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003822314049586777,4.4942559798580474e-11,0.060333444085397946,0.10589071815347591,0.05852068357669757

Contact with blood or body secretions of viremic humans or animals is also among the other modes of transmission. In this study, the serological states in terms of CCHF tested in healthcare workers (HCW) who had had contact with two fatal patients with a diagnosis of CCHF. The relation of the transmission possibility with the phylogenetic analysis of the virus were evaluated. Materials and methods: CCHF IgM and IgG were investigated with ELISA one month after contact with index cases in HCW. The contact levels and states of use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were evaluated. Phylogenetic analysis with sequence analysis based on partial sequences of NP coding region was performed for CCHF viruses detected in the index cases. Results: CCHF IgM and IgG were found negative in any of 20 healthcare workers some of whom had a history of high-risk contact. The sequence analysis revealed that the viruses found in both patients were identical. Phylogenetic evaluation showed that both viruses have high homology with the viruses which were determined previously in the endemic area in Turkey. Conclusion: As in our study, detection of virus topotype with sequence analysis in studies about nosocomial transmission will help to determine if there is a difference between virus subtypes in terms of transmission.","[Kuscu, Ferit; Komur, Suheyla; Ulu, Aslihan; Inal, Ayse Seza; Kurtaran, Behice; Tasova, Yesim; Aksu, Hasan Salih Zeki] Cukurova Univ, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol, Adana, Turkey; [Caglayik, Dilek Yagci] Publ Hlth Inst Turkey, Natl Arbovirus & Viral Zoonoses Reference & Res L, Ankara, Turkey; [Caglayik, Dilek Yagci] Marmara Univ, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ozkul, Aykut] Ankara Univ, Fac Vet Med, Dept Virol, Ankara, Turkey","Kuscu, F (corresponding author), Cukurova Univ, Fac Med, Dept Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol, Adana, Turkey.",,"Kuscu, Ferit/L-2974-2016; Inal, Ayse Seza/B-7367-2016; Taşova, Yeşim/H-5871-2018; kömür, süheyla/E-9639-2018; Candevir, Aslihan/A-8016-2015; Çağlayık, Dilek Yağcı/AAD-5747-2020; Ozkul, Aykut/A-1973-2016; Kurtaran, Behice/E-9577-2018","Kuscu, Ferit/0000-0001-5662-8305; Inal, Ayse Seza/0000-0002-1182-7164; Candevir, Aslihan/0000-0001-9340-516X; Çağlayık, Dilek Yağcı/0000-0003-3473-8073; Ozkul, Aykut/0000-0001-5008-9443; Kurtaran, Behice/0000-0002-2081-4664",,,"Ahmed AA, 2005, J GEN VIROL, V86, P3327, DOI 10.1099/vir.0.81175-; Bente DA, 2010, J VIROL, V84, P11089, DOI 10.1128/JVI.01383-1; BURNEY MI, 1980, AM J TROP MED HYG, V29, P941, DOI 10.4269/ajtmh.1980.29.94; Celikbas AK, 2014, EMERG INFECT DIS, V20, P477, DOI 10.3201/eid2003.13135; Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 1988, MMWR Suppl, V37, P; Charrel RN, 2004, CLIN MICROBIOL INFEC, V10, P1040, DOI 10.1111/j.1469-0691.2004.01022.; Ergonul O, 2006, LANCET INFECT DIS, V6, P203, DOI 10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70435-; FELSENSTEIN J, 1985, EVOLUTION, V39, P783, DOI 10.1111/j.1558-5646.1985.tb00420.; Gozel MG, 2013, INT J INFECT DIS, V17, pE1046, DOI 10.1016/j.ijid.2013.05.00; Guner R, 2014, VECTOR-BORNE ZOONOT, V14, P601, DOI 10.1089/vbz.2013.154; Haferkamp S, 2005, VIROL J, V2, DOI 10.1186/1743-422X-2-4; JUKES T H, 1969, P2; Leblebicioglu H, 2016, ANTIVIR RES, V126, P21, DOI 10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.12.00; Morikawa S, 2007, COMP IMMUNOL MICROB, V30, P375, DOI 10.1016/j.cimid.2007.07.00; Oncu Serkan, 2013, Virologica Sinica, V28, P193, DOI 10.1007/s12250-013-3327-; Ozdarendeli A, 2008, ARCH VIROL, V153, P37, DOI 10.1007/s00705-007-1056-; Ozkaya E, 2010, VIRUS RES, V149, P64, DOI 10.1016/j.virusres.2009.12.01; Papa A, 2005, J MED VIROL, V75, P466, DOI 10.1002/jmv.2029; Papa A, 2011, SCAND J INFECT DIS, V43, P225, DOI 10.3109/00365548.2010.54003; Pshenichnaya NY, 2015, INT J INFECT DIS, V33, P120, DOI 10.1016/j.ijid.2014.12.04; SAITOU N, 1987, MOL BIOL EVOL, V4, P406, DOI 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a04045; SULEIMAN MNEH, 1980, LANCET, V2, P93; TAMURA K, 1993, MOL BIOL EVOL, V10, P512, DOI [10.1093/molbev/mst197, 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040023; Tamura K, 2004, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V101, P11030, DOI 10.1073/pnas.040420610; TIGNOR GH, 1993, ANTIVIR RES, V22, P309, DOI 10.1016/0166-3542(93)90040-; Tutuncu EE, 2009, SCAND J INFECT DIS, V41, P377, DOI 10.1080/0036554090288243; VANEEDEN PJ, 1985, S AFR MED J, V68, P71; Vorou R, 2007, CURR OPIN INFECT DIS, V20, P495, DOI 10.1097/QCO.0b013e3282a56a0; Whitehouse CA, 2004, ANTIVIR RES, V64, P145, DOI 10.1016/j.antiviral.2004.08.00",29,3,3,0,8,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,575.0,580,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_084,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700005,,,,,2022-07-14,0.002995867768595041,1.7317477498566097e-20,0.00553276928159413,0.07471730153216781,0.005512506000418786

Weight increase additively afflicts brain structure of cognitively impaired patients but is linked with poor brain volumes even in healthysubjects. Further, several studies show that subjects with psychiatric disorders are more likely than general population to be obese. Hovewer, the process by which weight gain injures cognitive abilities and psychological well-being remain unclear.

In this research, a new drug delivery system is built, which contains a tube of polylactic acid-trimethylene carbonate (PA-TC) equipped with Glial cell line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF) and examined its capability to facilitate functional recovery in femoral nerve injury. At the bottom of the transected femoral nerve in rats, a tube injected with GDNF will be installed. Assessment of functional recovery will be made at the fourth, the eight, and twelfth weeks after injury. Compared with animals remedied by antilogous nerve grafting (p < 0.05), those animals treated with the PA-TC tube loaded with GDNF showed improvement of recovery in muscle action potentials and regenerated fiber area. As a result, we can conclude that drug delivery system which induced nerve regeneration following femoral nerve transaction takes better effects than which induced by antilogous nerve grafting. It is possible to have great potential to be applied in nerve regeneration of femoral nerve transection injury.","[Lei, Wei; Ping, Liao Su; Mou, Xing Dan; Jun, Liu] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Pu Ai Hosp, Dept Hand Surg, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China","Lei, W (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Pu Ai Hosp, Dept Hand Surg, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",eeplore@163.com,,,,,"Agrawal CM, 1997, J BIOMED MATER RES, V38, P105, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(199722)38:2<105::AID-JBM4>3.0.CO;2-; Bozkurt A, 2016, BIOMATERIALS, V75, P112, DOI 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.10.00; Cao JN, 2013, BIOMATERIALS, V34, P1302, DOI 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.10.03; Cao JI, 2011, BIOMATERIALS, V32, P3939, DOI 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.02.02; Chen PR, 2004, BIOMATERIALS, V25, P5667, DOI 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.01.05; Chen YY, 2005, J NEUROPATH EXP NEUR, V64, P613, DOI 10.1097/01.jnen.0000171650.94341.4; Ciaramitaro P, 2010, J PERIPHER NERV SYST, V15, P120, DOI 10.1111/j.1529-8027.2010.00260.; de Boer R, 2011, MICROSURG, V31, P293, DOI 10.1002/micr.2086; Ding T, 2011, REGEN MED, V6, P437, DOI [10.2217/RME.11.39, 10.2217/rme.11.39; Gu XS, 2011, PROG NEUROBIOL, V93, P204, DOI 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2010.11.00; Ha SW, 2009, CHEM COMMUN, P2881, DOI 10.1039/b902195; Hadlock T, 2000, TISSUE ENG, V6, P119, DOI 10.1089/10763270032074; Hernandez-Morato I, 2014, LARYNGOSCOPE, V124, P2750, DOI 10.1002/lary.2475; Immerman I, 2014, BULL HOSP JT DIS, V72, P4; Iorio JA, 2016, CURR REV MUSCULOSKE, V9, P290, DOI 10.1007/s12178-016-9350-; Li BC, 2010, J BIOMED MATER RES A, V94A, P769, DOI 10.1002/jbm.a.3272; Lin H, 2006, J BIOMED MATER RES A, V79A, P591, DOI 10.1002/jbm.a.3086; Luo ZT, 2014, CHEM COMMUN, V50, P5143, DOI 10.1039/c3cc47512; Pattammattel A, 2015, RSC ADV, V5, P59364, DOI 10.1039/c5ra10306; Petis S, 2015, CAN J SURG, V58, P128, DOI 10.1503/cjs.00721; Pierucci A, 2008, TISSUE ENG PT A, V14, P595, DOI 10.1089/tea.2007.027; Sun WJ, 2007, J BIOMED MATER RES A, V83A, P1054, DOI 10.1002/jbm.a.3141; Sun WJ, 2010, J BIOMED MATER RES A, V92A, P887, DOI 10.1002/jbm.a.3244; Sun WJ, 2009, BIOMATERIALS, V30, P4649, DOI 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.05.03; Sun WJ, 2009, PLOS ONE, V4, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.000618; Vega-Cordova X, 2010, LARYNGOSCOPE, V120, P1591, DOI 10.1002/lary.2102; Wood MD, 2013, BIOTECHNOL BIOENG, V110, P1272, DOI 10.1002/bit.2480; Xu YQ, 2016, PLOS ONE, V11, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.014718; Yang XN, 2013, BIOMATERIALS, V34, P5606, DOI 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.04.01; Yin P, 2015, PLOS ONE, V10, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.014197; Yuan JJ, 2015, J MATER SCI-MATER M, V26, DOI 10.1007/s10856-015-5437-",31,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,1117.0,1122,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_175,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500034,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003305785123966942,1.878693213057913e-08,0.00639503261299277,0.12778371813657544,0.00639503261299277

We collected the clinical data of a total of 1025 cases of patients with shoulder joint bankart injury caused by swimming and treated in twenty medical units from January 2014 to December 2015 for a retrospective analysis. All patients voluntarily accepted shoulder arthroscopic anchor implantation and fixation. To further clarify for the effect of treatment, shoulder injury pain degree and athletic ability level of patients before and after treatment were statistically compared. Also, by 6 months' follow-up, stability of the treatment effect was evaluated. The results showed that shoulder arthroscopic anchor implantation and fixation enjoyed very significant effect for shoulder joint bankart injury caused by swimming, with significant improvements in shoulder function scores and pain scores after treatment. Differences before and after treatment were statistically significant (p < 0.05); in addition, after 3 months of treatment, 991 cases of patients had a stable efficacy, without recurring injury and with effective treatment rate at 96.68%; 34 cases of patients had recurrence of shoulder injury, with a recurrence rate at 3.32%. As can be seen from the treatment results, shoulder arthroscopic anchor implantation and fixation showed a significant treatment effect for shoulder joint bankart injury caused by swimming, which can effectively help patients restore joint function, reduce pain in patients, with a high application value and good therapeutic effect.","[Liao, Jun; Deng, Yingjie; Ailijiang, Asila; Liu, Zhenfeng; Meng, Qingcai; Xiang, Wenyuan; Yu, Haicheng; Fang, Rui] Chinese Med Hosp Xinjiang, Dept Orthopaed, Uygur Autonomous Region, Urumqi, Peoples R China","Fang, R (corresponding author), Chinese Med Hosp Xinjiang, Dept Orthopaed, Uygur Autonomous Region, Urumqi, Peoples R China.",jndkhkiu@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [81160460];  [ZYYBZ2013],National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 81160460).; Postdoctoral Research Fund (No. ZYYBZ2013).,"Attari Z, 2016, SAUDI PHARM J, V24, P57, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2015.03.00; Cam R, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P107; Dawood KM, 2017, ARAB J CHEM, V10, P473, DOI 10.1016/j.arabjc.2013.06.00; Halici U, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P80; Kumar R, 2016, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V23, P243, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2015.03.00; Kuppusamy P, 2016, SAUDI PHARM J, V24, P473, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2014.11.01; Li M, 2015, PAK J PHARM SCI, V28, P186; Mohan D, 2016, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V23, P122, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2015.01.01; Moussa TAA, 2016, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V23, P397, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2015.04.01; Ofori-Kwakye K, 2016, SAUDI PHARM J, V24, P82, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2015.03.00; Sandri A.

In homicides committed by criminal organization, the method used intends to be an admonition to other persons. We analyze the criminal organization named Mafia of Gargano, that is a promontory of Apulia Region, in South-East of Italy. We analyze its homicidal mode, the type of weapon used in murders, the drawn body sites and the action recurrence. Previously named Faida of Gargano, the Garganic Mafia was certified by legal court as an inveterate mafia system only in 2009. In fact, in the Garganic area an archaic and violent mafia arise for theft of animals; subsequently, the most profitable activities of these clans became drug and weapons trafficking. The Garganic Mafia is an extremely traditional Mafia, like Camorra, with particularly practices of cadaver concealment. Very often, utilizing natural conformation of Gargano promontory, the criminals throw away the bodies into natural canyons. In this manner, the cadavers are discovered after many years accidentally: this method was classified as Lupara Bianca. Another kind of Apulia's Mafia is the so called Sacra Corona Unita (SCU). Originally it was founded by the Camorra's boss but it's inspired by Calabrian 'Ndrangheta: both these mafia associations was found in south of Italy, Camorra in Campania Region and 'Ndragheta in Calabria Region. In the murders committed by the SCU was frequent the recourse to deception to attract the victim, the use of the gun and the method of Lupara Bianca with the burning of the body. As previously described, the kind of the murder represents the signature of the mafia organization.

Aim of the study is to verify the relationship between psychological problems of cephalalgic patients and sleep disturbances. Materials and methods: 64 subjects (27 females), aged 8-12 years (mean 9.4 years, SD +/- 1.03) with primary headache were enrolled. CBCL 6-18 scale and the SDSC scale were used for behavioral screening and for assessing sleep habits. Results: According to the ICHD-III criteria, the distribution of the headache subtype was as follows: headaches without aura (71.87%), headache episodes typical of tension (7.81%) and chronic headache (7.81%) (Figure 1). CBCL assessment (total problem element) showed an interesting relationship with sleep disorders such as DIMS, DA and SWTD (respectively r = .37, p = 0.019; r = .39, p = 0.015; r = 37, p = 0.019). Discussion: MwA children revealed a specific behavioral phenotype characterized by internalization problems.

Anger must be considered a positive event, even if it may frighten it has a positive effect: transforming an event that could only be destructive and useless in a constructive process, and channeling the child's anger toward a specific goal.","[Maltese, Agata] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy;

The origins of the disability can be traced into childhood and adolescence for most adult migraine sufferers. The group of periodic syndromes consists in symptoms related to migraine, thought to be migraine equivalent or precursors. Aim of this study is to assess the role of MS as risk factors for childhood migraine. Materials and methods: 441 subjects (211 Females) aged 6-13 years (mean 9.20; SD 2.42), consecutively referred between October 2007 to March 2009 for primary headaches to pediatric Centers for Headache in Childhood. Control group consisted of 365 subjects (175 F) aged 7-13 years (mean 9.08; SD 3.02). Results: Two groups were not different for age (F=0.390; p=0.539) and sex ratio (Chi-square=0.002; p=0.966). Headache percentage distribution was the following: MoA 38.32%, MA 11.11%, FETTH 16.78%, CTTH 20.63%. Logistic regression shows a greater OR for CVS and MS associated for migraine group (MoA and MA patients), respectively 8.28 (IC95% 2.35 - 29.16) for CVS and 5.22 (IC95% 3.5 - 7.77); moreover, CVS cause a consistent increase in OR of 3.69 (IC95% 2.21 - 6.17) also for headache group (CTTH and FETTH patients). Discussion: Periodic syndromes could be considered the natural precursors of migraine almost but not only in children, as reported in some studies in adulthood.","[Maltese, Agata] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy;

Material and method: The recordings of patients who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and whose hepatitis serology was recorded in Eskisehir Tepebasi District Yeni Family Health Center's information management system program between the dates of 01.01.2016 - 31.12.2016 were evaluated retrospectively. Age, gender, comorbid diseases of patients were noted. Hepatitis serology and routine blood test results in the last 3 months were taken from the database. SPSS 21 program was used for statistical analyze. Results: A total of 300 patients were reached. 182 (60.7%) of the patients were female and 118 (39.3%) were male. The mean age of the patients was 58.66 +/- 11.44 years. When the patients were questioned regarding treatment method of diabetes, it was found out that 205 patients (68.3%) received only oral antidiabetic (OAD), 54 patients (18.0%) received insulin with OAD, and 41 patients (13.7%) received only insulin therapy. Of the 300 patients in the study group, 16 (5.3%) were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, 62 (20.7%) were hepatitis B surface antibody (AntiHBs) positive and 7 (2.3%) were AntiHCV positive. Conclusion: Vaccination rates of patients can be increased by spending more time on counseling about vaccination and by emphasizing possible problems they may face if not vaccinated.","[Mamur, Ahmet] Eskisehir Publ Hlth Management, Eskisehir, Turkey; [Kayhan, Mehmet] Yeni Family Hlth Care Ctr, Eskisehir, Turkey; [Oztas, Dilek] Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Ankara, Turkey","Mamur, A (corresponding author), Eskisehir Publ Hlth Management, Eskisehir, Turkey.",,"kayhan, mehmet/W-1631-2017","kayhan, mehmet/0000-0001-7493-5165",,,"[Anonymous], 2014, DIABETES CARE, V37, pS5, DOI 10.2337/dc14-S00; Arslan E.

Materials and methods: A total of 24 young female athletes (Age: mean, m = 11.47 year; +/- 0.61 Standard Deviation, SD; Height: m = 143.75 centimeters, +/- 6.13SD; Weight: m = 39.22 kilograms, +/- 3.83SD) practicing team water sports at a competitive level from at least one year participated in the research; 11 of them were part of a synchronized swimming team and 13 of a water polo squad. To carry out the present study, in order to assess personality, self-esteem, mood and visual-spatial skills of sample, the following psychological assessment tests were used: 1) Big Five Questionnaire for Children, 2) Multidimensional Self-esteem Test, 3) Profile of Mood States-Adolescent, and 4) Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test. The study was performed at the sports center Torre del Grifo Village (Mascalucia, Italy). Results: The study has showed, in both groups of athletes, the presence of personological features oriented to establish friendly and cooperative relations; what it makes us conclude that within the two teams there are positive relationships between athletes, also aimed at achieving the common goal, and that the group component is crucial. It is also seen that in the synchronized swimming team the individual dimension emerges strongly, in terms of athletic competition spirit.

The beneficial properties and the nutritional values of pasta are numerous Pasta is a ally of the diet: satiating has great power and is an excellent solution for stress. It also contains vitamins of the B group essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system, the starch paste is free glucose, which promotes the synthesis of serotonin, which gives well-being. Some studies have shown that, among the carbohydrates, the pasta has the lowest glycemic index not therefore increases the levels of C-reactive protein, which proved to be correlated with cardiovascular risk does not increase the risk of hypertension because it contains very little sodium and fiber, the latter fundamental in the prevention of cancer.","[Messina, Antonietta; Monda, Vincenzo; Villano, Ines; Monda, Giuseppe; Chieffi, Sergio; Cibelli, Giuseppe; Messina, Giovanni; Monda, Marcellino] Univ Campania, Dept Expt Med, Sect Human Physiol, Naples, Italy; [Messina, Antonietta; Monda, Vincenzo; Villano, Ines; Monda, Giuseppe; Chieffi, Sergio; Cibelli, Giuseppe; Messina, Giovanni; Monda, Marcellino] Univ Campania, Unit Dietet & Sport Med, Naples, Italy; [Nigro, Ersilia; Messina, Giovanni] CEINGE Biotecnol Avanzate Scarl, Naples, Italy; [Valenzano, Anna A.] Univ Foggia, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Foggia, Italy; [Ascione, Antonio] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Motor Sci & Wellness, Naples, Italy; [Ruberto, Maria] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Med Surg & Dent Specialties, Naples, Italy","Messina, A (corresponding author), Univ Naples 2, Dept Expt Med, Sect Human Physiol, Via Costantinopoli 16, I-80138 Naples, Italy.;Messina, A (corresponding author), Univ Naples 2, Clin Dietet Serv, Via Costantinopoli 16, I-80138 Naples, Italy.",,"Messina, Antonietta/AHH-2383-2022; Cibelli, Giuseppe/AAC-2635-2019; MESSINA, ANTONIETTA/K-9366-2016; Ascione, Antonio/I-9473-2018; Messina, Giovanni/AAE-8668-2022","Messina, Antonietta/0000-0001-8343-432X; Ascione, Antonio/0000-0003-4466-1807; Messina, Giovanni/0000-0002-0011-867X; Nigro, Ersilia/0000-0001-5637-1685; Monda, Marcellino/0000-0002-7184-218X; Monda, Vincenzo/0000-0002-6083-5814; VILLANO, INES/0000-0002-1755-358X; CIBELLI, GIUSEPPE/0000-0002-5371-2584",Pastificio Di Martino Gaetano F. lli Spa,Thanks to Pastificio Di Martino Gaetano & F. lli Spa for non-conditioned financial support for research projects in Nutrition Physiology.,"Carotenuto M, 2006, SLEEP MED, V7, P357, DOI 10.1016/j.sleep.2006.01.00; Carotenuto M, 2009, J ENDOCRINOL INVEST, V32, P752, DOI [10.1007/BF03346531, 10.3275/6398; Chieffi S, 2014, EXP BRAIN RES, V232, P3659, DOI 10.1007/s00221-014-4056-; Chieffi S, 2014, EXP BRAIN RES, V232, P1327, DOI 10.1007/s00221-014-3851-; Di Bernardo G, 2014, STEM CELL RES THER, V5, DOI 10.1186/scrt39; Elia M, 2008, NEUROLOGY, V71, P997, DOI 10.1212/01.wnl.0000326592.37105.8; Esposito T, 2006, J THERM BIOL, V31, P527, DOI 10.1016/j.jtherbio.2006.07.00; Muros JJ, 2017, NUTRITION, V35, P87, DOI 10.1016/j.nut.2016.11.00; Lapi D, 2013, ARCH ITAL BIOL, V151, P11, DOI 10.4449/aib.v151i1.147; Lapi D, 2013, J VASC RES, V50, P332, DOI 10.1159/00035329; Lapi D, 2012, FRONT PHYSIOL, V3, DOI 10.3389/fphys.2012.0009; Lapi D, 2015, MICROCIRCULATION, V22, P79, DOI 10.1111/micc.1217; Lapi D, 2013, CLIN HEMORHEOL MICRO, V54, P415, DOI 10.3233/CH-13176; Lapi D, 2012, FRONT PHYSIOL, V3, DOI 10.3389/fphys.2012.0003; Lapi D, 2011, J PINEAL RES, V51, P136, DOI 10.1111/j.1600-079X.2011.00870.; Messina A, 2016, FRONT NEURAL CIRCUIT, V10, DOI 10.3389/fncir.2016.0006; Messina G., 2015, J PSYCHIAT, V18, DOI [10.4172/2378-5756.1000280, DOI 10.4172/2378-5756.1000280; Messina G., 2014, J ANESTH CLIN RES, V5, DOI [10.4172/2155-6148.1000395, DOI 10.4172/2155-6148.1000395; Messina G., 2015, BIOL MED, V1, P7, DOI [DOI 10.4172/0974-8369.1000S3007, 10.4172/0974-8369.1000S3007; Messina G., 2015, BIOL MED, V7, P1, DOI [10.4172/0974-8369.1000248, DOI 10.4172/0974-8369.1000248, DOI 10.4172/0974-8369.1000240; Messina G, 2017, FRONT PHYSIOL, V8, DOI 10.3389/fphys.2017.0013; Messina Giovanni, 2016, Journal of Basic and Clinical Physiology and Pharmacology, V27, P611, DOI 10.1515/jbcpp-2015-013; Monda M, 2014, OXID MED CELL LONGEV, V2014, DOI 10.1155/2014/13102; Monda V, 2017, OXID MED CELL LONGEV, V2017, DOI 10.1155/2017/383197; Padalino L, 2016, CARBOHYD POLYM, V153, P229, DOI 10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.07.10; Panico A, 2017, PATIENT PREFER ADHER, V11, P423, DOI 10.2147/PPA.S11918; Rinaldi B, 2015, NEURAL PLAST, V2015, DOI 10.1155/2015/26596; Tong TYN, 2016, BMC MED, V14, DOI 10.1186/s12916-016-0677-; Triggiani AI, 2017, CLIN PHYSIOL FUNCT I, V37, P162, DOI 10.1111/cpf.1228; Valenzano A, 2016, INT J SPORT PHYSIOL, V11, P407, DOI 10.1123/ijspp.2015-003",30,6,6,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,641.0,644,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_095,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700016,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0027892561983471073,0.022078175749961786,0.0010773354062471366,0.11051616070511137,0.0009046401463870239

Orexins play an significant role in regulating arousal and attention. The term arousal refers to a person's general state of alertness or excitation, both physiological and psychological. Arousal levels ranges on a continuum from drowsiness through alertness to excitement. Orexin plays an important role in the regulation of feeding behaviour. The orexin stimulates food intake and reduces the metabolic rate, increasing and maintaining the body's energy reserves. Orexins play also a fundamental role in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle by increasing arousal levels and maintaining wakefulness. Its deficit can cause narcolepsy.

Heating of body tissues by radiofrequency (RF) energy is a mechanism for therapeutic. Such effects may be produced by local changes in tissue temperature (for example, thermally induced changes in regional blood flow) and others may be systemic effects due to the additional thermal load on the body. An elevated core temperature increases metabolism and certain other functions such as heart rate, respiration rate, and nerve conduction velocity The aim of this study was to determine whether healthy subjects, non-obese, undergoing treatment with radiofrequency could see changes in REE and SNA, GSR. Twenty healthy adult female, took part in the study. The study protocol consisted of the treatment of twenty minutes of radiofrequency in the abdominal region. Participants in the study were presented in the morning at 8 am fasting for at least 12 h, underwent measurement of REE, HRV and GSR 60 minutes prior to treatment, immediately after treatment, and 120 minutes after treatment. Radiofrequency induced significant increases of REE, sympathetic activity, and GSR. This result is also useful in the interpretation of the relationship between the sympathetic nervous system and food intake in young subjects. It has demonstrated a significant influence of sympathetic activity on eating behavior, also through an increase in thermogenesis.","[Messina, Antonietta; Monda, Vincenzo; Villano, Ines] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Expt Med, Caserta, Italy;

The aim of this study was to compare the effect of dialectical behavior therapy and schema therapy on mood activity and suicidal thoughts in patients with borderline personality disorder in the city of Qazvin. Materials and methods: This study in terms of purpose is an applied one and in terms of the method of data collection, can be regarded as pre-experimental and post-experimental semi-experimental study with the control group. The study population included all patients with borderline personality disorder and mood activity and suicidal thoughts who referred to Bou-Ali Hospital in the city of Ghazvin. The sample consisted of 36 students, who were selected by convenience sampling. Of these, 24 patients were randomly divided into two groups, two experimental group including12 people, and a control group consisting 12 patients. In this study, The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory, The beck Depression Inventory and Scale suicide imagination Mach (SSIM) were used. Patients with the borderline personality disorder who belonged to the experimental group were under intervention for 16 section which takes long 90 minutes sessions in eight consecutive weeks under the controls. Research data was analyzed using multivariate and single factor analysis of covariance, and T-experimental was analyzed for the independent groups. Results: The results showed that there was a significant difference between dialectical behavior therapy and schema therapy with regard to their effect on mood activity and suicidal thoughts at (0.05>P). The results of the Independent t-experimental also showed that there was no significant difference between dialectical behavior therapy and schema therapy in patients with the borderline personality disorder in terms of the Suicidal thoughts variable at (0.05>P), but there was a significant difference between schema therapy and dialectical behavior therapy in patients with the borderline personality disorder in terms of the mood activity variable at (0.01>P). Discussion and conclusion: So, we could conclude that dialectical behavior therapy and schema therapy should be effective in reducing mood activity and suicidal thoughts in patients with borderline personality disorder.","[Mohamadizadeh, Ladan] Islamic Azad Univ, Khuzestan Sci & Res Branch, Dept Psychol, Ahvaz, Iran; [Makvandi, Behnam; Pasha, Reza; Bakhtiarpour, Saeid; Hafezi, Fariba] Islamic Azad Univ, Ahvaz Branch, Dept Psychol, Ahvaz, Iran","Makvandi, B (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Ahvaz Branch, Dept Psychol, Ahvaz, Iran.",,"makvandi, behnam/AAN-4246-2021","mohamadizadeh, ladan/0000-0001-6250-2709",,,"Abolghasemi A, 2012, J CLIN PSYCHOL, V42, P2; Aghayusefi A, 2015, Q J RES ADDICT, V9, P7; Alizadeh A, 2013, J PSYCHONURSE, V1, P6; American Psychiatric Association, 2000, DIAGNOSTIC STAT MAN; [Anonymous], 2001, PRACT GUID TREATM P; Arntz A, 2015, BEHAV RES THER, V74, P60, DOI 10.1016/j.brat.2015.09.00; Barlow DH, 2002, ABNORMAL PSYCHOL IN; Barnicot K, 2016, J BEHAV THER EXP PSY, V52, P147, DOI 10.1016/j.jbtep.2016.04.00; Beck A.T., 1996, BECK DEPRESSION INV; Beck AT, 1996, J PERS ASSESS, V67, P588, DOI 10.1207/s15327752jpa6703_1; Dickhaut V, 2014, J BEHAV THER EXP PSY, V45, P242, DOI 10.1016/j.jbtep.2013.11.00; Khajeh Mogehi N., THESI; Kianpoor M, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P149; Kiehn B, 2002, OVERVIEW DIALECTICA; Kroger C, 2010, J BEHAV THER EXP PSY, V41, P381, DOI 10.1016/j.jbtep.2010.04.00; Lynch TR, 2007, INT J GERIATR PSYCH, V22, P131, DOI 10.1002/gps.170; Miller PA, 2007, DIALECTICAL BEHAV T; Millon T, 1977, J PERSO ASSESSMENT, V68, P6; Millon T., 1994, MILLON CLINICALMULT; Mohan MR, 2009, INT J BUS PERFORM MA, V11, P1, DOI 10.1504/IJBPM.2009.02379; Moosaviasl SA, 2014, YASUJ UNI MED SCI J, V19, P8; Sempertegui GA, 2013, CLIN PSYCHOL REV, V33, P426, DOI 10.1016/j.cpr.2012.11.00; Soloff PH, 2000, PSYCHIAT CLIN N AM, V23, P169, DOI 10.1016/S0193-953X(05)70150-; Stepp SD, 2008, J PERS DISORD, V22, P549, DOI 10.1521/pedi.2008.22.6.54; Zamani N, 2014, SCI J ILAM U MED SCI, V20, P4; Zamani N, 2012, J HAMEDAN ISLAMIC AZ, V5, P12",26,4,4,0,25,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,1025.0,1031,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_162,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500021,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0026859504132231405,7.200916108002324e-15,0.011936210198615217,0.06223439478979819,0.011936210198615217

Diet food: intake of all nutrients was measured in weekly diary. The supplementation of chromium or zinc has been carried out - in a random way. Statistical analysis: Data are expressed as mean +/- SD or percentage changes from baseline. Results: Blood glucose trigger levels of our patients (especially the elderly) was closely linked to the intake of chromium with diet rather than to zinc intake. The effect of dietary supplementation of chromium based on the contribution of some foods has a beneficial effect on the glucose tolerance test (0.5 g glucose / kg body weight) (Fig. 1-A) and on the basal blood glucose levels (Fig. 1-B). In particular, the basal level of glucose in the serum decreases after 1 month of treatment, and this is still true after 6 months. Discussion: The effect of dietary chromium supplementation has a beneficial effect on the glucose tolerance test and fasting plasma glucose. The presence of zinc was less than chromium, but competes with the same chromium to the glucose tolerance test. The baseline serum glucose level decreases although it is still less than the amount detected in subjects treated with chromium. We can speculate that zinc and chromium may present a competitive effect on the absorption of insulin secretion and insulin receptor.","[Monda, Vincenzo; Monda, Giuseppe; Monda, Emanuele; Villano, Ines;

The evolutionary development of the arch of the foot was coincident with the greater demands placed on the foot as humans began to run. The movement and stability of the arch is controlled by intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. The aim of the present study was to investigate if a medical device (plantar), called RUGRAN, can enhance muscle rehabilitation in pain syndromes muscle-tendon for the correction and stabilization postural. The static pedobarographic evaluation revealed significantly higher values in terms of forefoot peak pressure, total plantar force and total contact area in subject without RUGARN plantar, compared to subjects with RUGARN plantar. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that analyzed the pedobarographic improvements in subjects with the RUGARN plantar. The static pedobarographic results observed while the subjects were standing revealed no difference of force distribution and contact area between forefoot and rearfoot and this finding did not support the hypothesis that the centre of the body shifts to forward because of excessive adipose tissue causing excessive forefoot loading.","[Monda, Vincenzo;

Motor activity plays a pivotal role in psychological, educational and social terms: sport practice induces harmonious physical development with common important benefits independently from sport type and each sport imposes rules respect that children learns to know and respect step by step improving the social skills and cognitive abilities. Sport has a very important role in the growth of children and adolescents. Sport and physical activity work as a moral laboratory to practice decision-making and problem-solving skills, as well as teamwork and cooperation. In many pathological conditions, the sport practice is strongly discouraged, as in epileptic patients for the negative consequences on their physical condition and psychic. In general, several studies reported that physical activity has positive influence on seizure frequency and severity. As a result, attitudes regarding sports and epilepsy have changed considerably in the last decades and presently, the risk of convulsive seizures during sports practice is minimal in case of well-managed epilepsy. Evaluating the control of convulsive disease is therefore a key point to allow sports in the children and adolescents.","[Monda, Vincenzo; Villano, Ines] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Sect Human Physiol, Dept Expt Med, Caserta, Italy;

Methods: A total of 1126 athletes were included in the study who applied to the Baltalimani Bone Diseases Hospital Sports Medicine Polyclinic between April 2015 and 2016. There were 17 different group of athletes. Vitamin D levels of the athletes were evaluated. Results: 39.7% of the participants were women while 60.3% were men. There was a significant difference in height and weight between the men and women in the study group (p=0.03 and p=0.00). Athletes were classified according to years of sport start. There was no statistically significant difference between groups in terms of vitamin D levels Although beginners had low levels of vitamin D, there was no significant difference (p=0.577) when compared to other groups. There was no statistically significant difference between ALP, P, Ca and PTH values according to years of sport start in females and males. Conclusion: In this study, even those who are engaged in long-lasting sports have not found enough vitamin D levels.","[Nayir, Tufan] Minist Hlth Turkey Republ, TR-06420 Ankara, Turkey; [Aydin, Canan Gonen] Baltalimani Bone Dis Training & Res Hosp, Sports Med Clin, Istanbul, Turkey; [Eroglu, Ali] Erenkoy Phys Therapy & Rehabil Hosp, Sports Med Clin, Istanbul, Turkey; [Tas, Suleyman Kasim] Baltalimani Bone Dis Training & Res Hosp, Orthoped & Traumatol Clin, Istanbul, Turkey","Nayir, T (corresponding author), Minist Hlth Turkey Republ, TR-06420 Ankara, Turkey.",,,,,,"Abboud M, 2014, J STEROID BIOCHEM, V144, P232, DOI 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2013.10.02; Al-Othman A, 2012, BMC PEDIATR, V12, DOI 10.1186/1471-2431-12-9; Association of Endocrinology and Metabolism in Turkey, 2015, GUID DIAGN TREATM M; Cashman Kevin D, 2007, Novartis Found Symp, V282, P12; Close GL, 2013, BRIT J SPORT MED, V47, P692, DOI 10.1136/bjsports-2012-09173; Constantini NW, 2010, CLIN J SPORT MED, V20, P368, DOI 10.1097/JSM.0b013e3181f207f; De Ronne N, 2013, J Pharm Belg, P1; Dong J, 2014, PERITON DIALYSIS INT, V34, P447, DOI 10.3747/pdi.2013.0000; Foo LH, 2009, J NUTR, V139, P1002, DOI 10.3945/jn.108.10205; Glerup H, 2000, CALCIFIED TISSUE INT, V66, P419, DOI 10.1007/s00223001008; Ha CD, 2013, MED SCI SPORT EXER, V45, P102, DOI 10.1249/MSS.0b013e31826c695; Halliday TM, 2011, MED SCI SPORT EXER, V43, P335, DOI 10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181eb9d4; Hamilton B, 2010, SCAND J MED SCI SPOR, V20, P182, DOI 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2009.01016.; Henderson A, 2005, JOGNN-J OBST GYN NEO, V34, P367, DOI 10.1177/088421750527615; Holick MF, 2007, NEW ENGL J MED, V357, P266, DOI 10.1056/NEJMra07055; Koenig J, 2000, INT J VITAM NUTR RES, V70, P214, DOI 10.1024/0300-9831.70.5.21; Lovell G, 2008, CLIN J SPORT MED, V18, P159, DOI 10.1097/JSM.0b013e3181650ee; Moreno LA, 2011, ANN NUTR METAB, V59, P22, DOI 10.1159/00033207; Morton JP, 2012, APPL PHYSIOL NUTR ME, V37, P798, DOI [10.1139/h2012-037, 10.1139/H2012-037; Muhairi SJ, 2013, BMC PUBLIC HEALTH, V13, DOI 10.1186/1471-2458-13-3; Ogan D, 2013, NUTRIENTS, V5, P1856, DOI 10.3390/nu506185; Ruohola JP, 2006, J BONE MINER RES, V21, P1483, DOI 10.1359/JBMR.06060; Shady Mones M Abu, 2015, Open Access Maced J Med Sci, V3, P80, DOI 10.3889/oamjms.2015.00; Valtuena J, 2014, NUTR HOSP, V30, P124, DOI 10.3305/nh.2014.30.1.753; Whiting SJ, 2011, AM J CLIN NUTR, V94, P128, DOI 10.3945/ajcn.111.01326; Willis KS, 2008, INT J SPORT NUTR EXE, V18, P204, DOI 10.1123/ijsnem.18.2.20",26,1,1,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,913.0,919,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_145,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500004,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0026859504132231405,1.1427453980394002e-20,0.005158885343493069,0.07211234029872984,0.005158885343493069

On the other hand, there is no difference between the incidence of mental disorders in children with PMNE and controls, although the psychological genesis could provide additional secondary forms, in which the child might react to stressful events with the resumption of involuntary urination at night, with a possible alteration of bowel control due to a high vulnerability to stressors. The purpose of this study is assessing the stressful events of life in a sample of children with PMNE. Materials and methods: 56 subjects with PMNE, (37 males and 19 females) (mean 10.87 years; SD +/- 1.68) were recruited consecutively. All subjects were evaluated for the presence of stressful events (ICU) with test Coddington Life Events Scales (CLES). The control group consists of 98 typically developing children (65 males, 33 females) (p = 0.855) (mean 11.3 years; SD +/- 1.85; p = 0.594). Results: Individuals with enuresis do not show a significant difference in the prevalence of stressful events than the control group (42.85% vs 41.83%; Chi-square = 0.002; p = 0,963) (table 1). Conclusions: These results for the first time show that PMNE can be regarded as an independent state by stress factors, suggesting that it itself represents a stress factor that can affect the proper psychological and neuropsychological development in children.","[Parisi, Lucia;

The areas concerned are mainly those related to social communication, social interaction and mutual functional and symbolic play. In the last decades, different conceptions of autism have taken, also emphasizing different sensory-perceptual abnormalities as the basis of the central features of disorder. This pilot study intends to address the issue of sensory perception in preschool children affected by ASD. Material and methods: 11 ASD children were enrolled (7 males, 4 female) aged between 2.3 years and 4.6 years, (mean age 3.29 +/- 0.72). The control group consisted of 24 typical developing children (15 males, 9 females) (mean age 3.08 +/- 0.87). All subjects underwent assessment of sensory perceptual abilities according to the Bogdashina's Sensory Profile Checklist Revised (SPCR) evaluation (43). Results: The two groups are comparable for age (p = 0.491) and sex distribution (p = 0.755). Table 1 shows the comparison between the two groups results in the SPCR, specifically, individuals with ASD, showed significantly higher scores on near all perception areas evaluated than healthy controls, suggesting a clear perceptual impairment in ASD subjects. Only for olfactory perception two groups were comparable. Conclusions: no significant differences in behavioral reaction to smell stimulation between ASD and typical developing children, and this result could be explained according to the early age of our sample that could cause high reactivity to smell stimulation also in typical developing examined children.","[Parisi, Lucia; Maltese, Agata; Di Folco, Annabella; Di Filippo, Teresa; Roccella, Michele] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Fortunato, Maria Rosaria] Univ Naples 2, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Dept Mental Hlth & Phys & Prevent Med, Naples, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, I-90133 Palermo, Italy","Roccella, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",,,,,,"Amjad RN, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P130; Bogdashina O., 2003, SENSORY PERCEPTUAL ; Carotenuto M, 2016, ACTA PAEDIATR, V105, P1079, DOI 10.1111/apa.1347; Carotenuto M, 2011, MINERVA PEDIATR, V63, P10; Carotenuto M, 2013, WORLD J PEDIATR, V9, P312, DOI 10.1007/s12519-013-0441-; Carotenuto M, 2013, NEUROL SCI, V34, P1905, DOI 10.1007/s10072-013-1403-; Carotenuto M, 2013, MED HYPOTHESES, V81, P306, DOI 10.1016/j.mehy.2013.04.02; Carotenuto M, 2013, SLEEP BREATH, V17, P93, DOI 10.1007/s11325-012-0654-; Carotenuto M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P157, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4189; Carotenuto M, 2012, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V8, P369, DOI [10.2147/NDT.S35974, 10.2147/NDT.535974; Di Filippo T, 2013, MINERVA PEDIATR, V65, P59; Esposito M, 2014, J INTELL DISABIL RES, V58, P421, DOI 10.1111/jir.1203; Esposito M, 2011, MINERVA PEDIATR, V63, P9; Esposito M, 2014, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V10, P1897, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S6979; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1803, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5385; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1513, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5271; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1351, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5155; Esposito Maria, 2013, Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat, V9, P1087, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4728; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1187, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5045; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1061, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4936; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P921, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4677; Esposito M, 2013, J HEADACHE PAIN, V14, DOI 10.1186/1129-2377-14-5; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P437, DOI [10.2147/NDT.543673, 10.2147/NDT.S43673; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P351, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4281; Esposito M, 2012, NEUROL SCI, V33, P1365, DOI 10.1007/s10072-012-1019-; Esposito M, 2012, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V8, P509, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S3686; Esposito M, 2012, EUR J PEDIATR, V171, P1599, DOI 10.1007/s00431-012-1759-; Esposito M, 2010, NEUROSCI LETT, V485, P89, DOI 10.1016/j.neulet.2010.08.06; Foumany GHE, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P135; Guzzetta A, 2010, DEV MED CHILD NEUROL, V52, P767, DOI 10.1111/j.1469-8749.2009.03497.; Messina A, 2016, FRONT NEURAL CIRCUIT, V10, DOI 10.3389/fncir.2016.0006; Messina Giovanni, 2016, Journal of Basic and Clinical Physiology and Pharmacology, V27, P611, DOI 10.1515/jbcpp-2015-013; Montalbano R, 2009, Minerva Pediatr, V61, P36; Morandi A, 2015, AM J MED GENET A, V167, P2720, DOI 10.1002/ajmg.a.3722; Narzisi A, 2011, GIOR NEUROPSICH ETA, V31, P21; Parisi L, 2015, MINERVA PEDIATR, V67, P36; Parisi L, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P1665, DOI [10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_147, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_; Parisi L, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P118; Parisi L, 2015, MENT ILLN, V7, P32, DOI 10.4081/mi.2015.598; Pasquali D, 2015, ENDOCRINE, V50, P797, DOI 10.1007/s12020-015-0564-; Perillo L, 2014, PATIENT PREFER ADHER, V8, P353, DOI 10.2147/PPA.S5897; Perillo L, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1231, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4998; Precenzano F, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P1755, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_15; Precenzano F, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P1761, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_16; Precenzano F, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P1749, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_15; Ruberto M, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P1659, DOI [10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_146, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_; Santamaria F, 2014, RESPIROLOGY, V19, P570, DOI 10.1111/resp.1227; Shams S, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P155; Vecchio D, 2011, MINERVA PEDIATR, V63, P34; Yongli Z, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P117",50,16,16,0,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,1.0,,,,,49.0,53,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_1_007,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2PY,WOS:000397226800007,,,,,2022-07-14,0.004235537190082644,0.07088746582436863,0.0007792902327700867,0.11066524905397217,0.0007915768557056947

Work-family conflict (WFC) results from the incompatibility between family demands and business/workplace needs. WFC can impact parental quality with many consequences on children health. Aim of study is assessing the prevalence of sleep disturbances in enuretic children, sons of work-shifters. Materials and methods: 80 children (67 males) aged 5-13 years (mean 10,43; SD +/- 1,99), were consecutively referred for PMNE. Sleep habits were investigated with Sleep Disturbances Scale for Children (SDSC) and the results were compared with a control group of 255 (190 males) typical developing children (TDC) sons of no shift-workers, matched for age (mean 10.57 SD +/- 1,89; p = 0.569) and sex distribution (Chi-square= 2.416; p = 0.120). Results: To evaluate statically differences among mean values of two samples, the Chi-square test was performed. Logistic regression was assessed to verify the role of paternal shift-working as risk factor for sleep disorders. p <= 0.05. All sleep disturbances categories were more prevalent in PMNE children sons of shift-workers than control group (Chi-square= 43.926; p<0.001); particularly 82.5% of PMNE vs. 11.76% of TDC show pathological scores for SBD category (Chi-square = 145.592; p<0.001; OR = 35,35; IC95% = 17.71-70.57); 61.25% vs 9.41% for SWTD (Chi-square = 93; p <0.001; OR = 15.213; IC95% = 8.21-28.15); 57.5% vs 9.41% for DA (Chi-square = 82.31; p < 0.001; OR = 13.02; IC95% = 7.06-23.98); 37.5% vs 6.67% for DIMS (Chi-square = 45.476; p < 0.001; OR = 8,4; IC95% = 4.3-16.39); 26.25% vs 5.88% for SHY (Chi-square = 24.257; p < 0.001; OR = 5.69; IC95% = 2,76-11,71) and 25%c vs 5.49% for DOES (Chi-square = 23.323; p < 0.001; OR = 5,73; IC95% = 2,73-12,01). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that paternal shif-working plus PMNE children may be a relevant factor affecting sleep quality in affected children.","[Parisi, Lucia; Maltese, Agata; Di Folco, Annabella; Di Filippo, Teresa; Roccella, Michele] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, Palermo, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] Univ Palermo, Dept PROSAMI, Palermo, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] CH Chinon, Childhood Psychiat Serv Neurodev Disorders, Chinon, France; [Romano, Palmira] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Mental Hlth & Phys & Prevent Med, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Caserta, Italy","Roccella, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy.",,,"TRIPI, Gabriele/0000-0001-7088-9325",,,"Alesi M, 2014, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V10, P479, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5845; Carotenuto M, 2016, ACTA PAEDIATR, V105, P1079, DOI 10.1111/apa.1347; Carotenuto M, 2011, MINERVA PEDIATR, V63, P10; Carotenuto M, 2010, MED HYPOTHESES, V75, P120, DOI 10.1016/j.mehy.2010.02.00; Carotenuto M, 2013, NEUROL SCI, V34, P1905, DOI 10.1007/s10072-013-1403-; Carotenuto M, 2013, MED HYPOTHESES, V81, P306, DOI 10.1016/j.mehy.2013.04.02; Carotenuto M, 2013, SLEEP BREATH, V17, P93, DOI 10.1007/s11325-012-0654-; Carotenuto M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P157, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4189; Carotenuto M, 2011, SLEEP BREATH, V15, P221, DOI 10.1007/s11325-010-0388-; Chieffi S, 2017, FRONT PHYSIOL, V8, DOI 10.3389/fphys.2017.0008; Di Filippo T, 2013, MINERVA PEDIATR, V65, P59; Di Filippo T, 2012, MENT ILLN, V4, P21, DOI 10.4081/mi.2012.e; Epifanio M.

Functional alterations in prefrontal cortex (PFC) may explain why OSAS impacts aspects such as: executive functions, memory, motor control, attention, visual-spatial skills, learning and mood regulation. Emotional intelligence (EI) is a complex neuropsychological function that could be impaired in many clinical conditions. Aim of the study is to evaluate the difference in emotional intelligence skills among children with OSAS and healthy subjects Materials and methods: 29 children (16 males) mean age 9.5 +/- 1.54 years, affected by OSAS were compared with 60 typical developing children similar for gender (p = 0,871), age (p = 0,934) and socio-economic status (p = 0.714). Bar-On emotional quotient inventory, youth version (EQ-i: YV) was used in order to assess the Emotional Quotient. Results: Apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) results to be 8.76 +/- 3.45 with medium desaturation index (ODI) amounting to 2: 52 +/- 21.5, average saturation 92.7 +/- 4.8 %, average desaturation 4.9 %. OSAS children have significant differences in Interpersonal scales (84.95 +/- 07.03 vs. 99.61 +/- 8.96; p <0.001), Adaptability (7: 36 +/- 79.61 vs. 101.32 +/- 9.4; p <0.001), Stress Management (72.48 +/- 8.14 vs. 98.44 +/- 5.19, p <0.001), QE Total (81.28 +/- 11.03 vs. 102.14 +/- 9.62; p <0.001). Pearson correlation analysis shows an inverse relationship between QE total and ODI (p <0.01). Conclusion: Our findings tend to highlight the role of intermittent hypoxia in OSAS effects genesis, involving also aspects different from physical impairments.","[Parisi, Lucia; Maltese, Agata; Di Folco, Annabella; Di Filippo, Teresa; Roccella, Michele] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, Palermo, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] Univ Palermo, Dept PROSAMI, Palermo, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] CH Chinon, Childhood Psychiat Serv Neurodev Disorders, Chinon, France; [Romano, Palmira] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Mental Hlth & Phys & Prevent Med, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Caserta, Italy; [Messina, Giovanni] Univ Foggia, Dept Expt Med, Sect Human Physiol, Foggia, Italy; [Messina, Giovanni] Univ Foggia, Unit Dietet & Sports Med, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Foggia, Italy","Roccella, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy.",,"Messina, Giovanni/AAE-8668-2022","Messina, Giovanni/0000-0002-0011-867X; TRIPI, Gabriele/0000-0001-7088-9325",,,"Alesi M, 2014, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V10, P479, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5845; Carotenuto M, 2016, ACTA PAEDIATR, V105, P1079, DOI 10.1111/apa.1347; Carotenuto M, 2011, MINERVA PEDIATR, V63, P10; Carotenuto M, 2010, MED HYPOTHESES, V75, P120, DOI 10.1016/j.mehy.2010.02.00; Carotenuto M, 2013, NEUROL SCI, V34, P1905, DOI 10.1007/s10072-013-1403-; Carotenuto M, 2013, MED HYPOTHESES, V81, P306, DOI 10.1016/j.mehy.2013.04.02; Carotenuto M, 2013, SLEEP BREATH, V17, P93, DOI 10.1007/s11325-012-0654-; Carotenuto M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P157, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4189; Carotenuto M, 2011, SLEEP BREATH, V15, P221, DOI 10.1007/s11325-010-0388-; Chieffi S, 2017, FRONT PHYSIOL, V8, DOI 10.3389/fphys.2017.0008; Di Filippo T, 2013, MINERVA PEDIATR, V65, P59; Di Filippo T, 2012, MENT ILLN, V4, P21, DOI 10.4081/mi.2012.e; Epifanio M.

In all neurodevelopmental disorders, we can observe autonomic alteration comprising sleep disorders, meal behaviour alteration and self-regulatory impairment. These alterations/impairment are very frequent in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (1-12). Aim of the present preliminary study is the assessment of metabolic rate in children affected by ASD. Material s and methods: 5 males affected by ASD aged 7-10 years (mean age 6.73 +/- 3:39), were recruited. The average score at the ADOS scale was 12.24 (SD +/- 3.29). The control group consisted of 5 males typically developing children (TDC) aged 7 to 11 years (mean age 7.92 +/- 3.23). Autonomic/Metabolic evaluation: Free-living daily physical activity was measured using either the SenseWear Armband in order to calculate the total energy expenditure (TEE), baseline (REE) and the metabolic physical activity for prolonged periods of time. In general, the SenseWear Armband allows objective monitoring of the lifestyle including duration and sleep efficiency. Results: ASD subjects show values of total energy expenditure (p = 0.0047) and active energy expenditure (p = 0.044) significantly higher compared to control subjects (Table 1). In addition, ASD children have a metabolic intermediate significantly higher than healthy subjects (p=0.015). (Table 1). Finally, the ASD children show a significant reduction of sleep time (p = 0.027) (Table 1). Conclusion: ASD can represents a very significant risk factor for developing sleep disorders and to high energy expenditure, although further studies are needed in this respect.","[Parisi, Lucia; Maltese, Agata; Di Folco, Annabella; Di Filippo, Teresa; Roccella, Michele] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, Palermo, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] Univ Palermo, Dept PROSAMI, Palermo, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] CH Chinon, Childhood Psychiat Serv Neurodev Disorders, St Benoit La Foret, France; [Romano, Palmira] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Mental Hlth & Phys & Prevent Med, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Caserta, Italy","Roccella, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy.",,,"TRIPI, Gabriele/0000-0001-7088-9325",,,"Alesi M, 2014, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V10, P479, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5845; Carotenuto M, 2016, ACTA PAEDIATR, V105, P1079, DOI 10.1111/apa.1347; Carotenuto M, 2011, MINERVA PEDIATR, V63, P10; Carotenuto M, 2010, MED HYPOTHESES, V75, P120, DOI 10.1016/j.mehy.2010.02.00; Carotenuto M, 2013, NEUROL SCI, V34, P1905, DOI 10.1007/s10072-013-1403-; Carotenuto M, 2013, MED HYPOTHESES, V81, P306, DOI 10.1016/j.mehy.2013.04.02; Carotenuto M, 2013, SLEEP BREATH, V17, P93, DOI 10.1007/s11325-012-0654-; Carotenuto M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P157, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4189; Carotenuto M, 2011, SLEEP BREATH, V15, P221, DOI 10.1007/s11325-010-0388-; Chieffi S, 2017, FRONT PHYSIOL, V8, DOI 10.3389/fphys.2017.0008; Di Filippo T, 2013, MINERVA PEDIATR, V65, P59; Di Filippo T, 2012, MENT ILLN, V4, P21, DOI 10.4081/mi.2012.e; Epifanio M.

Anxiety can be differentiated in state anxiety and trait anxiety. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a disorder most commonly caused by a triplet repeat expansion of >200 cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeats in the 50 untranslated region of the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Aim of the present study is investigating the state or trait anxiety in a sample of mothers of children affected by X-fragile. Materials and methods: 84 mothers (mean age 48.36 +/- 7.11) of children affected by FXS were recruited and compared with mother of 171 typical developing children (mean age 46.18 +/- 9.53). The Scale State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI) was used in order to assess the anxiety levels. Results: All mothers of children affected by FXS showed high score of anxiety levels at the STAI evaluation (Table 1), with no differences were found between mothers of males and females children affected. Conclusions: Mothers of children with FXS appear to be in a state of anxiety effects and suddenly even higher than those found later in mothers of children with other chronic diseases.","[Parisi, Lucia; Maltese, Agata; Di Folco, Annabella; Di Filippo, Teresa; Roccella, Michele] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, Palermo, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] Univ Palermo, Dept PROSAMI, Palermo, Italy; [Tripi, Gabriele] CH Chinon, Childhood Psychiat Serv Neurodev Disorders, St Benoit La Foret, France; [Romano, Palmira] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Mental Hlth & Phys & Prevent Med, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Caserta, Italy","Roccella, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy.",,,"TRIPI, Gabriele/0000-0001-7088-9325",,,"Alesi M, 2014, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V10, P479, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5845; Carotenuto M, 2016, ACTA PAEDIATR, V105, P1079, DOI 10.1111/apa.1347; Carotenuto M, 2011, MINERVA PEDIATR, V63, P10; Carotenuto M, 2010, MED HYPOTHESES, V75, P120, DOI 10.1016/j.mehy.2010.02.00; Carotenuto M, 2013, NEUROL SCI, V34, P1905, DOI 10.1007/s10072-013-1403-; Carotenuto M, 2013, MED HYPOTHESES, V81, P306, DOI 10.1016/j.mehy.2013.04.02; Carotenuto M, 2013, SLEEP BREATH, V17, P93, DOI 10.1007/s11325-012-0654-; Carotenuto M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P157, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4189; Carotenuto M, 2011, SLEEP BREATH, V15, P221, DOI 10.1007/s11325-010-0388-; Chieffi S, 2017, FRONT PHYSIOL, V8, DOI 10.3389/fphys.2017.0008; Di Filippo T, 2013, MINERVA PEDIATR, V65, P59; Di Filippo T, 2012, MENT ILLN, V4, P21, DOI 10.4081/mi.2012.e; Epifanio M.

The present study was performed to investigate the biochemical mechanism of wound healing activity of this plant in rats. After creating full-thickness skin wounds on the back of the rats, they were randomly divided into three groups. Two groups as the treated and positive control received the extract of EA and mupirocin ointment, respectively and other group as the control group, was not subjected to any treatments. Isolated tissues from wounds were harvested for 5, 10, and 15 days and were then underwent biochemical analysis. Healing activity was assessed by the rate of wound contraction and collagen content. The in vivo antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity was investigated to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. The concentration levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were determined in wound tissues by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a real-time RT-PCR. The results indicated a significant increase in the percentage of wound contraction and collagen content in the treated group, when compared with the control and positive control groups. Both mRNA and protein levels of the TNF-alpha were significantly reduced in the EA treated group. A significant decrease was also observed in Malondialdehyde and Myeloperoxidase content in the treated group compared to the control group. This study revealed that the EA extract accelerates cutaneous wound healing. This effect may confer its antioxidant and anti inflammatory activities. Therefore, EA extract may be useful in the current management of wound healing. ns.","[Pasalar, Parvin] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Fac Med, Keshavarz Blvd, Tehran, Iran","Pasalar, P (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Fac Med, Keshavarz Blvd, Tehran, Iran.",ppasalar@yahoo.com,"Dehpour, Ahmad Reza/I-6422-2019; Mehrabani Natanzi, Mahboobeh/O-3489-2017; Khodaii, Zohreh/S-4983-2017","Dehpour, Ahmad Reza/0000-0002-8001-5565; Kamalinejad, Mohammad/0000-0002-5946-4913; Mehrabani Natanzi, Mahboobeh/0000-0001-8879-5984; Tavangar, Seyed Mohammad/0000-0002-4253-2385; Khodaii, Zohreh/0000-0002-8858-1983",Tehran University of Medical Sciences [89-01-30-10456],The present study was financially supported by the Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Grant No. 89-01-30-10456).,"Abedi G, 2012, HEALTHMED, V6, P12; Abedi G, 2012, HEALTHMED, V6, P2; Ahmad SF, 2013, PHARM BIOL, V51, P411, DOI 10.3109/13880209.2012.73431; Al-Henhena N, HISTOLOGICAL STUDY ; [Anonymous], 2012, ASIAN PAC J TROP BIO, DOI DOI 10.1016/S2221-1691(12)60520-; Avecina A, 1991, GHANOON OF MED, V; Beigom Taheri Jamileh, 2010, J Dent Res Dent Clin Dent Prospects, V4, P2; BRADFORD MM, 1976, ANAL BIOCHEM, V72, P248, DOI 10.1016/0003-2697(76)90527-; Burgess C, 2008, J DRUGS DERMATOL, V7, pS; Charles CA, 2009, J AM ACAD DERMATOL, V60, P951, DOI 10.1016/j.jaad.2008.09.01; DEMBINSK.W, 1973, POL J PHARMACOL PHAR, V25, P59; Ehrlich HP, 2012, ADV WOUND CARE, V1, P3, DOI 10.1089/wound.2011.031; Garcia-Lafuente A, 2009, INFLAMM RES, V58, P537, DOI 10.1007/s00011-009-0037-; Goldberg MT, 2007, J INVEST DERMATOL, V127, P2645, DOI 10.1038/sj.jid.570089; Guo S, 2010, J DENT RES, V89, P219, DOI 10.1177/002203450935912; Kokane DD, 2009, J ETHNOPHARMACOL, V124, P311, DOI 10.1016/j.jep.2009.04.03; Li J, 2007, CLIN DERMATOL, V25, P9, DOI 10.1016/j.clindermatol.2006.09.00; Lim JS, 2010, J KOREAN MED SCI, V25, P746, DOI 10.3346/jkms.2010.25.5.74; Liu X, 2008, BIOCHEM J, V409, P289, DOI 10.1042/BJ2007054; Liza MS, 2010, FOOD BIOPROD PROCESS, V88, P319, DOI 10.1016/j.fbp.2009.02.00; Mori R, 2004, AM J PATHOL, V164, P1303, DOI 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63217-; Mori R, 2002, FASEB J, V16, P963, DOI 10.1096/fj.01-0776co; Natanzi M, 2012, ACTA MED IRANICA, V5; Nayak S, 2006, J BIOL SCI, V6, P5; Pandian C, EVALUATION WOUND HE; Rasekh H.

Few studies have explored the executive functioning in ASD preschoolers. The aim of this pilot study is the assessment of executive functioning in preschool children with ASD. Material and methods: 8 ASD children (7 males, 1 female) mean age 3.09 (SD +/- 0.83 years) were enrolled in the study and compared with a control group of 15 typically developing children (12 males, 3 females) (mean age 24.3 +/- 0.61). All subjects underwent assessment of executive functioning with the BRIEF-P test. Results: The two groups were matched for age (p = 0.625) and gender (p = 0.900). Table 1 shows the comparison between the two groups at the BRIEF-P, with significantly higher scores on all subscales of ASD children compared with controls. Conclusions: Despite the small sample examined the results of this study agree with what is already known in the literature confirm the presence of a significant deficit in executive functions of subjects with ASD emphasizing for the first time the emergence of such problems at an early stage of development, but demanding further studies to confirm this.","[Precenzano, Francesco;

In general, ASD is diagnosed at age three and many other frequent neurological signs may be present, such as sleep disorders. The aim of study is evaluating sleep habits in a sample of ASD children. Material and methods: The study population consists of 65 ASD children (43 males and 22 females), aged between 2 and 11 years (mean 5.73 +/- 2.39 years). The control group consists of 114 children with typical development (68 males and 46 females), aged between 3 and 10 years (mean 5.91 +/- 2.23 years). The diagnosis of ASD was confirmed by the evaluation ADOS -2, while the evaluation of sleep habits with the SDSC tests. Results: The two groups were matched for age (p = 0.633) and sex distribution (p = 0.483). The ASD subjects show a significantly higher rate of sleep disorders in all categories explored by SDSC tests (Table 1). Discussion: The sleep of people with ASD is compromised at any age and regardless of the severity of social impairment and communication, but not the level of development. Still, ASD is a very important risk factor for the development of sleep disorders, although the report could also be interpreted in the opposite manner.","[Precenzano, Francesco; Verde, Domenico; Romano, Palmira] Univ Naples 2, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Naples, Italy;

We hypothesized in the Hatha Yoga practitioners, reduced anxiety and a better tone of mood, superior performances in attentional tasks and, finally, more efficient attentive functions. Materials and methods: The research sample includes 26 women, of whom 13 (average age 39.07 years +/- 10.53 SD) practice Hatha Yoga (Yoga group) and 13 (average age 39.23 years +/- 13.45 SD) do not practicing any sport activities (Nsport group). The following psychological assessment tests were used: Profile of Mood States (POMS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y (STAI-Y) and Attention And Concentration Test (ACT). Results: Yoga group shows better control of internal tension states. None significant differences between the Yoga group and the Nsport group was observed by evaluating the anxiety, although in the Nsport group, State anxiety is associated with a lower sense of perceived energy, while in the Yoga group the State anxiety is related to a decrease of Depression. The Trait anxiety in Nsport group is associated with feelings of tension, fatigue, depression and aggression, with a consequent decrease in mood, whereas in the Yoga group none relationship between Trait anxiety and mood states was detected. Finally, concerning the sense of perceived energy, only the Yoga group showing performance improvement in the Attention and Concentration test. Conclusion. The practice of Hatha Yoga can be seen as a factor that can prevent and improve the quality of people's life, and although its effectiveness in treatment is still under investigation, it could be understood as a valid helper of classical treatments.","[Rinella, Sergio; Romeo, Rossella; Massimino, Simona] Univ Catania, Sect Physiol, Dept Biomed & Biotechnol Sci, Catania, Italy; [Di Corrado, Donatella] Kore Univ, Dept Human & Social Sci, Sch Sport Sci, Enna, Italy","Massimino, S (corresponding author), Univ Catania, Sect Physiol, Dept Biomed & Biotechnol Sci, Catania, Italy.",,"Di Corrado, Donatella/K-3757-2019; Rinella, Sergio/ADM-1130-2022; Di Corrado, Donatella/H-3726-2019; Rinella, Sergio/AAB-5946-2021","Rinella, Sergio/0000-0002-9368-7088; Di Corrado, Donatella/0000-0001-8223-6671; ",,,"Borella E, 2013, DETERIORAMENTO COGN; Bussing A, 2012, J EVID BASED COMPLE; Coco M, 2016, MEDICINE, V95, DOI 10.1097/MD.000000000000297; Coco M, 2015, MOL MED REP, V11, P2135, DOI 10.3892/mmr.2014.289; Coco M, 2014, SOMATOSENS MOT RES, V31, P35, DOI 10.3109/08990220.2013.83481; Coco M, 2013, SOMATOSENS MOT RES, V30, P90, DOI 10.3109/08990220.2013.76994; Coco M, 2011, MOL MED REP, V4, P471, DOI 10.3892/mmr.2011.45; Coco M, 2009, BRAIN RES, V1302, P205, DOI 10.1016/j.brainres.2009.09.03; Di Corrado D, 2014, MOL MED REP, V9, P2441, DOI 10.3892/mmr.2014.211; Di Nuovo S., 2013, ATTENZIONE CONCENTR; Donia M, 2012, ONCOL REP, V28, P682, DOI 10.3892/or.2012.184; Eysenck MW, 2007, EMOTION, V7, P336, DOI 10.1037/1528-3542.7.2.33; Eysenck MW, 2011, PERS INDIV DIFFER, V50, P955, DOI 10.1016/j.paid.2010.08.01; Fagone P, 2013, J NEUROIMMUNOL, V261, P82, DOI 10.1016/j.jneuroim.2013.04.01; Fagone P, 2013, BASIC CLIN PHARMACOL, V112, P63, DOI 10.1111/j.1742-7843.2012.00923.; Kabat-Zinn J, 1994, WHEREVER YOU GO THE; Kabat-Zinn J., 2013, FULL CATASTROPHE LI; Khalsa SBS, 2009, APPL PSYCHOPHYS BIOF, V34, P279, DOI 10.1007/s10484-009-9103-; Kozasa EH, 2012, NEUROIMAGE, V59, P745, DOI 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.06.08; Marchand WR, 2014, WORLD J RADIOL, V6, P471, DOI 10.4329/wjr.v6.i7.47; McCall Marcy C, 2014, Int J Yoga, V7, P4, DOI 10.4103/0973-6131.12347; McNair D.M., 1991, PROFILE MOOD STATE; Michalsen A, 2005, MED SCI MONITOR, V11, pCR55; Mijatovic S, 2010, FREE RADICAL BIO MED, V48, P1090, DOI 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2010.01.02; Perciavalle V, 2017, NEUROL SCI, V38, P451, DOI 10.1007/s10072-016-2790-; Perciavalle V, 2015, NEUROL SCI, V36, P2129, DOI 10.1007/s10072-015-2329-; Perciavalle V, 2015, NEUROL SCI, V36, P1597, DOI 10.1007/s10072-015-2210-; Perciavalle V, 2014, PERCEPT MOTOR SKILL, V118, P940, DOI 10.2466/19.50.PMS.118k27w; Perciavalle V, 2014, PERCEPT MOTOR SKILL, V118, P733, DOI 10.2466/29.30.PMS.118k22w; Perciavalle V, 2014, SOMATOSENS MOT RES, V31, P1, DOI 10.3109/08990220.2013.79692; Perciavalle V, 2013, MOL MED REP, V7, P1733, DOI 10.3892/mmr.2013.142; Sethi Jaspal Kaur, 2013, J Educ Health Promot, V2, P55, DOI 10.4103/2277-9531.11904; Sheela, 2013, Ayu, V34, P270, DOI 10.4103/0974-8520.12311; Spielberger CD., 1996, MANUAL STATE TRAIT ; Taneja Davendra Kumar, 2014, Indian J Community Med, V39, P68, DOI 10.4103/0970-0218.13271; Tang YY, 2007, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V104, P17152, DOI 10.1073/pnas.070767810; Tang YY, 2010, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V107, P15649, DOI 10.1073/pnas.101104310; Yoshihara K, 2014, BIOPSYCHOSOC MED, V8, DOI 10.1186/1751-0759-8-; Yoshihara K, 2011, BIOPSYCHOSOC MED, V5, DOI 10.1186/1751-0759-5-",39,0,0,1,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,1067.0,1072,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_169,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500028,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003822314049586777,7.312913851745544e-15,0.01728900147771377,0.062406116830955496,0.01736491642230858

Material and methods: Forty Sprague Dawley rats were divided into five groups. Group1 underwent only a right nephrectomy. Group 2 was administrated vinpocetine after right nephrectomy. Group 3 initially underwent a right nephrectomy. Them, left kidney of this group was applied ischemia for 60 minutes, which was followed by reperfusion for 24 hours. Group 4 underwent same steps as group 3; but was administrated vinpocetine 10 mg/kg i.p. before I/R to the left kidney. Similarly, group 5 underwent same steps as group 3 but was administrated vinpocetine 10 mg/kg i.p. after I/R to the left kidney. Results: Plasma BUN and creatinine showed no significant differences between control ( Sham) group and groups that were administrated vinpocetine. Decrease in plasma urea and creatinine was detected group 5, but this finding was not present in group 4. Superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase levels in groups 4 and 5 were significantly higher than the group 3. Parallel to this, oxidative stress index was higher in the group 3compared to groups 2, 4, and 5 (p<0.05). No significant difference was found between levels of malondialdehite in sham and vinpocetine administrated only group (p<0.005). All groups showed no differences in catalase levels and Total Antioxidant Capacity. Decreased tubular injury was present in the groups administrated vinpocetine before and after I/R. In control and vinpocetine given groups, there were some apoptosis in tubules after tested with caspase 3. Caspase 3 positivity was significantly higher in I/R group compared to control group. Vinpocetine if given after I/R was more effective to prevent apoptosis then to be administrated before I/R. Conclusion: This experimental study showed that vinpocetine promotes achieving better renal functions. The results of this study suggest that vinpocetine may be used in the treatment of renal I/R","[Sahin, Levent; Sarihan, M.

SA near eight months may be considered as an important and normal phase of the correct and typical social neurodevelopment. Aims of the present pilot study is assessing the prevalence of separation anxiety in a population of patients with migraine without aura (MwA). Materials and methods: 119 children (69 males) suffering from MwA (mean age 1.78 +/- 7: 59) were consecutively recruited. The control population consisted of 231 (114 males) healthy subjects similar for age (7.64 +/- 1: 34; p = 0.768) and gender (p = 0.987) The Screen for child anxiety related emotional disorders (SCARED) test was used to assess the prevalence of separation anxiety among MwA children.

Combinations of antibiotics acting by different mechanisms are used for the treatment of MDR bacterial infections. In this study we evaluated the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of colistin (CO), doripenem (DOR), tigecycline (TIG) alone and in vitro synergistic activity of CODOR, CO-TIG and DOR-TIG combinations against MDR A. baumannii strains isolated from patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Materials and methods: Thirty A. baumannii strains isolated from various clinical specimens of patients in ICUs were included in the study. The epsilometer test (E-test) method was used for determining the synergistic activity of different antibiotic combinations. Synergistic, additive, indifferent and antagonist effects of A. baumannii strains were evaluated by Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (FIC) index. Results: Of the 30 MDR A. baumannii strains tested, 90% were susceptible to TIG, 93.3% to CO and 50% to DOR. CO-DOR, CO-TIG and DOR-TIG combinations were found to have synergistic or additive effects against 3 (9.9%), 5 (16.6%) and 4 strains (13.3%), respectively. The synergistic or additive effect of DOR-TIG combination was 19.9% for DOR resistant strains and 6.6% for DOR susceptible strains. The synergistic or additive effect of CO-DOR combination was 19.9% for DOR resistant strains and 0% for DOR susceptible strains. Conclusion: Among the tested antimicrobial combinations, the combination of CO with TIG was most effective against MDR A. baumannii strains isolated from patients in ICUs. The synergistic or additive effects both for CO-DOR and DOR-TIG combinations were higher in DOR resistant strains. This study suggested that combination therapy with DOR for treating MDR A. baumannii infections should be used especially in DOR resistant strains.","[Sanal, Laser] YuksekIhtisas Training & Res Hosp, Microbiol Lab, TR-06420 Ankara, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Neziha] Bozok Univ, Microbiol Dept, Yozgat, Turkey; [Sen, Suha] Yuksek Ihtisas Training & Res Hosp, Infect Dis Dept, Ankara, Turkey; [Cesur, Salih] Ankara Numune Training & Res Hosp, Infect Dis Dept, Ankara, Turkey","Sanal, L (corresponding author), YuksekIhtisas Training & Res Hosp, Microbiol Lab, TR-06420 Ankara, Turkey.",,"yılmaz, neziha/AAH-3524-2020",,Yuksek Ihtisas Training and Research Hospital [322-1],"This study was presented as a poster presentation in the 7th Eurasia Congress of Infectious Diseases between 30 September and 3 October 2015 in Tbilisi, Georgia and 30th National Congress of Antibiotic and Chemotherapy at 6-10 May 2015 in TRNC (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus) and was supported by a grant from Yuksek Ihtisas Training and Research Hospital, Project no: 322-1.","Ahmed Nahid H, 2012, BMC Res Notes, V5, P215, DOI 10.1186/1756-0500-5-21; Aygencel G, 2010, YOGUN BAKIM DERGISI, V9, P16; Baadani AM, 2013, SAUDI MED J, V34, P24; Cai Y, 2012, J ANTIMICROB CHEMOTH, V67, P1607, DOI 10.1093/jac/dks08; Cekin Y, 2013, EUR J THER, V19, P185, DOI 10.5455/GMJ-30-2013-16; Cikman A, 2013, MIKROBIYOL BUL, V47, P14; CLSI Institute) LS, 2014, M100S24 CLS; Dent LL, 2010, BMC INFECT DIS, V10, DOI 10.1186/1471-2334-10-19; Dinc G, 2015, NEW MICROBIOL, V38, P6; Dizbay M, 2008, INT J ANTIMICROB AG, V32, P29, DOI 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2008.02.01; Dizbay M, 2010, J ANTIBIOT, V63, P51, DOI 10.1038/ja.2009.11; Falagas ME, 2005, CLIN INFECT DIS, V40, P1333, DOI 10.1086/42932; Fournier PE, 2006, CLIN INFECT DIS, V42, P692, DOI 10.1086/50020; Karabay O, 2014, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V30, P113; Karageorgopoulos DE, 2008, J ANTIMICROB CHEMOTH, V62, P45, DOI 10.1093/jac/dkn16; Karaoglan I, 2013, J INT MED RES, V41, P1830, DOI 10.1177/030006051349617; Lopez-Cortes LE, 2014, J ANTIMICROB CHEMOTH, V69, P3119, DOI 10.1093/jac/dku23; Maragakis LL, 2008, CLIN INFECT DIS, V46, P1254, DOI 10.1086/52919; Pachon-Ibanez ME, 2004, ANTIMICROB AGENTS CH, V48, P4479, DOI 10.1128/AAC.48.11.4479-4481.200; Principe L, 2009, ANN CLIN MICROB ANTI, V8, DOI 10.1186/1476-0711-8-1; Rossi F, 2016, BJID, V10, P20; Taskin G, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P1891, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_17; Tunyapanit W, 2014, SCIENCEASIA, V40, P28, DOI 10.2306/scienceasia1513-1874.2014.40.02; Vincent JL, 2009, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V302, P2323, DOI 10.1001/jama.2009.175; Zhang YJ, 2013, EXP THER MED, V5, P1737, DOI 10.3892/etm.2013.103",25,3,3,1,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,691.0,697,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_103,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700024,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0025826446280991736,1.0752393700144941e-23,0.014591283079411078,0.06499217811079555,0.014591283079411078

Such position is widely discussed and three among the most accepted criteria were submitted to comparison. Materials and methods: 55 subjects devoid of any evident motor dysfunction were receiving the test in the three selected feet positions configurations: Joined Parallel [JP], 30 degrees degrees with 5 cm heels apart [30 degrees], Parallel Apart [PA] at about 15 cm distance from each other. Six sequences have been selected and applied in a random way to the subjects in order to avoid learning effects or fatigue bias in the test results. Results: The data have demonstrated that: 1) The Romberg quotients (the ratio between homologous parameters calculated in the Closed Eyes Test vs. the Open Eyes Test), although affected by the feet position, keep their standard meaning independently by the feet position; 2) A significantly greater variability of Sway Parameters is afforded by the Joined Parallel Feet [JP] while the Parallel Apart Feet position [PA] seems to afford the lowest sensitivity in quantifying balance performances; 3) The [30 degrees] test seems to be the most comfortable one and therefore likely to be the most convenient for unstable or dysfunctional subjects that cannot keep the [JP] position; 4) The [PA] and the [30 degrees] test are showing very similar results. Conclusion: We can therefore conclude that the first choice for feet positioning to perform balance tests on force platform should be towards the Joined Parallel Feet, the others, however, might represent a valid choice for impaired patients.","[Scoppa, Fabio] Sapienza Univ Rome, Fac Med & Dent Surg, Masters Degree Course Posturol, Rome, Italy; [Scoppa, Fabio; Belloni, Gabriele] Chinesis IFOP, Osteopathy Sch, Rome, Italy; [Gallamini, Michele] Univ Palermo, Sport & Exercise Sci Res Unit, Palermo, Italy; [Messina, Giuseppe] Univ Palermo, Sport & Exercise Sci Res Unit, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, Palermo, Italy","Scoppa, F (corresponding author), Via Giovanni Pascoli 6, I-90144 Palermo, Italy.",,"Messina, Giuseppe/N-7298-2019","Messina, Giuseppe/0000-0003-2774-4950; Gallamini, Michele/0000-0002-4550-526X",,,"[Anonymous], NORM 85, V8; Baratto L, 2002, MOTOR CONTROL, V6, P246, DOI 10.1123/mcj.6.3.24; Baratto M, 2004, IMEKO IEEE SICE 2 I; Barela JA, 2011, RES DEV DISABIL, V32, P1814, DOI 10.1016/j.ridd.2011.03.01; Battaglia G, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P1589, DOI 10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_13; Bianco A, 2014, AGING CLIN EXP RES, V26, P147, DOI 10.1007/s40520-013-0144-; BIZZO G, 1985, MED BIOL ENG COMPUT, V23, P474, DOI 10.1007/BF0244893; Cakrt O, 2012, NEUROREHABILITATION, V31, P429, DOI 10.3233/NRE-2012-0081; Cappello A, 2004, MED BIOL ENG COMPUT, V42, P350, DOI 10.1007/BF0234471; Cappello A, 2011, GAIT POSTURE, V33, P724, DOI 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2011.02.00; Chiari L, 2002, CLIN BIOMECH, V17, P666, DOI 10.1016/S0268-0033(02)00107-; de Oliveira J.

It's a benign multicystic mass that is locally-destructive and rapidly expandable. The etiopathogenesis, even today, is not entirely clear. However, hemorragic fluid content and septated appearance are the characteristic feature of ABC. The clinical presentation produces symptoms due to the compression of adjacent structures or as a result of a pathological fracture and depends on localization.

Is particularly useful to identify the possible role played by a specific molecule to immunostimulant, Pidotimod, on restoring and optimizing physical performance in pediatric patients undergoing adeno-tonsillectomy surgery. Materials and methods: The study was performed on 600 patients, 275 males and 325 females, aged between 5 and 12 years, all subjected to adeno-tonsillectomy surgery. Group A: 300 patients treated with immunostimulant therapy (Pidotimod). Group B: 300 untreated patients with no therapy. The treatment of patients in the A group with Pidotimod provided for the administration of the drug, which started soon after hospitalization Parents of all patients provided a specific questionnaire The patient follow-up was divided into three phases: Phase T0: one week after the adeno-tonsillectomy intervention Phase T1: three months after the adeno-tonsillectomy intervention Phase T2: six months after the adeno-tonsillectomy operation. Results: The analysis of the obtained data revealed in its absolute evaluation the presence of a difference, somewhat evident, expressed in mean values, between the total score obtained in group A and that in group B. PHASE T0: The analysis of relative values, related to each single symptom, identified as the most prevalent phenomena, in descending order of frequency, dysphagia, odinophagia and asthenia PHASE T1: Reduction in the mean value of the mean score for the reference symptoms PHASE T2: Further decrease in the mean score for the reference symptoms in the two different groups Conclusions: The results of the study carried out, highlight the role that immunostimulants, specifically Pidotimod, can be used to optimize healing processes in pediatric patients undergoing adeno-tonsillectomy surgery.","[Serra, Agostino; Maiolino, Luigi; Campione, Gianluca; Conti, Angelo; Di Mauro, Paola] Univ Catania, ENT Dept, Catania, Italy","Maiolino, L (corresponding author), Univ Catania, ENT Dept, Azienda Osped Univ Policlin Vittorio Emanuele, Via Santa Sofia 78, I-95123 Catania, Italy.",,"Di Mauro, Paola/AAC-1502-2019",,,,"Alyanakian MA, 2006, DIABETES, V55, P179, DOI 10.2337/diabetes.55.1.17; Bousquet Jean, 2006, Paediatr Drugs, V8, P235, DOI 10.2165/00148581-200608040-0000; Bowman LM, 2001, INFECT IMMUN, V69, P3719, DOI 10.1128/IAI.69.6.3719-3727.200; Boyle P, 2000, BIODRUGS, V14, P389, DOI 10.2165/00063030-200014060-0000; COLLET JP, 1993, PEDIATR INFECT DIS J, V12, P648, DOI 10.1097/00006454-199308000-0000; GREGORY RL, 1986, REV INFECT DIS, V8, P20; Jara-Perez JV, 2000, CLIN THER, V22, P748, DOI 10.1016/S0149-2918(00)90008-; Navarro S, 2011, MUCOSAL IMMUNOL, V4, P53, DOI 10.1038/mi.2010.5; Ogawa K, 2000, SURGERY, V127, P329, DOI 10.1067/msy.2000.10349; Ogden NS, 2005, CURR OPIN ALLERGY CL, V5, P179, DOI 10.1097/01.all.0000162312.64308.f; Pauwels RA, 2004, LANCET, V364, P613, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16855-; Pavone P, 2014, INT J IMMUNOPATH PH, V27, P371, DOI 10.1177/03946320140270030; Rozy Adriana, 2008, Pneumonol Alergol Pol, V76, P35; Schaad UB, 2002, CHEST, V122, P2042, DOI 10.1378/chest.122.6.204; Slapak I, 1999, PEDIATR RES, V45, P757, DOI 10.1203/00006450-199905010-0011; TRINCHIERI G, 1994, IMMUNOL TODAY, V15, P460, DOI 10.1016/0167-5699(94)90189-; Vitaliti G, 2015, HUM VACC IMMUNOTHER, V11, P2749, DOI 10.1080/21645515.2015.106116; Williams BG, 2002, LANCET INFECT DIS, V2, P25, DOI 10.1016/S1473-3099(01)00170-; Zelle-Rieser C, CLINICALLY APPROVE",19,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,6.0,,,,,1045.0,1050,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_6_165,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FI4NW,WOS:000411949500024,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001962809917355372,1.1781706785030298e-11,0.003715742268983118,0.10222076728935446,0.003715742268983118

Methods: This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 48 patients with type 2 diabetes visiting the Diabetes Clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital in Zabol in Southeast of Iran from March to August 2016. They were divided into three groups, one of which received vitamin D supplement and routine treatments (A). The second group received vitamin D and calcium supplement and routine treatments (B). The third group received placebos and routine treatments (C). For a month, they were orally treated with 50000 units of vitamin D supplement and 150-250 milligrams of calcium on a daily basis. The HbA1c level and blood pressure were recorded before and after the intervention. Results: Blood pressure decreased after the intervention in the first and second groups; however, no significant decrease was observed in the third group (p=0.001) The HbA1c levels decreased by 1.76 and 1.85 in the first and second groups, respectively. An intragroup comparison, drawn after the intervention, indicated that HbA1c decreased in patients (28.08 -/+ 2 to 20.50 -/+ 2, p=0.122).

However, combining these lifestyle modifications may be more effective than either intervention alone. Therefore, We examined the effects of 8 weeks High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) with and without garlic supplement on some lipid profiles in obese inactive women. Method: The study used a 3-experimental group, pretest and posttest design with 40 obese women of mean age 35.9 +/- 1.7 years (BMI, more than 30) whom were purposefully selected and randomly divided into three experimental groups and control group. The first experimental group followed a 8-week training program on 3 days/week; the second one underwent on the same training program with garlic supplement intake simultaneously; the third group has just garlic supplement and a control group with no training and supplement. before taking primary and final blood samples, the 24-hour diet recall questionnaire was used to control the subject's diet the day before taking blood samples. Total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides were assessed by the enzymatic colorimetric method on an Architect C8000 system using the respective reagent kits. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald formula. Results: Improved lipid profiles were detected in the HIIT exercise and garlic complement in obese inactive women (p=0.05). The results indicated that garlic supplementation and exercise training improved all lipid profiles including TG, HDL, LDL, Chol/HDL and VLDL, while the combination of HIIT and garlic supplement may have more significant effect on lipid profiles (p=0.05). Conclusion: HIIT exercise and garlic complement improves the lipid profiles such including LDL, HDL, Cholesterol and Triglyceride in obese inactive women. It appears that HIIT exercise and garlic supplement may represent an effective approach for improving lipid profiles in obese inactive women individuals","[Taravati, Fatemeh] Islamic Azad Univ, Karaj Branch, Karaj, Iran; [Irandoust, Khadijeh] Imam Khomeini Int Univ, Karaj, Iran; [Rahimi, Alireza] Islamic Azad Univ, Karaj Branch, Dept Sport Physiol, Karaj, Iran","Irandoust, K (corresponding author), Imam Khomeini Int Univ, Karaj, Iran.",parirandoust@gmail.com,"irandoust, khadijeh/ABH-3519-2021; Taheri, Morteza/N-5170-2016","Taheri, Morteza/0000-0001-8031-3792",,,"Chhatwal S, 2012, INT J BASIC CLIN PHA, V1, P2; CHI MS, 1982, J NUTR, V112, P241, DOI 10.1093/jn/112.2.24; Christian DJ, 2010, SURG OBES RELAT DIS, V6, P448, DOI 10.1016/j.soard.2010.04.00; Couillard C, 2001, ARTERIOSCL THROM VAS, V21, P1226, DOI 10.1161/hq0701.09213; Finelli C, 2016, EXCLI J, V15, P166, DOI 10.17179/excli2015-64; FRIEDEWALD WT, 1972, CLIN CHEM, V18, P49; Guessogo WR, 2016, J EXERC REHABIL, V12, P90, DOI 10.12965/jer.1630502.25; Ho SS, 2012, BMC PUBLIC HEALTH, V12, DOI 10.1186/1471-2458-12-70; Lira FS, 2010, DIABETOL METAB SYNDR, V2, DOI 10.1186/1758-5996-2-3; Mathunjwa ML, 2013, ETHNIC DIS, V23, P14; Paoli A, 2012, J TRANSL MED, V10, DOI 10.1186/1479-5876-10-23; Rashidy-Pour A, 2009, OBES REV, V10, P2, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2008.00536.; Seip RL, 1998, EXERCISE SPORT SCI R, V26, P19; Wu T, 2009, OBES REV, V10, P313, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2008.00547.; Yeh YY, 2001, J NUTR, V131, p989S, DOI 10.1093/jn/131.3.989; Zorba E, 2011, J SPORT MED PHYS FIT, V51, P66",16,3,3,1,13,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,2.0,,,,,271.0,274,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_2_040,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EP2RK,WOS:000397230700015,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001652892561983471,1.36045021918225e-11,0.003096932184272161,0.08370154519278161,0.003096932184272161

Materials and methods: 58 patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis and 60 patients underwent surgery elective cholecystectomy have been included retrospectively this to case-control study. Groups compared according to age, gender, white blood cell count, mean platelet volume, platelet count, red blood cell distribution width, neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio and platelet / lymphocyte ratio. Results: Any significative difference hasn't been detected between the two groups in terms of age (p = 0.144; p> 0.05). In the control group, more male patients have been observed than acute cholecystitis group (p <0.05). Red blood cell distribution width, neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio, platelet / lymphocyte ratio values and leukocyte levels of the patients in the study group have been observed significantly higher than the control group (p <0.05). The parameter with the highest sensitivity and specificity was found as NLR. Conclusion: The highest sensitivity and specificity parameter is neutrofil-leukocyte ratio.

Platelets precursors megakaryocytes are shown to contribute to bone formation with osteoblasts. It was indicated that vitamin D, which also played an important role in bone remodeling, had receptors in many tissues as well as receptors in platelets, and these receptors decreased in osteoporosis. In this study we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the mean platelet volume (MPV), which shows platelets and platelet functions, and bone mineral density (BMD) and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in postmenopausal women. Material and methods: Three hundred sixty two postmenopausal women were included in this study. Their demographics, laboratory values and BMD were recorded. The subjects were divided into three groups as control, osteopenia and osteoporosis according to the results of BMD. MPV and platelet counts were investigated in these groups. Also correlation tests were performed to evaluate the relationship between platelet functions, vitamin D and BMD measurements. Results: There was no difference in MPV and platelet counts between groups. No significant correlation was determined between MPV and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. However, based on the findings of our study, we established that there was a significant correlation between the platelet count and lumbar spine (L1-4) T score. Conclusion: This study showed that there was no relationship between MPV and osteoporosis. MPV might be considered a less important indicator in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and osteoporosis.","[Vural, Meltem; Mert, Meral] Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Training Hosp, Istanbul, Turkey; [Erhan, Belgin; Gunduz, Berrin; Keles, Betul Yavuz; Erdem, Abdullah Eslem; Bozan, Ahmet] Istanbul Phys Med Rehabil Training Hosp, Istanbul, Turkey; [Arslan, Hulya] Yozgat Publ Hosp, Yozgat, Turkey","Vural, M (corresponding author), Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Training Hosp, Istanbul, Turkey.",,,,,,"Akbal A, 2014, OSTEOPOROSIS INT, V25, P2291, DOI 10.1007/s00198-014-2764-; Bath PMW, 1996, BLOOD COAGUL FIBRIN, V7, P157, DOI 10.1097/00001721-199603000-0001; Beeton CA, 2006, BONE, V39, P985, DOI 10.1016/j.bone.2006.06.00; Beilfuss J, 2012, CYTOKINE, V60, P870, DOI 10.1016/j.cyto.2012.07.03; Bonucci E, 2014, TOXICOL PATHOL, V42, P957, DOI 10.1177/019262331351242; Bord S, 2005, BONE, V36, P812, DOI 10.1016/j.bone.2004.12.00; Calvi LM, 2003, NATURE, V425, P841, DOI 10.1038/nature0204; Chappard D., 1999, Morphologie, V83, P1; Chu SG, 2010, J THROMB HAEMOST, V8, P148, DOI 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2009.03584.; Cure MC, 2014, ANN LAB MED, V34, P98, DOI 10.3343/alm.2014.34.2.9; D'Amelio P, 2012, PANMINERVA MED, V54, P22; Ferdous F, 2015, IMMUNOL LETT, V163, P32, DOI 10.1016/j.imlet.2014.11.01; Gasparyan AY, 2011, CURR PHARM DESIGN, V17, P4; Graham S, 2009, EXPERT OPIN INV DRUG, V18, P1633, DOI 10.1517/1354378090324160; Gur EB, 2015, ARCH ENDOCRIN METAB, V59, P448, DOI 10.1590/2359-399700000006; Jorgensen NR, 2012, J INTERN MED, V272, P385, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2012.02535.; Kebapcilar AG, 2013, ARCH GYNECOL OBSTET, V288, P207, DOI 10.1007/s00404-013-2735-; Kim HL, 2011, YONSEI MED J, V52, P739, DOI 10.3349/ymj.2011.52.5.73; Kiskac M, 2014, ANN ENDOCRINOL-PARIS, V75, P200, DOI 10.1016/j.ando.2014.07.11; Komori T, 1997, CELL, V89, P755, DOI 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80258-; Li XS, 2012, J BONE MINER METAB, V30, P660, DOI 10.1007/s00774-012-0362-; Linden MD, 2010, INT J BIOCHEM CELL B, V42, P1762, DOI 10.1016/j.biocel.2010.07.01; MANOLAGAS SC, 1995, NEW ENGL J MED, V332, P305, DOI 10.1056/NEJM19950202332050; Muscari A, 2009, THROMB RES, V123, P587, DOI 10.1016/j.thromres.2008.03.02; Osta B, 2014, FRONT IMMUNOL, V5, DOI 10.3389/fimmu.2014.0004; PFEILSCHIFTER J, 1990, ENDOCRINOLOGY, V127, P69, DOI 10.1210/endo-127-1-6; Raisz LG, 2005, J CLIN INVEST, V115, P3318, DOI 10.1172/JCI2707; Seida JC, 2014, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V99, P3551, DOI 10.1210/jc.2014-213; Sharif Pooneh Salari, 2010, Inflammation & Allergy Drug Targets, V9, P39; Shih TTF, 2004, SPINE, V29, P2844, DOI 10.1097/01.brs.0000147803.01224.5; Syberg S, 2012, J BONE MINER RES, V27, P2373, DOI 10.1002/jbmr.169; Vestergaard P, 2012, INT J CARDIOL, V160, P36, DOI 10.1016/j.ijcard.2011.03.02; Wang RT, 2011, PLATELETS, V22, P447, DOI 10.3109/09537104.2011.56543",33,5,5,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,3.0,,,,,443.0,448,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_3_065,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EV3BF,WOS:000401631200013,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003409090909090909,1.714227197430297e-20,0.04119056421886354,0.0739422364471061,0.04119056421886354

Methods: The author selected 3450 cases of athlete injured in Wushu routine movements between January 2014 and January 2016. Documentary analysis, logical analysis and expert interviews were used to analyze the biomechanical principles of the knee joint injury in athletes. Then based on the results, future rehabilitation measures are proposed. Results: Wushu athletes' landing in tornado kick turn 720 degrees to horse step can cause serious damage to the knee, as huge impact will be created by the moment during landing. At the same time, the weight of Wushu athletes as well as height of the arch will exert huge impact on athletes' knee joint. Conclusion: During tornado kick turn 720 degrees to horse step landing, Wushu athletes should pay more attention to the serious force generated by the movement and try to slow down landing time in order to reduce the impact. This will effectively protect the athletes' knee joint and keep the athletes healthy, which is important in the Wushu athletes' career.","[Wang, Hui; Ge, Zhiqiang; Wu, Jiwei; Yang, Jie] Jizhong Energy Grp, Fengfeng Gen Hosp, Dept Orthoped, Handan 056002, Peoples R China","Yang, J (corresponding author), Jizhong Energy Grp, Fengfeng Gen Hosp, Dept Orthoped, Handan 056002, Peoples R China.",opq007007@126.com,,,,,"Chen GM, 2016, SAUDI PHARM J, V24, P250, DOI 10.1016/j.jsps.2016.04.00; Deng Xiaofeng, 2014, ZHEJIANG SPORT SCI, V23, P12; Gao W, 2017, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V24, P132, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2016.09.00; Hu Pingxiu, 2010, WUSHU SCI, V21, P5; Kumar R, 2016, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V23, P243, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2015.03.00; Li Zhonghua, 2011, WUSHU SCI, V1; Peng Liming, 2010, WUSHU SCI, V26, P4; Peng WX, 2017, SAUDI J BIOL SCI, V24, P103, DOI 10.1016/j.sjbs.2016.08.01; Sheng Yancha, 2013, WUSHU SCI, V; Wang Dongmei, 2015, J BEIJING SPORT U, V14, P13; Wang Sen, 2014, J TIANJIN U SPORT, V16, P17; Xu Man, 2012, ZHEJIANG SPORT SCI, V13, P12; Yang Jiapeng, 2012, SPORT SCI TECHNOLOGY, V5, P6; Zhang Yanhua, 2014, WUSHU SCI, V05, P6",14,0,0,4,17,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,,,,3.0,,1297.0,1300,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_3s_199,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FV9AC,WOS:000424878100001,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001446280991735537,1.1351005055601526e-06,0.0022805219820586694,0.08464276033332459,0.002279399231117796

This study aimed to investigate the role of self-management in the blood glucose control of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and explore the relationship of self-management with risk factors of chronic complications of T2DM. Materials and methods: a survey was conducted in 900 DM patients in the Huamu Community Health Center in Shanghai in Deptember 2014, and the individual background, past medical history, self-management of DM were collected. Moreover, these patients received physical examination and laboratory examination. Results: excise and medication in self-management were negatively related to glycated hemoglobin (P<0.05), special diet and excise in self-management were negatively associated with systolic blood pressure (P<0.05), and general diet and excise in selfmanagement were negatively related to urinary microalbumin to creatinine ratio (P<0.05). The self-management has no relationship with total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterin. Logistic regression analysis showed good excise (OR 0.929, 95% CI 0.877-0.983) and medication (OR 0.932, 95% CI 0.886-0.981) in self-management were helpful for the normalization of blood glucose, and good excise was able to reduce the risk for microalbuminuria (OR 0.918, 95% CI 0.861-0.979). Conclusion: the effective self-management of DM desires to be generalized in clinical practice. To improve the self-management in T2DM patients is helpful to control blood glucose and blood pressure and delay the microalbuminuria progression.","[Wang, Yakun] Huamu Community Hlth Ctr Shanghai Pudong New Area, Shanghai 201204, Peoples R China; [Fang, Ningyuan] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Renji Hosp, Dept Geriatr, Shanghai 200127, Peoples R China","Fang, NY (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Renji Hosp, Dept Geriatr, Shanghai 200127, Peoples R China.",,,,Outstanding Young Medical Talent Project of Health System in Shanghai Pudong New Area [PWRq2014-25],This study was supported by Outstanding Young Medical Talent Project of Health System in Shanghai Pudong New Area (PWRq2014-25).,"Amer Diabet Assoc, 2013, DIABETES CARE, V36, P1033, DOI 10.2337/dc12-262; Amer Diabet Assoc, 2010, DIABETES CARE, V33, pS11, DOI 10.2337/dc10-S01; Emdin CA, 2015, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V313, P603, DOI 10.1001/jama.2014.1857; Gay HC, 2016, HYPERTENSION, V67, P733, DOI 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.0685; Heisler M, 2005, DIABETES CARE, V28, P816, DOI 10.2337/diacare.28.4.81; Houle J, 2015, DIABETIC MED, V32, P1247, DOI 10.1111/dme.1268; Litwak L, 2013, DIABETOL METAB SYNDR, V5, DOI 10.1186/1758-5996-5-5; Nicoll Katie G, 2014, Diabetes Spectr, V27, P207, DOI 10.2337/diaspect.27.3.20; Patel A, 2008, NEW ENGL J MED, V358, P2560, DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa080298; Stratton IM, 2000, BMJ-BRIT MED J, V321, P405, DOI 10.1136/bmj.321.7258.40; Toobert DJ, 2000, DIABETES CARE, V23, P943, DOI 10.2337/diacare.23.7.94; Wang YK, 2013, INT J CLIN EXP MED, V6, P97; Wong ND, 2016, DIABETES CARE, V39, P668, DOI 10.2337/dc15-243; Yang SN, 2016, PLOS ONE, V11, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.015075",14,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,5.0,,,,,751.0,756,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_5_110,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,FA9PC,WOS:000405777000004,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001446280991735537,7.051009219729465e-08,0.014614756324203835,0.11320181029341254,0.013816858522944018

Its incidence, 5 years after treatment, is 0.03-0.2%. This risk is related to radiation dose, concomitant alkylating agents and genetic factors. Case presentation: We report the case of a 33-year-old woman with synchronous gastric (adenocarcinoma, intestinal type, T3N2M0, Stage 3A) and right-sided breast cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), T2N1M0, Cerb2 (+++), Stage 2B) who received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) and radiotherapy (RT) to stomach and breast. At the 22nd month after RT, pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma was diagnosed at the right thoracic wall including axillary region (field of RT) synchronously with the left sided breast cancer. After adjuvant CT, first she received chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) for gastric cancer. After that she received complex RT to breast region (right supraclavicular fossa single front plan, tangential fields bolus), a total of 5000 cGy as 200 cGy/day X 25 fractions to right chest wall and a total dose as 5000 cGy to posterior axillary region. During follow-up, a 3 cm lesion at right axilla and a BIRADS 4A lesion in her left breast were determined. Sarcoma in right axilla and IDC in left breast were reported after biopsy. Patient underwent surgery at the same session. Conclusion: Although post-radiation sarcomas are rare complications with poor prognosis, enhanced awareness and early detection by clinicians are essential to improve outcomes via curative surgical resection. Latent period is expressed with years, but in our case RIS was developed after a short time with 22 months.","[Yildirim, Nilgun] Dr Ersin Arslan Training & Res Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Gaziantep, Turkey; [Simsek, Melih; Turkeli, Mehmet; Bilici, Mehmet] Ataturk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Oncol, Erzurum, Turkey; [Ozmen, Hilal Kiziltunc] Ataturk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Radiat Oncol, Erzurum, Turkey","Yildirim, N (corresponding author), Dr Ersin Arslan Training & Res Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Gaziantep, Turkey.",,"yıldırım, Nilgün/W-1484-2018; Kiziltunc Ozmen, Hilal/AAZ-7566-2021; Kiziltunc Ozmen, Hilal/AAZ-8355-2021","Kiziltunc Ozmen, Hilal/0000-0003-0695-0931; ",,,"Beck A., 1992, MUNCHEN MED WOCHEN, V69, P62; Cahan WG, 1998, CANCER-AM CANCER SOC, V82, P8, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19980101)82:1<8::AID-CNCR3>3.0.CO;2-; Fletcher CDM, 2006, HISTOPATHOLOGY, V48, P3, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2559.2005.02284.; Gonin-Laurent N, 2007, ONCOGENE, V26, P6106, DOI 10.1038/sj.onc.121040; Henderson TO, 2007, JNCI-J NATL CANCER I, V99, P300, DOI 10.1093/jnci/djk05; Jallali N, 2012, AM J SURG, V203, P156, DOI 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2010.12.01; Kadouri L, 2013, BREAST CANCER RES TR, V140, P207, DOI 10.1007/s10549-013-2621-; Lagrange JL, 2000, RADIOLOGY, V216, P197, DOI 10.1148/radiology.216.1.r00jl0219; MARK RJ, 1994, CANCER, V73, P2653, DOI 10.1002/1097-0142(19940515)73:10<2653::AID-CNCR2820731030>3.0.CO;2-; Patel S R, 2000, Curr Treat Options Oncol, V1, P258, DOI 10.1007/s11864-000-0037-; Riad S, 2012, CANCER-AM CANCER SOC, V118, P2682, DOI 10.1002/cncr.2654; Rubino C, 2005, BREAST CANCER RES TR, V89, P277, DOI 10.1007/s10549-004-2472-; Sheth GR, 2012, ONCOLOGIST, V17, P405, DOI 10.1634/theoncologist.2011-028; Torres KE, 2013, ANN SURG ONCOL, V20, P1267, DOI 10.1245/s10434-012-2755-; TUCKER MA, 1987, NEW ENGL J MED, V317, P588, DOI 10.1056/NEJM19870903317100; Warren S, 1936, ARCH SURG-CHICAGO, V33, P425, DOI 10.1001/archsurg.1936.0119003007800; West JG, 2008, CLIN BREAST CANCER, V8, P533, DOI 10.3816/CBC.2008.n.06; Yap J, 2002, INT J RADIAT ONCOL, V52, P1231, DOI 10.1016/S0360-3016(01)02799-",18,3,3,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2017,33,4.0,,,,,565.0,568,,10.19193/0393-6384_2017_4_082,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EX2TM,WOS:000403079700003,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001962809917355372,1.8634729387996942e-08,0.003715742268983118,0.12773987516330382,0.003715742268983118

Both kidneys are evaluated with B Mode Ultrasound and Colour Doppler Ultrasound mode by measuring resistive index for depiction of other renal pathologies. Stiffness of renal tissue determined by Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) technology utilized by two blinded radiology specialists. Results: We were not able to find any correlation between gestational diabetes mellitus and resistivity index measurements (p > 0.05).

The aim of this study was to determine prevalence of prehypertension and its association with neck and abdominal obesity in disease-free young adults. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in an urban public university of Turkey. The anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were obtained from 704 healthy disease-free young adults. Comparisons among blood pressure groups were done with the Chi-square test. Multivariate regression analysis was carried out to determine risk factors for prehypertension. The Pearson correlation was employed to determine correlation between the prehypertension and anthropometric measurements. P<0.05 values were considered as statistically significant. Results: The overall prevalence of prehypertension was 49.0%, 53.1% in males and 44.9% in females. Prevalence of prehypertension was significantly higher in males comparison to females (p<0.001). The overall prevalence of neck obesity, abdominal obesity and overweight/obesity was 18.2%, 6.1% and 23.0% respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that neck circumference was the strongest predictor of prehypertension among other obesity indicators. Prehypertension was positively correlated with neck circumference, waist circumference and Body Mass Index for both sexes (p<0.05). Conclusion: Public health interventions are needed to prevent prehypertension and obesity in young adults. Further research should focus on determining prehypertension, neck and abdominal obesity which will decrease probable cardiovascular risks in young populations.","[Yilmazel, Guelay] Hitit Univ, Sch Hlth, Dept Publ Hlth, TR-19000 Corum, Turkey","Yilmazel, G (corresponding author), Hitit Univ, Sch Hlth, Dept Publ Hlth, TR-19000 Corum, Turkey.",,"YILMAZEL, GÜLAY/AAF-1762-2020; YILMAZEL, GÜLAY/AAC-5444-2021; YILMAZEL, Gulay/H-9788-2014","YILMAZEL, GÜLAY/0000-0002-2487-5464; ",,,"Al-Majed HT, 2012, J FAM COMMUNITY MED, V19, P105, DOI 10.4103/2230-8229.9829; Ben-Noun L, 2001, OBES RES, V9, P470, DOI 10.1038/oby.2001.6; Ben-Noun Liubov Louba, 2006, Exp Clin Cardiol, V11, P1; Celik MM, 2012, M KEMAL U MED J, V3, P; Chobanian AV, 2003, HYPERTENSION, V42, P1206, DOI 10.1161/01.HYP.0000107251.49515.c; Erem C, 2009, J PUBLIC HEALTH-UK, V31, P47, DOI 10.1093/pubmed/fdn07; Grotto I, 2006, HYPERTENSION, V48, P254, DOI 10.1161/01.HYP.0000227507.69230.f; Gupta AK, 2010, HYPERTENS RES, V33, P905, DOI 10.1038/hr.2010.9; Hu YH, 2011, J INT MED RES, V39, P23, DOI 10.1177/14732300110390010; Kawamoto R, 2008, TOHOKU J EXP MED, V216, P353, DOI 10.1620/tjem.216.35; Kini S, 2016, PLOS ONE, V11, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.015453; Lim SS, 2012, LANCET, V380, P2224, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61766-; Lu X, 2013, BMC PUBLIC HEALTH, V13, DOI 10.1186/1471-2458-13-2; Mendis S., 2011, GLOBAL ATLAS CARDIO; Piro S, 2008, NUTR METAB CARDIOVAS, V18, P96, DOI 10.1016/j.numecd.2007.01.00; Satman I, TURK DIYAB HIP OB E; Stojiljkovic MP, 2002, J HYPERTENS, V20, P1215, DOI 10.1097/00004872-200206000-0003; Stojiljkovic MP, 2001, AM J PHYSIOL-REG I, V280, pR1674, DOI 10.1152/ajpregu.2001.280.6.R167; T.

Tokyo guidelines provide criteria for the diagnosis and classification of AC. We aimed this study to identify the role of C-reactive protein (CRP) in determining the severity of AC and determine cut-off levels for each group. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis was made of 236 patients diagnosed with AC between January 2009 and January 2015. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Tokyo classification. CRP values of the patients were analyzed and compared among the groups. Results: Disease severity was determined as mild in 57.6%, moderate in 28.8% and severe in 13.6% of the patients. The mean age was 53.7 +/- 18.3 years and the clinical picture was seen to become more severe with increasing age (p<0.05). CRP values of the patients were determined to rise with increasing grade (p<0.05). There was no relationship between CRP and white blood cell (WBC) (p>0.05). The CRP cut-off values were determined as 0.815 mg/dl (sensitivity 44.9%, specificity 34%) for the Grade 1 patient group, 1.095 mg/dl (sensitivity 57.4%, specificity 57.7%) for the Grade 2 patient group and 2.095 mg/dl (sensitivity 71.9%, specificity 69.6%) for the Grade 3 patient group. Conclusion: CRP values may be useful in assessing the severity of AC, and may be considered to be a parameter that could be added to the Tokyo classification.","[Yuzbasioglu, Yucel; Ucoz, Dilber; Icme, Ferhat] Ankara Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Ankara, Turkey; [Haydar, Gullu Ercan; Pekcici, Recep] Ankara Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Ankara, Turkey; [Uzunosmanoglu, Huseyin] Ankara Kecioren Training & Res Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Ankara, Turkey","Icme, F (corresponding author), Ankara Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Clin Emergency Med, Ataturk Egitim & Arastirma Hastanesi Acil, Serv Bilkent, Eskisehir Yolu 2 Km, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",,"İÇME, Doç.

Materials and methods: The biochemical values of 204 patients under chemotherapy evaluation were obtained retrospectively from archive data. Albumin-globulin ratio values were calculated using albumin/total protein-albumin formula. The values of albumin-globulin ratio and albumin were categorized as 3 groups using receiver operating characteristic analysis and a descending order. Results: The calculated cut-off value for albumin-globulin ratio was 1.14: 34.4-79.7 by receiver operating characteristic. The median survival was 20.7 months (15.9-25.5), 20.1 months (15.1-25.1), 16 months (11.8-20.1), respectively in 1st, 2nd, 3rd groups for albumin-globulin ratio (p=0.46). The median overall survival was 18.3 months (123-24.2), 21.6 months (16.8-26.3), 18.01 months (13.5-22.4) in 1st, 2nd, 3rd groups for albumin, respectively (p=0.52). There were no statistical significant differences by Kaplan-Meier method for albumin-globulin ratio, albumin p>0.05. The effects of clinicopathological and biochemical characteristics on mortality were assessed by Cox-proportional hazard regression analysis. The independent predictors of mortality were observed high grade, the presence of perineural invasion of the tumor, high nodal involvement (p:0.01, p:0.001, p:0.01), respectively. Conclusion: Albumin-globulin ratio and albumin values alone may not be useful parameters to predict mortality and survival in patients with gastric carcinoma.","[Aksoy, Asude] Firat Univ, Fac Med, Med Oncol, Elazig, Turkey; [Durak, Serdar; Koca, Suleyman Serdar] Firat Univ, Med Fac Internal Med, Elazig, Turkey; [Ozturk, Turkan] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Fac Med, Med Oncol, Trabzon, Turkey; [Avci, Nilufer] Bursa Ali Osman Sonmez Oncol Hosp, Med Oncol, Bursa, Turkey; [Cirak, Yalcin] Istanbul Bahcesehir Univ, Fac Med, Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Deger, Ayse Nur] Dumlupinar Univ, Fac Med, Pathol, Kutahya, Turkey; [Bilgic, Yilmaz] Inonu Univ, Fac Med, Gastroenterol, Malatya, Turkey; [Ozcan, Mete] Firat Univ, Fac Med, Biophys, Malatya, Turkey; [Goktas, Sevil] Denizli State Hosp, Med Oncol, Denizli, Turkey; [Bozdag, Ahmet] Elazig Educ & Res Hosp, Gen Surg, Elazig, Turkey","Aksoy, A (corresponding author), Firat Univ, Fac Med, Med Oncol, Elazig, Turkey.",,"Bozdag, Ahmet/C-6418-2018; bilgic, yılmaz/ABI-6432-2020; Ozcan, Mete/V-8758-2018","Bozdag, Ahmet/0000-0003-1973-2511; bilgic, yılmaz/0000-0002-2169-5548; Ozcan, Mete/0000-0002-5551-4880; aksoy, asude/0000-0002-5609-9658; Durak, Serdar/0000-0002-8175-9611",,,"Alici S, 2006, MED SCI MONITOR, V12, pCR22; Azab B, 2014, CANCER BIOMARK, V14, P303, DOI 10.3233/CBM-14041; Azab BN, 2013, AM J SURG, V206, P764, DOI 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2013.03.00; Barber MD, 1999, NUTR CANCER, V35, P106, DOI 10.1207/S15327914NC352_; Chen K, 2013, WORLD J SURG ONCOL, V11, DOI 10.1186/1477-7819-11-18; Das Undurti N., 2014, AM J SURG, V208, P15; Di Fiore F, 2007, AM J GASTROENTEROL, V102, P2557, DOI 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2007.01437.; Dixon MR, 2003, ARCH SURG-CHICAGO, V138, P962, DOI 10.1001/archsurg.138.9.96; Du XJ, 2014, PLOS ONE, V9, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.009447; Duran AO, 2014, ASIAN PAC J CANCER P, V15, P6449, DOI 10.7314/APJCP.2014.15.15.644; Farhan-Alanie OM, 2015, BRIT J ORAL MAX SURG, V53, P126, DOI 10.1016/j.bjoms.2014.10.00; Forones NM, 2001, HEPATO-GASTROENTEROL, V48, P119; Gao YY, 2014, J CANCER RES THER, V10, P799, DOI 10.4103/0973-1482.14605; Gaspar MJ, 2001, TUMOR BIOL, V22, P318, DOI 10.1159/00005063; Goldwasser P, 1997, J CLIN EPIDEMIOL, V50, P693, DOI 10.1016/S0895-4356(97)00015-; Gospodarowicz M, 2001, CANCER, V91, P186; Kanat O, 2013, TUMORI J, V99, P229, DOI 10.1700/1283.1419; KNAUS WA, 1991, CHEST, V100, P1619, DOI 10.1378/chest.100.6.161; Koike Y, 2003, HEPATO-GASTROENTEROL, V50, P203; Li QQ, 2014, ASIAN PAC J CANCER P, V15, P945, DOI 10.7314/APJCP.2014.15.2.94; Liu XC, 2015, TRANSL ONCOL, V8, P339, DOI 10.1016/j.tranon.2015.06.00; McMillan DC, 2009, CURR OPIN CLIN NUTR, V12, P223, DOI 10.1097/MCO.0b013e32832a790; Okamura T, 2004, J CLIN EPIDEMIOL, V57, P1188, DOI 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2004.02.01; Onate-Ocana L F, 1999, Rev Gastroenterol Mex, V64, P11; Ray P, 1998, CANCER DETECT PREV, V22, P293, DOI 10.1046/j.1525-1500.1998.CDOA43.; Ryu JW, 2003, J KOREAN MED SCI, V18, P505, DOI 10.3346/jkms.2003.18.4.50; Shimada H, 2003, J SURG ONCOL, V83, P248, DOI 10.1002/jso.1027; Tateishi R, 2005, GUT, V54, P419, DOI 10.1136/gut.2003.03505; Torre LA, 2015, CA-CANCER J CLIN, V65, P87, DOI 10.3322/caac.2126; WOBBES T, 1992, CANCER, V69, P2036, DOI 10.1002/1097-0142(19920415)69:8<2036::AID-CNCR2820690805>3.0.CO;2-",30,3,3,2,14,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,707.0,712,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_78,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400007,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003202479338842975,1.877520223674976e-08,0.10059064250867845,0.1325137921121439,0.10272763988628984

Methods: This is a basic, sectional and descriptive study. Stationary population of this study was patients who were admitted to cardiology inpatient and outpatient clinics of Tepecik Educational and Research Hospital between 01.06.2013 and 31.07.2013. A socio-demographic questionnaire and the Turkish version of Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAS) were given to patients by interviewer. Results: In the study, there were 101 participants aged between 18-65.61 participants (60.4%) were admitted to outpatient clinic and 40 participants (39.6%) were admitted to inpatient clinic. 79.2% of participants in the study had ischemic heart disease. The mean of HAS scores of the participants was 10.28 +/- 6.21 (min:0, max:26). 27 participants (26.7%) had no anxiety. 49 (485%) participants had mild anxiety and 25 (24.8%) participants had severe anxiety. As for gender, the anxiety average score of the male patients was statistically lower than those of the female patients (p<0.05). When it comes to family history of the psychiatric disease, the anxiety levels of the patients showed a statistical significance (p<0.05). As to drug use, the difference was statistically significant between the groups (p<0.05). The anxiety average score of the patients who have a healthy nutritional status was statistically lower (p<0.05). Conclusion: For the patients diagnosed with anxiety, doctors must be aware of the risk factors like gender, family history of psychiatric disease, drug use and nutritional status.","[Alavci, Ozgur; Balci, Umut Gok] Izmir Tepecik Res & Training Hosp, Dept Family Med, Izmir, Turkey; [Korkmaz, Hasret] Bayram Dist Govt Hosp, Family Med Polyclin, Canakkale, Turkey; [Kilicaslan, Baris] Izmir Tepecik Res & Training Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Izmir, Turkey; [Ongel, Kurtulus] Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Dept Family Med, Izmir, Turkey","Ongel, K (corresponding author), Katip Celebi Univ, Family Med, Izmir, Turkey.",,,,,,"Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2007, NAT SURV MENT HLTH ; Carney RM, 1999, PSYCHOSOM MED, V61, P666, DOI 10.1097/00006842-199909000-0000; Ekman I, 2000, SCAND J CARING SCI, V14, P130, DOI 10.1080/0283931005016236; Franklin JE, 1996, TXB CONSULTATION LIA, P42; Jespersen L, 2013, CLIN RES CARDIOL, V102, P571, DOI 10.1007/s00392-013-0568-; KENDLER KS, 1992, ARCH GEN PSYCHIAT, V49, P27; Kuper Hannah, 2002, Semin Vasc Med, V2, P267, DOI 10.1055/s-2002-3540; LEWINSOHN PM, 1993, J ABNORM PSYCHOL, V102, P133, DOI 10.1037/0021-843X.102.1.13; Licht CMM, 2008, ARCH GEN PSYCHIAT, V65, P1358, DOI 10.1001/archpsyc.65.12.135; Mergen H, 2012, SMYRNA TIP DERGISI, V2, P2; Murray CJL, 1997, LANCET, V349, P1498, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(96)07492-; Nguyen Sun B, 2009, Congest Heart Fail, V15, P31, DOI 10.1111/j.1751-7133.2008.00046.; Nordgren L, 2007, QUAL HEALTH RES, V17, P4, DOI 10.1177/104973230629638; Ozmen E, 2005, ANADOLU PSIKIYATRI D, V6, P8; REGIER DA, 1990, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V264, P251; Somberg TC, 2008, CARDIOLOGY, V111, P75, DOI 10.1159/00011969; Vidovich MI, 2009, CARDIOVASC PSYCHIAT, V200; Vural Mutlu, 2006, Anadolu Kardiyol Derg, V6, P5; Wang GF, 2013, PSYCHOSOM MED, V75, P530, DOI 10.1097/PSY.0b013e318298431; YANOVSKI SZ, 1993, AM J PSYCHIAT, V150, P147; Yonkers KA, 1998, AM J PSYCHIAT, V155, P596, DOI 10.1176/ajp.155.5.59; Zambroski Cheryl Hoyt, 2005, Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs, V4, P198, DOI 10.1016/j.ejcnurse.2005.03.01",22,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,213.0,216,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700033,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0022727272727272726,1.1693072805911943e-11,0.004334360236312917,0.10198598746246641,0.004334360236312917

These adrenal masses are usually non-functioning and the patients have no symptoms so the diagnosis is incidental. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review for all articles published until April 2015. The initial search identified 98 publications. We considered some characteristics: the mean age of the patients at diagnosis was 59 years (range 19 - 84); there were approximately 1.7 times more female patients than male patients; mean diameter of the lesions was 10.3 cm (range 2 - 25). Surgical treatment was more often open with midline or subcostal Results: From literature analysis we know that small adrenal hemangiomas are usually asymptomatic. Only four patients in our literature review show endocrinologic disturbances with three cases of subclinical Cushing's syndrome and a case of hyperaldosteronism. The pre-operative radiologic features play a fundamental role for correct surgical approach. On enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) scan adrenal hemangiomas tend to be heterogeneous, hypodense lesions with high-density rim of tissue at the periphery. On Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) common findings associated with adrenal hemangiomas are hypointense inhomogeneous masses with central hyperintensity on T1 images and a high intensity peripheral rim on T2 images due to hemorrhage or necrosis. Conclusion: Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is considered the standard treatment in case of benign lesions. Some authors suggest that the main limitation during laparoscopic dissection for large and potentially malign adrenal tumors is incomplete resection and capsular disruption with increased risk of local recurrence and intra-abdominal neoplastic dissemination. We recommend for these patients an integrated multidisciplinary approach that considers endocrine studies, preoperative radiologic findings and the experience of surgical team.","[Antonino, Agrusa; Giorgio, Romano; Giuseppe, Amato; Giuseppe, Di Buono; Vincenzo, Sorce; Leonardo, Gulotta; Gaspare, Gulotta] Univ Palermo, Dept Gen Surg Urgency & Organ Transplantat, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Juliana, Dominguez Ligia; Laura, Vernuccio; Pasquale, Mansueto] Univ Palermo, Geriatr Unit, Dept Clin Med & Emerging Dis, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Roberto, Citarrella] Univ Palermo, Dept Expt Biomed & Clin Neurosci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Massimo, Galia] Univ Palermo, Sect Radiol DiBiMeF, I-90133 Palermo, Italy","Antonino, A (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Gen Surg Urgency & Organ Transplantat, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",,"Di Buono, Giuseppe/AAJ-6311-2020","Amato, Giuseppe/0000-0002-1352-9291; Sorce, Vincenzo/0000-0002-4948-9383",,,"AFTALION B, 1988, J REPROD MED, V33, P32; Agrusa A, 2015, INT J SURG CASE REP, V16, P150, DOI 10.1016/j.ijscr.2015.09.04; Agrusa A, 2014, INT J SURG, V12, pS72, DOI 10.1016/j.ijsu.2014.05.05; Agrusa A, 2012, G CHIR, V33, P40; Agrusa A, 2015, SURG ENDOS; Agrusa A, 2016, INT J SURG, V28, pS114, DOI 10.1016/j.ijsu.2015.12.05; Agrusa A, 2014, INT J SURG, V12, pS37, DOI 10.1016/j.ijsu.2014.08.38; Agrusa A, 2014, WORLD J EMERG SURG, V9, DOI 10.1186/1749-7922-9-3; Agrusa A, 2014, INT J SURG CASE REP, V5, P70, DOI 10.1016/j.ijscr.2013.12.02; [Anonymous], 2002, NIH CONSENS STATE SC, V19, P; Benassai G, 2014, INT J SURG, V12, pS22, DOI 10.1016/j.ijsu.2014.05.03; Bozkurt O, 2015, UROLOGY, V85, pE15, DOI 10.1016/j.urology.2014.12.01; Conzo G, 2013, INT J SURG, V11, P152, DOI 10.1016/j.ijsu.2012.12.00; Conzo G, 2012, ANN ITAL CHIR, V83, P43; Edwards JP, 2014, INT J SURG CASE REP, V5, P52, DOI 10.1016/j.ijscr.2013.11.00; Fernandez Ruiz M, 1995, ARCH ESP UROL, V48, P8; Forbes TL, 2005, CAN J SURG, V48, P7; Rebollo CG, 2013, ARCH ESP UROL, V66, P31; HAMRICKTURNER JE, 1994, MAGN RESON IMAGING, V12, P1263, DOI 10.1016/0730-725X(94)90091-; Hazzan D, 2001, SURG ENDOSC-ULTRAS, V15, P1356, DOI 10.1007/s00464008005; JOHNSON C C, 1955, J Urol, V74, P57; Kieger AJ, 2011, J UROLOGY, V186, P2415, DOI 10.1016/j.juro.2011.09.06; Lombardi CP, 2012, SURGERY, V152, P1158, DOI 10.1016/j.surg.2012.08.01; Lorenzon L, 2013, ANN ITAL CHIR, V84, P69; NAKAGAWA N, 1986, CLIN RADIOL, V37, P97, DOI 10.1016/S0009-9260(86)80185-; Ng Alvin Choong Meng, 2008, Endocr Pract, V14, P10; Noh JJ, 2014, J PANCREAS, V15, P254, DOI 10.6092/1590-8577/240; Novo G, 2011, INT ANGIOL, V30, P24; Oishi M, 2012, SURG TODAY, V42, P973, DOI 10.1007/s00595-012-0203-; Paluszkiewicz P, 2010, ARCH MED SCI, V6, P122, DOI 10.5114/aoms.2010.1351; Pisano G, 2013, ANN ITAL CHIR, V8; Quildrian SD, 2013, INT J SURG CASE REP, V4, P219, DOI 10.1016/j.ijscr.2012.11.02; Romano G, 2013, G CHIR, V34, P180, DOI 10.11138/gchir/2013.34.5.18; Romano G., 2014, MINERVA CHIR, V69, P12; Romano G, 2006, G CHIR, V27, P22; Stumvoll M, 1996, J UROLOGY, V155, P638, DOI 10.1016/S0022-5347(01)66473-; Telem DA, 2009, JSLS-J SOC LAPAROEND, V13, P26; Terzolo M, 2011, EUR J ENDOCRINOL, V164, P851, DOI 10.1530/EJE-10-114; Todorov G, 2007, Khirurgiia (Sofiia), P5; Yagisawa T, 2001, INT J UROL, V8, P457, DOI 10.1046/j.1442-2042.2001.00352.",40,18,18,0,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,385.0,389,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000018,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0040289256198347105,3.201841901629723e-05,0.007836233167315455,0.09086215797625194,0.007836233167315455

The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of 8 weeks of sport rock climbing (SRC) training on anxiety in healthy sedentary adults. A total number of nineteen students participated in this study voluntarily composing of a control group (CG, n=10, age 21.90 +/- 1.66 years, height 168.50 +/- 4.40 cm, weight 61.18 +/- 7.08 kg) and an experimental group (EG, n=9, age 21.11 +/- 2.31 years, height 167.33 +/- 6.44 cm, weight 59.31 +/- 8.39 kg). After the EG had been taught basic climbing and rope techniques, body composition and aerobic power measurements were taken for both groups. The EG engaged in climbing training by using a top-rope method for 60 minutes a day with an intensity level of 70 % of HR reserve, three days a week for eight weeks. The CG did not engage in any systematic physical activity program during the study. The Competitive Sport Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2) was given to participants twice. The EG completed the Inventory 20 minutes before the first and the last climbing trial. The CG completed the Inventories on first and last day of 8 weeks period. The results indicated significant changes in all CSAI-2 results for EG, including cognitive (p_=_0.002) and somatic anxiety (p_=_0.032) reduced, self-confidence (p_=_0.001) increased. This current study is one of the first research efforts examining the psychological effects of eight weeks SRC training. Results demonstrated that eight weeks of SRC training significantly reduces cognitive and somatic anxiety and increases self-confidence. In addition to the psychological effects, eight weeks of SRC training also improved the VO2max of participants. This study suggests that SRC can be useful as a regular physical activity in controlling and improving anxiety in the study sample.","[Aras, Dicle] Ankara Univ, Fac Sport Sci, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Ewert, Alan W.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Bloomington, IN USA","Aras, D (corresponding author), Ankara Univ, Fac Sport Sci, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",,"Aras, Dicle/A-7301-2018","Aras, Dicle/0000-0002-9443-9860",,,"Aidar FJ, 2012, STROKE RES TREAT, V2012, P; Fernandez EMA, 2007, PSICOTHEMA, V19, P15; [Anonymous], 1989, OUTDOOR ADVENTURE P; Aras D, 2014, J SPORT MED PHYS FIT, V54, P; Arazi H, 2012, ACTA KINESIOL, V6, P; Asmundson GJG, 2013, DEPRESS ANXIETY, V30, P362, DOI 10.1002/da.2204; Camacho TC, 1996, AM J EPIDEMIOL, V13, P22; Carraro A, 2012, RES DEV DISABIL, V33, P1221, DOI 10.1016/j.ridd.2012.02.01; de Lima C, 2012, INT J SPORTS MED, V33, P723, DOI 10.1055/s-0032-130632; Dickson T, 2012, SPORTS TECHNOL, V5, P; Draper N, 2012, INT J SPORTS MED, V33, P13, DOI 10.1055/s-0031-128434; Draper N, 2008, J SPORT SCI MED, V7, P49; Draper N, 2010, EUR J SPORT SCI, V10, P13, DOI 10.1080/1746139090310812; DuPont RL, 1996, ANXIETY, V2, P167, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1522-7154(1996)2:4<167::AID-ANXI2>3.0.CO;2-; Ehrman JK, 2010, ACSMS RESOURCE MANU; Feskanich D, 2002, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V288, P2300, DOI 10.1001/jama.288.18.230; Fourie M, 2013, W INDIAN MED J, V62, P524, DOI 10.7727/wimj.2012.10; Freitas P.

It has been claimed that oxidative stress and factors such as metal accumulation in the brain play important roles in the etiopathogenesis of the disease. Material and methods: The subjects of this study consisted of 24 individuals with Alzheimer's disease and 15 healthy agematched controls. Blood samples were withdrawn from the patients and healthy controls, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes SOD (Superoxide Dismutase), GSH (Glutathion), GSHPx (Glutathion peroxidase), GST (Glutathion S-Transferase) and MDA (Malondialdehyde) levels were determined by Spectrometer. Some metals and heavy metals were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Results: Biochemical analyses showed a significant decrease of the main enzymatic antioxidant defences (SOD, GSH, GST and GSHPx) and increased production of lipid peroxidation marker (MDA) in the serum of AD patients, compared to age-matched control group (p< 0.001). Also the levels of Zn, Mg, and Mn was lower and Fe, Pb, and Cd was higher in the patient group, compared to the control group. Serum Cu and Co levels did not differ significantly between the patient and control groups (p> 0.001). Conclusion: These results supports the theory that in AD there is a defect in the antioxidant defense system, which may lead to oxidative damage. Also alterations in some trace metals and their related enzymes may play a role of etiopathogenesis in AD.","[Arslan, Ayse; Demir, Halit] Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Dept Biochem, Fac Sci, Van, Turkey; [Tuzun, Fatma Aykan] Private Kocaeli Hosp Ctr, Dept Neurol, Kocaeli, Turkey; [Tamer, Sibel] Private Sincan Koru Hosp, Dept Neurol, Ankara, Turkey; [Aycan, Abdurrahman] Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Dursun Odabasi Res Hosp, Deparment Brain Surg, Van, Turkey; [Demir, Canan] Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Vocat Sch Hlth Serv, Van, Turkey; [Tasin, Muhterem] Dicle Univ, Dept Neurol, Diyarbakir, Turkey; [Gonullu, Edip] Training & Res Hosp, Dept Anesthesia, Van, Turkey","Arslan, A (corresponding author), Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Dept Biochem, Fac Sci, Tusba, Van, Turkey.",,"Gönüllü, Edip/AAV-7377-2021","Gönüllü, Edip/0000-0002-7751-3758",,,"Akiyama H, 2000, NEUROBIOL AGING, V21, P383, DOI 10.1016/S0197-4580(00)00124-; AMBROSIO G, 1991, J CLIN INVEST, V87, P2056, DOI 10.1172/JCI11523; Ansari MA, 2010, J NEUROPATH EXP NEUR, V69, P155, DOI 10.1097/NEN.0b013e3181cb5af; Bandyopadhyay U, 1999, CURR SCI INDIA, V77, P65; Barbagallo M, 2011, MAGNESIUM RES, V24, pS115, DOI 10.1684/mrh.2011.028; BASUN H, 1991, J NEURAL TRANSM-PARK, V3, P23; Beckman KB, 1998, PHYSIOL REV, V78, P547, DOI 10.1152/physrev.1998.78.2.54; Bocca Beatrice, 2005, Ann Ist Super Sanita, V41, P19; Bourdel-Marchasson I, 2001, AGE AGEING, V30, P235, DOI 10.1093/ageing/30.3.23; BOWLING AC, 1995, LIFE SCI, V56, P1151, DOI 10.1016/0024-3205(95)00055-; Bush AI, 2003, ALZ DIS ASSOC DIS, V17, P147, DOI 10.1097/00002093-200307000-0000; Bush AI, 2003, TRENDS NEUROSCI, V26, P207, DOI 10.1016/S0166-2236(03)00067-; Casado A, 2008, NEUROCHEM RES, V33, P450, DOI 10.1007/s11064-007-9453-; Cherubini A, 2005, FREE RADICAL BIO MED, V39, P841, DOI 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2005.06.02; DRAPER HH, 1988, CELLULAR ANTIOXIDANT, P9; Ferri CP, 2005, LANCET, V366, P2112, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67889-; Frausto da Silva JJR., 2001, BIOL CHEM ELEMENT; Gerhardsson L, 2008, DEMENT GERIATR COGN, V25, P508, DOI 10.1159/00012936; Gonzalez-Dominguez R, 2014, BIOMETALS, V27, P539, DOI 10.1007/s10534-014-9728-; HABIG WH, 1974, J BIOL CHEM, V249, P713; Jentzsch AM, 1996, FREE RADICAL BIO MED, V20, P251, DOI 10.1016/0891-5849(95)02043-; Kelley BJ, 2007, NEUROL CLIN, V25, P577, DOI 10.1016/j.ncl.2007.03.00; Khalil N, 2009, NEUROPSYCHOLOGY, V23, P10, DOI 10.1037/a001375; Lovell MA, 1998, J NEUROL SCI, V158, P47, DOI 10.1016/S0022-510X(98)00092-; Lovell MA, 1999, BRAIN RES, V823, P88, DOI 10.1016/S0006-8993(99)01114-; Mangialasche F, 2009, AGEING RES REV, V8, P30; Marnett LJ, 2000, CARCINOGENESIS, V21, P361, DOI 10.1093/carcin/21.3.36; MCCORD JM, 1969, J BIOL CHEM, V244, P604; MCKHANN G, 1984, NEUROLOGY, V34, P939, DOI 10.1212/WNL.34.7.93; MICHIELS C, 1994, FREE RADICAL BIO MED, V17, P235, DOI 10.1016/0891-5849(94)90079-; Nunomura A, 2006, J NEUROPATH EXP NEUR, V65, P631, DOI 10.1097/01.jnen.0000228136.58062.b; Cristalli DO, 2012, J NEUROL SCI, V314, P48, DOI 10.1016/j.jns.2011.11.00; Padurariu M, 2010, NEUROSCI LETT, V469, P6, DOI 10.1016/j.neulet.2009.11.03; PAGLIA DE, 1967, J LAB CLIN MED, V70, P15; Patra RC, 1999, VET HUM TOXICOL, V41, P6; Perry G, 2002, DRUG DEVELOP RES, V56, P293, DOI 10.1002/ddr.1009; Pocernich CB, 2012, BBA-MOL BASIS DIS, V1822, P625, DOI 10.1016/j.bbadis.2011.10.00; Polidori MC, 2001, FREE RADICAL BIO MED, V30, P456, DOI 10.1016/S0891-5849(00)00345-; REITER RJ, 1995, FASEB J, V9, P526, DOI 10.1096/fasebj.9.7.773746; Rinaldi P, 2003, NEUROBIOL AGING, V24, P915, DOI 10.1016/S0197-4580(03)00031-; Rivera-Mancia S, 2011, BIOMETALS, V24, P811, DOI 10.1007/s10534-011-9454-; Saharan S, 2014, J ALZHEIMERS DIS, V40, P519, DOI 10.3233/JAD-13248; Schulz JB, 2000, EUR J BIOCHEM, V267, P4904, DOI 10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01595.; Selkoe DJ, 2001, J ALZHEIMERS DIS, V3, P75, DOI 10.3233/JAD-2001-311; Serra JA, 2001, J NEURAL TRANSM, V108, P1135, DOI 10.1007/s00702017000; Sharma R, 2004, ANTIOXID REDOX SIGN, V6, P289, DOI 10.1089/15230860432289935; SLATER TF, 1984, METHOD ENZYMOL, V105, P28; Sultana R, 2004, NEUROCHEM RES, V29, P2215, DOI 10.1007/s11064-004-7028-; Sultana R, 2008, NEUROCHEM RES, V33, P2540, DOI 10.1007/s11064-008-9593-; TIETZE F, 1969, ANAL BIOCHEM, V27, P502, DOI 10.1016/0003-2697(69)90064-; Torres LL, 2011, J ALZHEIMERS DIS, V26, P59, DOI 10.3233/JAD-2011-11028; Wang GC, 2000, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V28, P2135, DOI 10.1093/nar/28.10.213; Zhu XW, 2004, BRAIN RES, V1000, P32, DOI 10.1016/j.brainres.2004.01.01",53,4,4,0,14,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_144,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000015,,,,,2022-07-14,0.005475206611570247,9.618258407970553e-18,0.028634327192123357,0.07388128620602805,0.028634327192123357

Methods: The study was performed with a methodological design. Context, structural, criterion validity and internal consistency reliability and test-retest validity-reliability analysis were performed. The statistical meaningfulness level in all tests was determined as p<0.05. Results: As a result of context validity, factor analysis and item analysis, a 25 item scale with 3 sub components was obtained. In the scale, the variance amount explained by the three sub components was on a very good level (88.64%). The fact that all of the Cronbach alpha, Spearman-Brown and Guttman internal consistency coefficients of the scale and all of its sub components are above 0.70. When the test retest reliability coefficients of the whole scale and its sub components were examined, the scale was found to present consistent results in different applications and the scale was found to be reliable with regard to the constancy coefficient. The ACIS shows highly meaningful correlation with a scale of proven validity and reliability. Conclusion: The Adaptation to Chronic Illness Scale (ACIS), which was just added to literature, is a valid and reliable tool that can be used to evaluate adaptation to illness in individuals with chronic diseases.","[Atik, Derya; Karatepe, Hilal] Osmaniye Korkut Ata Univ, Sch Hlth, Nursing Div, Osmaniye, Turkey","Atik, D (corresponding author), Osmaniye Korkut Ata Univ, Sch Hlth, Nursing Div, Osmaniye, Turkey.",,,,,,"Adaylar Aygun M, 1995, THESIS ISTANBUL ; Akdemir N, 2011, INTERNAL MED NURSIN; Akgul A, 2005, SPSS STAT ANAL TECH; Aksayan S, 2004, RES NURSING POLICY ; Beck CM, 1994, MENTAL HLTH PSYCHIA; Bennett SJ, 1997, HEART LUNG, V26, P273, DOI 10.1016/S0147-9563(97)90084-; Birol L, 2002, NURSING PROCES; Buyukozturk S, 2008, DATA ANAL HD; Demirag SA, 2009, J HLTH LIFESTYLE, V2, P5; DEROGATIS LR, 1986, J PSYCHOSOM RES, V30, P77, DOI 10.1016/0022-3999(86)90069-; Ercan I, 2004, ULUDAG U TIP FAKULTE, V30, P21; Erdogan A, 2008, ANADOLU PSIKIYATR DE, V9, P24; Eti Asian F, 2010, INTERNAL SURG ILLNE; HURNY C, 1993, SUPPORT CARE CANCER, V1, P200, DOI 10.1007/BF0036644; Kacmaz N, 2003, THESIS ISTANBUL ; Mete HE., 2008, CLIN PSYCHIATR, V11, P; MORISKY DE, 1986, MED CARE, V24, P67, DOI 10.1097/00005650-198601000-0000; Polit D, 2020, ESSENTIALS NURSING ; Roojien AJ, 2004, Q J MED, V97, P34; Sanden-Eriksson B, 2000, J ADV NURS, V31, P1393, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2648.2000.01410.; Secer I, 2013, PRACTICAL DATA ANA; Taysancil E, 2006, MEASUREMENT ANAL DA; VATANSEVER O, 2014, TURK SOC CARDIOL TUR, V5, P66, DOI DOI 10.5543/KHD.2014.00; Veneziano L, 1997, AM J HEALTH BEHAV, V21, P6; Williams B, 2009, PATIENT EDUC COUNS, V77, P14, DOI 10.1016/j.pec.2009.03.00; Yaman S, 2012, ASSESSMENT EVALUATI; YESILBALKAN OU, 2005, J EGE U NURSING SCH, V21, P1; Yurdugul H., 2005, MEASUREMENT THEORY ",28,7,7,0,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,135.0,142,,,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700021,,,,,2022-07-14,0.002892561983471074,3.9954086455191054e-15,0.008348450125047069,0.07083220523777815,0.008348450125047069

This study was aimed to determine the effect of pressured varicose vein stockings on sleep quality, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome symptoms, and symptoms of patients with varicose veins who were suggested for conservative treatment. Materials and methods: The study was designed according to a pretest posttest single study group pattern from experimental research methods. In gathering data for the study, a questionnaire on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, The Berlin Sleep Questionnaire, and the Sleep Quality Scale were used. Results: One month of varicose vein stocking use was seen to decrease Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) risk (p<0.05). When the sleep quality of patients for the last month was evaluated using the The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Scale (PSQS), a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of the first inventory application and the last inventory application was found (p<0.01), and statistically meaningful decreases in pain, cramps, edema, itching, weight feeling and leg fatigue perceptions were seen in patients (p<0.05). Conclusion: Regular varicose vein stocking use was found to increase sleep quality and improve OSAS symptoms. In addition, regular varicose vein stocking use was found to decrease symptoms of patients with varicose veins.","[Atik, Derya; Karatepe, Hilal] Osmaniye Korkut Ata Univ, Sch Hlth, Nursing Div, Osmaniye, Turkey; [Erdogan, Zeynep] Bulent Ecevit Univ, Vocat Sch Hlth Serv, Zonguldak, Turkey; [Atik, Cem] Private New Life Hosp, Osmaniye, Turkey; [Cinar, Sezgi] Celal Bayar Univ, Sch Hlth, Nursing Div, Manisa, Turkey","Atik, D (corresponding author), Osmaniye Korkut Ata Univ, Sch Hlth, Nursing Div, Osmaniye, Turkey.",,"erdoğan, zeynep/AAB-7372-2022; ERDOGAN, ZEYNEP/T-8947-2018","erdoğan, zeynep/0000-0002-7298-7559; ERDOGAN, ZEYNEP/0000-0002-7298-7559",,,"Abrishami A, 2010, CAN J ANAESTH, V57, P423, DOI 10.1007/s12630-010-9280-; Agargun MY., 1996, TURK PSIKIYATR DERG, V7, P10; Beebe-Dimmer JL, 2005, ANN EPIDEMIOL, V15, P175, DOI 10.1016/j.annepidem.2004.05.01; Bozkurt K., 2007, KRON VEN YET IU CERR, V56, P8; BUYSSE DJ, 1989, PSYCHIAT RES, V28, P193, DOI 10.1016/0165-1781(89)90047-; Ceviker K, 2015, QUAL LIFE RE; Col C., 2000, NURS FORUM, V3, P3; Duman E.

Age, gender, geographical characteristics and genetic affect the distribution of the disease. Despite the treatment, a part of the disease may progress to end-stage renal disease. We evaluated the PGD patients and retrospectively regarding to their clinical and histopathological characteristics. Materials and methods: In this study PGD patients, who have had renal biopsy between 1st January 2009 and 31st December 2014 were evaluated. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, response of the treatment, biopsy evidences, and the risk factors associated with mortality were analyzed. We also compared the cases of primary glomerulonephritis retrospectively. The mean value of the follow-up periods was 22 months (range: 8 - 76 months). Results: The median age was 42 years (18 - 80) in 264 patients. When five groups were compared, there was statistically important difference between the groups (p < 0.001). The distributions of PGD subgroups were 40.5% for membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN), 20.4% for IgA nephropathy (IgAN), 25.7% for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), 7.9% for minimal change disease (MCD) and 5.3% for membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). The distrubition of gender was not significantly in the five PGD groups (p=0.269). Nephrotic syndrome was the most biopsy indication in MGN patients (76.6%). Nephritic syndrome was more seen in immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) patients (63%). Chronic kidney disease was more detected in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) patients as biopsy indication (p<0.001). Minimal change disease (MCD) and IgAN patients were more received with steroid treatment (85.7% and 55.5% respectively). Cyclophosphamide was more received in MGN patients. Serum IgG levels were more higher in FSGS and IgAN patients (p<0.001). Partial remission was more seen in MCD patients. Complete remission was more detected in MGN and FSGS patients. 29.1% of IgAN patients were not received treatment response. Six year renal survival rates were 84.1% (MGN), 87.1% (IgAN), 95.3% (MCD), 64.3% (MPGN) and 76.5% (FSGS) respectively. Conclusion: Biopsy maintains its diagnostic importance in glomerular diseases. Renal functions at diagnosis are important in response to treatment. Early diagnosis, follow-up and appropriate immunosuppressive medications affect mortality and clinical progress in PGD.","[Ayar, Yavuz; Ersoy, Alparslan; Gullulu, Mustafa; Oruc, Aysegul; Yildiz, Abdulmecit] Uludag Univ, Fac Med, Dept Nephrol, Internal Med, Bursa, Turkey; [Can, Fatma Ezgi] Uludag Univ, Fac Med, Dept Biostat, Bursa, Turkey; [Bayrakci, Ismail; Demirayak, Dilay; Duger, Hakan; Ocak, Tugba; Korkut, Bayram; Sahin, Ahmet Bilgehan; Camci, Nihal Yucel] Uludag Univ, Fac Med, Internal Med, Bursa, Turkey; [Vuruskan, Berna Aytac] Uludag Univ, Dept Pathol, Bursa, Turkey","Ayar, Y (corresponding author), Uludag Univ, Fac Med, Dept Nephrol, TR-16059 Gorukle, Turkey.",,"Oruc, Aysegul/AAH-4002-2021; Vuruskan, Berna Aytac/AAH-9746-2021; Ersoy, Alparslan/AAH-5054-2021; Şahin, Ahmet Bilgehan/AAM-4927-2020; Ayar, Yavuz/O-9948-2015","Ersoy, Alparslan/0000-0002-0710-0923; Şahin, Ahmet Bilgehan/0000-0002-7846-0870; ",,,"Briganti EM, 2001, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V16, P1364, DOI 10.1093/ndt/16.7.136; Chou YH, 2012, CLIN J AM SOC NEPHRO, V7, P1401, DOI 10.2215/CJN.0450051; Choy BY, 2006, AM J TRANSPLANT, V6, P2535, DOI 10.1111/j.1600-6143.2006.01502.; Eckardt KU, 2012, KIDNEY INT SUPPL, V2, P7, DOI 10.1038/kisup.2012.; Franklin KA, 2014, OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP AP, P; Malafronte P, 2006, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V21, P3098, DOI 10.1093/ndt/gfl23; McGrogan A, 2011, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V26, P414, DOI 10.1093/ndt/gfq66; Mitwalli A H, 2000, Saudi J Kidney Dis Transpl, V11, P56; Moranne O, 2008, QJM-INT J MED, V101, P215, DOI 10.1093/qjmed/hcm14; Rivera F, 2002, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V17, P1594, DOI 10.1093/ndt/17.9.159; Shiiki H, 2004, KIDNEY INT, V65, P1400, DOI 10.1111/j.1523-1755.2004.00518.; Simon P, 2004, KIDNEY INT, V66, P905, DOI 10.1111/j.1523-1755.2004.00834.; Swarnalatha G, 2015, SAUDI J KIDNEY DIS T, V26, P173, DOI 10.4103/1319-2442.14877",13,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000027,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0013429752066115702,4.402262488531609e-27,0.0024779299821800454,0.056040247086543975,0.0024779299821800454

We aimed to investigate the success of LAM treatment in one year period. Materials and methods: We retrospectively recruited 125 naive CHB patients on LAM therapy. We recorded biopsy results, demographic, biochemical, serological and virological values at baseline and 3th, 6th and 12th months of treatment. Virological response was defined as undetectable hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA (<20 IU/mL). Results: Of patients, 81 were male (65%), and the mean age was 42 +/- 13. Mean histological activity index (HAI) was 4.55 +/- 2.16, and fibrosis was 2.65 +/- 0.90 in 114 patients who had biopsy results. The initial mean HBV DNA level was 5.52 x 106 IU/mL. Seroconversion was observed in only 3 (18.75%) of 16 HBeAg (+) patients. While baseline median ALT value was 36 U/L, following values were 28 U/L, 25 U/L and 24 U/L, respectively. HBV DNA significantly and gradually decreased with LAM treatment and it was finally determined to be negative in 80% of the patients in the 12th month. Conclusion: LAM treatment for naive CHB patients continues to be effective for the first 6th months, and if continued to be treated until 12th month, this efficiency can increase. However, it should be kept in mind that any patient with positive HBV DNA are under risk of HBV related complications.","[Balkan, Ayhan; Barutcu, Sezgin; Erdem, Ramazan; Konduk, Bugra Tolga; Yildirim, Abdullah Emre; Gulsen, Murat Taner] Gaziantep Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Univ Bulvari Sehitkamil, TR-27310 Gaziantep, Turkey","Balkan, A (corresponding author), Gaziantep Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Univ Bulvari Sehitkamil, TR-27310 Gaziantep, Turkey.",,"Barutçu, Sezgin/AAD-4552-2019; YILDIRIM, Abdullah Emre/AAG-6561-2020; Gülşen, Murat Taner/AAH-1097-2020","YILDIRIM, Abdullah Emre/0000-0002-4386-9297; Gülşen, Murat Taner/0000-0002-8531-9402",,,"Akuta N, 2003, J HEPATOL, V38, P91, DOI 10.1016/S0168-8278(02)00335-; Allen MI, 1998, HEPATOLOGY, V27, P1670, DOI 10.1002/hep.51027062; Avellon A, 2006, J MED VIROL, V78, P24, DOI 10.1002/jmv.2051; Balik I, 2010, UL VIR HEP K 2010 A; Clements CJ, 2010, B WORLD HEALTH ORGAN, V88, P66, DOI 10.2471/BLT.08.06572; EASL Jury, 2003, J Hepatol, V38, P53; Fournier Claire, 2007, Clin Liver Dis, V11, P869, DOI 10.1016/j.cld.2007.08.01; Hadziyannis SJ, 2000, HEPATOLOGY, V32, P847, DOI 10.1053/jhep.2000.1791; Hadziyannis SJ, 2006, GASTROENTEROLOGY, V131, P1743, DOI 10.1053/j.gastro.2006.09.02; ISHAK K, 1995, J HEPATOL, V22, P696, DOI 10.1016/0168-8278(95)80226-; Lai CL, 2007, NEW ENGL J MED, V357, P2576, DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa06642; Lai CL, 2003, LANCET, V362, P2089, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)15108-; Liaw YF, 2009, GASTROENTEROLOGY, V136, P486, DOI 10.1053/j.gastro.2008.10.02; Lok ASF, 2007, HEPATOLOGY, V45, P507, DOI 10.1002/hep.2151; Papatheodoridis G, 2012, J HEPATOL, V57, P167, DOI 10.1016/j.jhep.2012.02.01; Ryu SH, 2003, J HEPATOL, V39, P614, DOI 10.1016/S0168-8278(03)00394-; Sayan M, 2011, INT J INFECT DIS, V15, pE722, DOI 10.1016/j.ijid.2011.05.01; Suzuki F, 2002, J HEPATOL, V37, P824, DOI 10.1016/S0168-8278(02)00281-; Teo CG, 2010, ANTIVIR THER, V15, P445, DOI 10.3851/IMP155; Torresi J, 2002, J CLIN VIROL, V25, P97, DOI 10.1016/S1386-6532(02)00049-",20,0,0,1,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,663.0,667,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_72,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400001,,,,,2022-07-14,0.002066115702479339,1.478881608687625e-14,0.003910839248414035,0.08655763504511191,0.003889074839539288

Methods: The study included 77 voluntary patients admitted to the rheumatology clinic. The control group consisted of 80 healthy individuals. All participants were requested to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepines Scale (ESS), International Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) study group (IRLSSG) rating scale, and SF-36 quality of life questionnaire. The age of pSS onset, age at diagnosis, and age at the beginning of therapy were recorded. Patients with urinary incontinence were evaluated with the incontinence severity index(ISI). Results: The mean scores of the mental health, general health, vitality, physical function, physical role function and emotional role function parameters of the patients were statistically significantly lower than those of healthy volunteers. In the ESS scale, the average score was found to be 7.9 +/- 2.8 in the patient group and 4.5 +/- 2.1 in the control group. The average IRLSSG rating scale score was 13.4 +/- 7.6 in the patient group and 5.4 +/- 5.2 in the control group. The total PSQI score was 7.8 +/- 3.5 in the patient group and 4.11 +/- 1.64 in the control group. There was a statistically significant difference in terms of ESS, IRLSSG rating scale and sleep quality scores. Patients with urinary incontinence (n=26) had significantly higher PSQI and SF-36 scores than patients without urinary incontinence (n=51). Conclusion: Patients diagnosed with pSS have a significantly decreased sleep quality and HRQOL compared with the normal population. Urinary incontinence had a negative impact on sleep and HRQOL. RLS, sleepiness and urinary incontinence are common in patients with pSS.","[Balkarli, Ayse] Antalya Training & Res Hosp, Div Rheumatol, Dept Internal Med, Antalya, Turkey; [Semiz, Murat] Gulhane Mil Med Fac, Dept Psychiat, Ankara, Turkey; [Uslu, Ali Ugur] Eskisehir Mil Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Eskisehir, Turkey; [Yalcinkaya, Soner] Antalya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Urol, Antalya, Turkey; [Can, Beray] Pamukkale Univ, Dept Internal Med, Denizli, Turkey; [Sahin, Muhammed] Necmettin Erbakan Univ, Div Phys Med & Rehabil, Konya, Turkey; [Kucuk, Adem; Tunc, Recep] Necmettin Erbakan Univ, Div Rheumatol, Dept Internal Med, Konya, Turkey; [Solak, Yalcin] Necmettin Erbakan Univ, Div Nephrol, Dept Internal Med, Konya, Turkey","Balkarli, A (corresponding author), Antalya Training & Res Hosp, Div Rheumatol, Dept Internal Med, Antalya, Turkey.",,"Solak, Yalcin/AAD-1393-2020",,,,"Altaweel W, 2012, NEUROUROL URODYNAM, V31, P642, DOI 10.1002/nau.2220; Araujo AB, 2014, J UROLOGY, V191, P100, DOI 10.1016/j.juro.2013.07.01; Bayetto K, 2010, AUST DENT J, V55, P39, DOI 10.1111/j.1834-7819.2010.01197.; Belenguer R, 2005, CLIN EXP RHEUMATOL, V23, P35; Bowman SJ, 2000, ARTHRITIS RHEUM, V43, pS30; BUYSSE DJ, 1989, PSYCHIAT RES, V28, P193, DOI 10.1016/0165-1781(89)90047-; Chen YM, 2009, RHEUMATOLOGY, V48, P1261, DOI 10.1093/rheumatology/kep19; Epstein LC, 2014, CLIN RHEUMATOL, V33, P511, DOI 10.1007/s10067-013-2453-; Fox RI, 2005, LANCET, V366, P321, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66990-; Gandia Myriam, 2014, Oral Health Dent Manag, V13, P40; Godaert GLR, 2002, ANN NY ACAD SCI, V966, P320, DOI 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2002.tb04232.; Goodchild CE, 2010, MUSCULOSKELET CARE, V8, P107, DOI 10.1002/msc.17; GUDBJORNSSON B, 1993, BRIT J RHEUMATOL, V32, P107; Hening WA, 2001, NEUROLOGY, V56, pA; Iacopino Anthony M, 2010, J Can Dent Assoc, V76, pa9; Inal V, 2010, MOD RHEUMATOL, V20, P588, DOI 10.1007/s10165-010-0329-; Irwin DE, 2011, BJU INT, V108, P1132, DOI 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2010.09993.; JOHNS MW, 1991, SLEEP, V14, P540, DOI 10.1093/sleep/14.6.54; Kitapcioglu G, 2008, TURKIYE KLIN J IMMUN, V1, P; Mallah Fatemeh, 2014, J Family Reprod Health, V8, P1; McMillan AS, 2004, J ORAL REHABIL, V31, P653, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2842.2004.01384.; Moore Courtenay K, 2010, Curr Urol Rep, V11, P299, DOI 10.1007/s11934-010-0124-; Mulherin DM, 1997, BRIT J OBSTET GYNAEC, V104, P1019, DOI 10.1111/j.1471-0528.1997.tb12060.; Ng W-F, 2011, ANN RHEUM DIS, V70, P51; Priori R, 2010, CLIN EXP RHEUMATOL, V28, pS8; Rostron Jocelyne, 2002, Gerodontology, V19, P53, DOI 10.1111/j.1741-2358.2002.00053.; Sahin S, 2013, EUR REV MED PHARMACO, V17, P95; Sandvik H, 2006, INT UROGYNECOL J, V17, P520, DOI 10.1007/s00192-005-0060-; Simsek I, 2012, TURKIYE KLIN J IMMUN, V5, P1; Sinclair AJ, 2011, OBSTET GYNAECOL, V13, P143, DOI 10.1576/toag.13.3.143.2766; Sumardi R, 2014, ACTA MED INDONES, V46, P17; Thanou-Stavraki A, 2008, SEMIN ARTHRITIS RHEU, V37, P273, DOI 10.1016/j.semarthrit.2007.06.00; Theander L, 2010, RHEUMATOLOGY, V49, P1177, DOI 10.1093/rheumatology/keq02; Thomas E, 1998, BRIT J RHEUMATOL, V37, P106; Trotti LM, 2012, BRAIN BEHAV IMMUN, V26, P1239, DOI 10.1016/j.bbi.2012.06.00; Tufik SB, 2013, SLEEP MED, V14, P222, DOI 10.1016/j.sleep.2012.09.00; TURNERSTOKES L, 1992, J ROY SOC MED, V85, P38; Usmani ZA, 2012, SLEEP MED, V13, P1066, DOI 10.1016/j.sleep.2012.06.01; Vitali C, 2002, ANN RHEUM DIS, V61, P554, DOI 10.1136/ard.61.6.55; Walker J, 2003, J RHEUMATOL, V30, P240; Wang F, 2004, ARTHRITIS RHEUM-US, V50, P3637, DOI 10.1002/art.2062; WARE JE, 1992, MED CARE, V30, P473, DOI 10.1097/00005650-199206000-0000; Weinstock LB, 2012, SLEEP MED REV, V16, P341, DOI 10.1016/j.smrv.2011.09.00",43,2,2,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,4.0,,,,,917.0,923,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_110,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DY1XF,WOS:000384887000010,,,,,2022-07-14,0.004442148760330579,2.18992878313688e-08,0.02933403146156692,0.09901091370298772,0.029393822415246997

The aim of this study was to identify Anopheles fluviatilis complex species using proliferation and sequence analysis of ITS2 and also 28. S-D3parts of rDNA gene in southwestern Iran. Method: In this research Anopheles fluviatilis was caught from different areas of Kohgiluye and Boyer-Ahmad province at southwestern Iran at 1392. DNA was taken from 4 Anopheles fluviatilis selected samples and PCR tests of 28S-D3 part was done on sample's DNA and then after sequence of obtained results were identified and were compared with similar samples of Anopheles fluviatilis based on data's of gene word bank. Phylogenetic tree and individual sequences of samples were calculated. Results: PCR Phylogenetic analysis of r DNA 28S-D3 part of Anopheles fluviatilis confirmed that U genotype in Kohgiluye and Boyer-Ahmad province was identified. Gene length of r DNA 28S-D3 part between populations of this species was same (333bp).

The purpose of this study was to increase OVD in sports subjects so as to specifically investigate the influence on cervical spine mobility. In particular, we measured cervical range of motion (ROM) before and after increasing OVD in individuals, either with or without malocclusion, analyzing both sports and sedentary subjects. Materials and methods: Participants were divided into two groups: a sports group (SG) and a control group (CG), each including 18 subjects. The SG was composed of sports subjects (age: 20.11 +/- 3.45 yrs; BMI: 25.39 +/- 2.32 kg/m(2)), whereas the CG consisted of age-matched sedentary subjects (age: 25.78 +/- 2.26 yrs; BMI: 24.88 +/- 2.87 kg/m(2)). Cervical range of motion (ROM) was evaluated, by way of an accelerometer (Moover r, Sensor Medica r), before (pre-test) and after (post-test) increasing OVD. Results: The main finding of this study was that sports subjects showed no significant difference, compared to control subjects, in cervical ROM in response to increased OVD. Moreover, we found that sports and sedentary subjects alike showed no significant change in cervical spine mobility as a result of increased OVD, regardless of whether they were affected by malocclusion (class II) or represented subjects with normocclusion (class I). Conclusion: In accord with several studies reported in the literature, the findings of our study indicate that occlusal splints failed to significantly improve the physical-performance endpoint measured, i. e. cervical ROM, in sports subjects as compared to sedentary individuals. Due to the paucity of studies, characterized by conflicting results, there is as yet no compelling scientific evidence as to whether OVD positively impacts sports performance or not. Accordingly, we suggest that further scientific investigation, regarding the relationship between sports performance and OVD, be conducted in the field of sport and exercise sciences.","[Battaglia, Giuseppe; Iovane, Angelo; Bellafiore, Marianna; Patti, Antonino; Traina, Marcello; Palma, Antonio] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Battaglia, Giuseppe; Iovane, Angelo; Bellafiore, Marianna; Patti, Antonino; Traina, Marcello; Messina, Giuseppe; Palma, Antonio] Univ Palermo, Sport & Exercise Sci Res Unit, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Martines, Francesco] Univ Palermo, ENT Sect, BioNeC Dept, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Giustino, Valerio; Messina, Giuseppe] Posturalab Italy, Pavia, PV, Italy","Battaglia, G (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",,"Bellafiore, Marianna/AAN-5526-2021; Giustino, Valerio/AAR-6788-2021; Battaglia, Giuseppe/AAV-3916-2020; Messina, Giuseppe/N-7298-2019","Bellafiore, Marianna/0000-0002-3092-1666; Giustino, Valerio/0000-0002-4575-8021; Battaglia, Giuseppe/0000-0002-7758-7175; Messina, Giuseppe/0000-0003-2774-4950; Traina, Marcello/0000-0003-2373-3621; MARTINES, Francesco/0000-0002-8616-4481; Patti, Antonino/0000-0003-3753-5191",,,"Angle E.H., 1899, TAL COSM, V41, P24; Armijo-Olivo S, 2012, CLIN J PAIN, V28, P55, DOI 10.1097/AJP.0b013e31822019f; Badel Tomislav, 2007, Acta Medica Croatica, V61, P; Baldini A, 2011, MONDO ORTODONTICO, V36, P131, DOI DOI 10.1016/J.M0R.2010.09.00; Battaglia G, 2014, J SPORT MED PHYS FIT, V54, P58; Battaglia G, 2010, AGING CLIN EXP RES, V22, P406, DOI [10.3275/6713, 10.1007/BF03337736; Bellafiore M, 2011, AGING CLIN EXP RES, V23, P378, DOI [10.3275/7354, 10.1007/BF03337762; Bevilaqua-Grossi D, 2007, J APPL ORAL SCI, V15, P259, DOI 10.1590/S1678-7757200700040000; Bjorney A, 2007, PROG BRAIN RES, V166, P215, DOI 10.1016/S0079-6123(07)66019-; Chaves TC, 2014, BRAZ J PHYS THER, V18, P481, DOI 10.1590/bjpt-rbf.2014.006; Dawson EP, 1989, EVALUATION DIAGNOSIS, P5; DeWijer A, 1996, J ORAL REHABIL, V23, P742, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2842.1996.d01-187.; Fernandez-de-las-Penas C, 2009, J PAIN, V10, P1170, DOI 10.1016/j.jpain.2009.04.01; Fujimoto Mariko, 2001, Journal of Medical and Dental Sciences, V48, P13; GREENBERG MS, 1981, J AM DENT ASSOC, V103, P576, DOI 10.14219/jada.archive.1981.030; Hoerzer S, 2015, PLOS ONE, V10, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.013863; Hu JW, 2005, BRAIN RES, V1044, P93, DOI 10.1016/j.brainres.2005.03.00; Kim Hee-Sun, 2009, J Adv Prosthodont, V1, P118, DOI 10.4047/jap.2009.1.3.11; Knapik JJ, 2007, SPORTS MED, V37, P117, DOI 10.2165/00007256-200737020-0000; Lai V, 2004, Minerva Stomatol, V53, P4; Manfredi Massimo, 2009, Prog Orthod, V10, P5; Martines F, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P90; Ohlendorf D, 2014, SPINE J, V14, P2384, DOI 10.1016/j.spinee.2014.01.04; Orthlieb JD, 2000, J ORAL REHABIL, V27, P802, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2842.2000.00592.; Packer AC, 2014, J BACK MUSCULOSKELET, V27, P493, DOI 10.3233/BMR-14047; PASSERO PL, 1985, PHYS THER, V65, P1203, DOI 10.1093/ptj/65.8.120; Perinetti G, 2006, GAIT POSTURE, V24, P165, DOI 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2005.07.01; Seifeldin SA, 2015, SAUDI DENT J, V27, P208, DOI 10.1016/j.sdentj.2014.12.00; Sforza C, 2006, CRANIO, V24, P43, DOI 10.1179/crn.2006.00; Smith S D, 1978, N Y State Dent J, V44, P27; Solow B, 1998, EUR J ORTHODONT, V20, P685, DOI 10.1093/ejo/20.6.68; Svensson P, 2005, J OROFAC PAIN, V19, P10; Tecco Simona, 2010, BMC Res Notes, V3, P141, DOI 10.1186/1756-0500-3-14; von Piekartz H, 2013, MANUAL THER, V18, P345, DOI 10.1016/j.math.2012.12.00; Weber Priscila, 2012, J.

Improving this, will depend on earlier diagnosis and treatment. Recently it has been reported that inflammatory markers, particularly the neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet 1 lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and to a lesser extent the mean platelet volume (MPV), may be useful in the early diagnosis and prognostication of various malignancies. Objective: To investigate whether the NLR, PLR and MPV may be useful markers for the early diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma. Materials and methods: We retrospectively studied a group of 36 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, comparing them to healthy age and sex matched controls. Full blood counts were used to obtain various hematological indices, including the MPVs and to calculate the NLRs and the PLRs. Unpaired t-tests were used to determine if these differed between patients and controls. Results: Hemoglobin concentrations and lymphocyte counts were both significantly lower in patients compared to controls (P < 0.001). Neutrophil counts, NLRs, and PLRs were significantly higher in patients than in controls (P = 0.012, <0.001, and <0.001, respectively). MPVs did not differ significantly between patients and controls (P = 0.320) Conclusions: Both NLRs and PLRs may be usefid markers for the early diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma. They are almost universally available and easily obtained.","[Bayhan, Zulfu; Zeren, Sezgin; Duzgun, Sukru Aydin] Dumlupinar Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, Evliya Celebi Campus, TR-43100 Kutahya, Turkey; [Kocak, Fatma Emel] Dumlupinar Univ, Fac Med, Dept Biochem, Kutahya, Turkey; [Ekici, Mehmet Fatih] Evliya Celebi Training & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Kutahya, Turkey; [Kahraman, Cuneyt] Dumlupinar Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Kutahya, Turkey; [Kocak, Cengiz] Dumlupinar Univ, Fac Med, Dept Pathol, Kutahya, Turkey","Bayhan, Z (corresponding author), Dumlupinar Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, Evliya Celebi Campus, TR-43100 Kutahya, Turkey.",,"duzgun, sukru/A-9700-2013; Bayhan, Zulfu/AAB-8502-2020; Kocak, Emel Fatma/F-6055-2011","duzgun, sukru/0000-0003-2095-2167; Bayhan, Zulfu/0000-0002-7587-7267; Kocak, Emel Fatma/0000-0001-5549-3883",,,"Alexandrakis MG, 2003, AM J CLIN ONCOL-CANC, V26, P135, DOI 10.1097/00000421-200304000-0000; Azab B, 2013, MED ONCOL, V30, DOI 10.1007/s12032-012-0432-; Balkwill F, 2001, LANCET, V357, P539, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)04046-; Bayhan Z, 2016, INT SURG, V101, P50, DOI 10.9738/INTSURG-D-15-00123.; Bozkus F, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P10; Cannon NA, 2015, J THORAC ONCOL, V10, P280, DOI 10.1097/JTO.000000000000039; Chai EZP, 2015, BIOCHEM J, V468, P1, DOI 10.1042/BJ2014133; Coussens LM, 2002, NATURE, V420, P860, DOI 10.1038/nature0132; Demirin H, 2011, THROMB RES, V128, P358, DOI 10.1016/j.thromres.2011.05.00; Feng JF, 2014, WORLD J SURG ONCOL, V12, DOI 10.1186/1477-7819-12-5; Fidler IJ, 2003, NAT REV CANCER, V3, P453, DOI 10.1038/nrc109; Graziosi L, 2015, AM J SURG, V209, P333, DOI 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2014.06.01; He WZ, 2013, MED ONCOL, V30, DOI 10.1007/s12032-012-0439-; Inagaki N, 2014, LUNG CANCER, V83, P97, DOI 10.1016/j.lungcan.2013.08.02; Kemal Y, 2014, ASIAN PAC J CANCER P, V15, P2651, DOI 10.7314/APJCP.2014.15.6.265; Kilincalp S, 2015, EUR J CANCER PREV, V24, P328, DOI 10.1097/CEJ.000000000000009; Kurt M, 2012, HEPATO-GASTROENTEROL, V59, P1580, DOI 10.5754/hge1044; Kwon HC, 2012, BIOMARKERS, V17, P216, DOI 10.3109/1354750X.2012.65670; Lai Q, 2014, TRANSPL INT, V27, P32, DOI 10.1111/tri.1219; Li Shumei, 2014, Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi, V36, P91; Li XB, 2015, HEPATO-GASTROENTEROL, V62, P507, DOI 10.5754/hge1492; Nash GF, 2002, LANCET ONCOL, V3, P425, DOI 10.1016/S1470-2045(02)00789-; Paliogiannis P, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P37; Peng W, 2015, J SURG RES, V194, P464, DOI 10.1016/j.jss.2014.12.02; PETRIE HT, 1985, J IMMUNOL, V134, P23; Schreiber RD, 2011, SCIENCE, V331, P1565, DOI 10.1126/science.120348; Seretis C, 2013, AM J SURG, V205, P691, DOI 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2012.08.00; Tuncel T, 2014, ASIAN PAC J CANCER P, V15, P6421, DOI 10.7314/APJCP.2014.15.15.642; Vural V, 2013, TURK J SURG, V29, P1, DOI 10.5152/UCD.2013.0; Xie X, 2016, DIS ESOPHAGUS, V29, P79, DOI 10.1111/dote.1229; Zhang W, 2012, BLOOD, V120, P2889, DOI 10.1182/blood-2012-04-42520; Zhang Y, 2014, INT J GYNECOL CANCER, V24, P1319, DOI 10.1097/IGC.000000000000021; Zu HL, 2015, HEPATO-GASTROENTEROL, V62, P225, DOI 10.5754/hge1380",33,1,1,0,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,111.0,115,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700017,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003409090909090909,2.9640590296817645e-14,0.008789253828015039,0.09596795780582351,0.009035477960663769

Based on the effects of vitamin D on immune system and endocrine system, the relationship between hypothyroidism and vitamin D gained importance. The relationship between vitamin D deficiency and thyroid was suggested for the first time by Kivity and his colleagues. In their study, they found a significant relationship between thyroid autoantibodies and vitamin D levels. In this study we want to show the relationship between autoimmunity and vitamin D deficiency in female patients with hypothyroidism. Materials and methods: This study was performed at the GOP Taksim Education and Research Hospital outpatient department of internal medicine between January and June in 2015. It included 80 females patients, and 18 control females subjects Results: A total of 98 participants were included in this study. The mean durations of hypothyroidism are 5,86 +/- 5,91 vs. 5,43 +/- 5,62 years. Anti-thyroid autoantibodies (Anti TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (anti TG) levels were significantly higher in the group 1 patients compared to the group 2 patients and control subjects (p<0,01). There were no significant differences at other variables between the patients and control subjects. The serum 25-OH vitamin D levels were significantly lower in the Hashimoto thyroiditis and Non-Hashimoto thyroiditis patients compared to the healthy controls (10,88 +/- 9,19 ng/ml vs. 10,53 +/- 6,87 ng/ml, p<0.01). Conclusion: It was thought that the study's being conducted during the winter months might have affected vitamin D levels. The vitamin D value of the control group cases was found to be higher as compared to the case of hypothyroidism associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and of hypothyroidism associated with other reasons. No significant difference was observed in vitamin D levels between the groups of hypothyroidism associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and hypothyroidism associated with other reasons","[Boyuk, Banu; Altay, Murat; Celebi, Aslan; Ekizoglu, Ismail] Gaziosmanpasa Taksim Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Istanbul, Turkey; [Atalay, Hande] Gebze Fatih Devlet Hastanesi, Ic Hastaliklari Anabilim Dali, Kocaeli, Turkey; [Guzel, Savas] Namik Kemal Univ, Dept Biochem, Tekirdag, Turkey","Boyuk, B (corresponding author), Gaziosmanpasa Taksim Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Istanbul, Turkey.",,"BOYUK, BANU/ABA-7026-2021; Boyuk, Banu/GLN-8251-2022; erman, hande/AAZ-7697-2021; erman, hande/AAP-6507-2021","Boyuk, Banu/0000-0001-7794-4411; erman, hande/0000-0001-7213-9624; erman, hande/0000-0001-7213-9624",,,"BHALLA AK, 1983, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V57, P1308, DOI 10.1210/jcem-57-6-130; Bizzaro G, 2015, IMMUNOL RES, V61, P46, DOI 10.1007/s12026-014-8579-; Bozkurt Nujen, 2013, ENDOCR PRACT, V19, P47; Effraimidis G, 2012, EUR J ENDOCRINOL, V167, P43, DOI 10.1530/EJE-12-004; Ergur AT, 2009, VITAMIN DEFICIENCY T, V1, P26; Erkal MZ, 2006, OSTEOPOROSIS INT, V17, P1133, DOI 10.1007/s00198-006-0069-; FOURNIER C, 1990, CLIN IMMUNOL IMMUNOP, V54, P53, DOI 10.1016/0090-1229(90)90005-; Hahn HJ, 1997, TRANSPLANT P, V29, P215; Heaney RP, 2003, AM J CLIN NUTR, V78, P912, DOI 10.1093/ajcn/78.5.91; Holick MF, 2005, J NUTR, V135, p2739S, DOI 10.1093/jn/135.11.2739; Holick MF, 2005, SOUTH MED J, V98, P1024, DOI 10.1097/01.SMJ.0000140865.32054.D; Holick MF, 2011, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V96, P1911, DOI 10.1210/jc.2011-038; Hollowell JG, 2002, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V87, P489, DOI 10.1210/jc.87.2.48; Kivity S, 2011, CELL MOL IMMUNOL, V8, P243, DOI 10.1038/cmi.2010.7; Lin WY, 2006, J CLIN LAB ANAL, V20, P109, DOI 10.1002/jcla.2011; Monaco Fabrizio, 2012, THYROID DIS, P78, DOI [10.1201/b12117, DOI 10.1201/B12117; Pani MA, 2002, EUR J ENDOCRINOL, V146, P777, DOI 10.1530/eje.0.146077; POLS HAP, 1990, J STEROID BIOCHEM, V37, P873, DOI 10.1016/0960-0760(90)90435-; PROVVEDINI DM, 1983, SCIENCE, V221, P1181, DOI 10.1126/science.631074; Tamer G, 2011, THYROID, V21, P891, DOI 10.1089/thy.2009.020; van Driel M, 2006, FASEB J, V20, P2417, DOI 10.1096/fj.06-6374fj",21,1,1,0,7,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,779.0,784,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_89,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400018,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0021694214876033058,1.1377470027913221e-20,0.004128175593578668,0.07200505820656823,0.004128175593578668

Firstly Osteopathy in Italy is not recognized today, despite it being recognized as a profession, it is not considered a medical practice and thus cannot be taught in university faculties of medicine and surgery and the professional figure of an osteopath cannot take part of the hospital staff. This study aims to examine the state of knowledge of the osteopathic profession in the population of pregnant women in relation to the level of study. Materials and methods: The study was performed at the 2nd Family Counseling - Modica Alta USL No. 7 - Ragusa, the counseling Family (ex CT3) - Via G. D'Annunzio 60 - Catania and the hospital of Lentini - District hospital SR2. 288 pregnant women aged between 15 and 42 participated in the research. The gestational average period is 7 months. To Pregnant women was asked to fill out a self-reported, for evaluate their knowledge of the osteopathy Results: The results obtained show that there is a knowledge default of osteopathy as alternative medicine and the benefits that you could have from a manual processing. Conclusion: Complementary and Alternative therapies in Medicine should be considered as treatment options for to ensure a physiological development of the body of woman nine months of pregnancy is continually changing. For this aim, we suggest to encourage projects in osteopathy during pregnancies in family counseling using childbirth courses to inform medical, obstetrician and nurse staff and women. We hope for a successful collaboration among the professional figures that with their passion are dedicated to the prevention and care of the pregnant woman.","[Buscemi, Andrea; Rapisarda, Alessandro] Ctr Studies Osteopathy, Dept Res, Catania, Italy;

Our aim was to determine independent predictors of HRR collected during standard cardio-pulmonary stress test (CPT) in a group of overweight/obese subjects without (N = 14) and with type 2 diabetes (N = 19), as compared to a sample (N = 15) of healthy sedentary subjects. Methods: A graded exercise test on treadmill was performed. Oxygen uptake at rest and at peak exercise (VO(2)max), as well as respiratory exchange ratio at peak exercise was collected. Linear and logistic regression was used to assess association between variables collected at CPT and HRR-I and HRR-II. Results: Age, gender, as well as VO2 and HR at rest were all comparable among groups. VO(2)max and HRmax were both lower in diabetic patients as compared to healthy and overweight/obese groups (20 +/- 4.3 vs. 28 +/- 7 vs. 25.1 +/- 5 ml/Kg/min respectively, p < 0.01). VO(2)max had the highest association to HRR-I (R2=0.47) and HRR-II (R2=0.44); VO(2)max < 28 and VO(2)max < 29 were the most accurate cut-off values to identify subjects with abnormally low HRR-I and HRR-II. Conclusions: VO(2)max is an independent predictor of HRR-I or HRR-II, and it is able to discriminate between patients with normal or abnormally low HRR values. Further studies are warranted to test usefulness of a customized exercise program to ameliorate autonomic nervous system balance, therefore reducing global cardiovascular risk.","[Cataldo, Angelo; Zangla, Daniele; Cerasola, Dario; Traina, Marcello] Univ Palermo, Sport & Exercise Sci DISMOT Res Unit, Via Pascoli 6, I-90144 Palermo, Italy; [Bellavia, Diego] Mediterranean Inst Transplantat & Adv Specialized, Div Cardiovasc Dis, Palermo, Italy","Cataldo, A (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Sport & Exercise Sci DISMOT Res Unit, Via Pascoli 6, I-90144 Palermo, Italy.",,"Zangla, Daniele/AAG-8419-2021; Cataldo, Angelo/AAS-4410-2020; Bellavia, Diego/K-3072-2018","Zangla, Daniele/0000-0003-1643-6960; Cataldo, Angelo/0000-0003-3038-4917; Bellavia, Diego/0000-0003-3808-2868; Traina, Marcello/0000-0003-2373-3621",,,"[Anonymous], 2006, BMI CLASSIFICATIO; Arena R, 2006, AM HEART J, V151, DOI 10.1016/j.ahj.2005.09.01; Cataldo A, 2014, EJSS J, V2, P8; Cheng YLJ, 2003, DIABETES CARE, V26, P2052, DOI 10.2337/diacare.26.7.205; Cole CR, 1999, NEW ENGL J MED, V341, P1351, DOI 10.1056/NEJM19991028341180; DARR KC, 1988, AM J PHYSIOL, V254, pH340, DOI 10.1152/ajpheart.1988.254.2.H34; Dimkpa U, 2009, J EXE PHYSL, V12, P1; DIXON EM, 1992, CARDIOVASC RES, V26, P713, DOI 10.1093/cvr/26.7.71; Du N, 2005, J SPORT SCI MED, V4, P; Fleg JL, 2005, CIRCULATION, V112, P674, DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.54545; IMAI K, 1994, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V24, P1529, DOI 10.1016/0735-1097(94)90150-; Kannankeril PJ, 2004, J INVEST MED, V52, P394, DOI 10.1136/jim-52-06-3; Lahiri MK, 2008, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V51, P1725, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2008.01.03; Myers J, 2002, NEW ENGL J MED, V346, P793, DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa01185; Paoli A, 2015, IRAN J PUBLIC HEALTH, V44, P60; Ribisl PM, 2012, J OBES, V2012, DOI 10.1155/2012/30919; Rosenblueth A, 1934, AM J PHYSIOL, V110, P42, DOI 10.1152/ajplegacy.1934.110.1.4; Sacre JW, 2012, DIABETIC MED, V29, pE312, DOI 10.1111/j.1464-5491.2012.03719.; Shetler K, 2001, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V38, P1980, DOI 10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01652-",19,0,0,1,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,4.0,,,,,889.0,896,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_106,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DY1XF,WOS:000384887000006,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001962809917355372,2.1611304812116646e-08,0.003715742268983118,0.11099517262730618,0.003715742268983118

Tinnitus might be caused by a homeostatic response of central dorsal cochlear nucleus auditory neurons that makes them hyperactive in compensation to auditory input loss. One hypothesis suggests that tinnitus is a sensory form of epilepsy that involves the cochlear nucleus and the inferior colliculus, which display impairment in the electrical activity in the auditory system. This alteration determines a synaptic plasticity in the dorsal cochlear nucleus that becomes a target for pharmacological compounds able to treat tinnitus. There is no effective drug treatment for tinnitus, but different studies propose the use of cannabinoid receptors agonist for their anti-epileptic activity, although their practical effects are still unclear. In this review, we want to analyze the emerging pharmacological approaches of cannabinoid receptor agonists to the therapy of tinnitus.","[Cavallaro, Angela; Cannizzaro, Carla; Lavanco, Gianluca; Brancato, Anna;

Since Mg is considered to be natural physiologic 'calcium (Ca) antagonist', the balance between Ca and Mg seems to be more important to reflect its homoeostasis rather than the measurement of serum Mg level. Material and methods: A total of 92 patients (67 male, mean age 61.19 +/- 13.64 years) with the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome were enrolled into this study. Patients were divided into 2 groups by non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. Clinical and demographic characteristics, and the results of blood samples within 24 hour of admission were evaluated. Results: The mean Ca/Mg ratio for the entire subject cohort on admission was 4.28 +/- 0.53. Although serum Ca level was not statistically significantly different between two groups, the patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were found to have significantly low levels of serum Mg as compared to the non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction group (p = 0.004). Consistently, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was associated with higher Ca/Mg ratio as compared those with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. In multivariate linear regression analysis, acute coronary syndrome presentation (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) (Unstandardized Coefficients B = 0.262; 95%CI=0.048 - 0.476; p=0.017) and serum triglyceride (Unstandardized Coefficients B = -0.002; 95%CI=-0.001 -0.000; p=0.027) were found as independent predictors of serum Ca/Mg ratio. Conclusion: The serum Ca/Mg ratio is higher in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients compared those with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. This could be because of a greater decrease in the levels of Mg than in those of Ca.","[Celik, Murat; Koklu, Mustafa; Gusoy, Erol; Yasar, Salim; Gormel, Suat; Yildirim, Erkan; Gokoglan, Yalcin; Yuksel, Uygar Cagdas; Kabul, Hasan Kutsi; Barcin, Cem] Gulhane Mil Med Acad, Dept Cardiol, Ankara, Turkey; [Gungor, Mutlu] Mem Sisli Hosp, Serv Cardiol, Istanbul, Turkey","Celik, M (corresponding author), Gulhane Mil Med Acad, Dept Cardiol, Cardiol, TR-06018 Etlik, Turkey.",,"yuksel, uygar cagdas/AAA-5958-2021",,,,"AGUS ZS, 1991, ANNU REV PHYSIOL, V53, P299, DOI 10.1146/annurev.physiol.53.1.29; Barbagallo M, 2007, ARCH BIOCHEM BIOPHYS, V458, P40, DOI 10.1016/j.abb.2006.05.00; Dong JF, 2008, THROMB HAEMOSTASIS, V99, P586, DOI 10.1160/TH07-11-069; Elin RJ, 2010, MAGNESIUM RES, V23, pS194, DOI 10.1684/mrh.2010.021; Ferre S, 2010, BBA-MOL BASIS DIS, V1802, P952, DOI 10.1016/j.bbadis.2010.06.01; FLETCHER GF, 1991, AM HEART J, V121, P105, DOI 10.1016/0002-8703(91)90962-; FLINK EB, 1981, ARCH INTERN MED, V141, P441, DOI 10.1001/archinte.141.4.44; Jahnen-Dechent W, 2012, CLIN KIDNEY J, V5, P3, DOI 10.1093/ndtplus/sfr16; King DE, 2009, MAGNESIUM RES, V22, P57, DOI 10.1684/mrh.2009.016; Kumar A, 2009, MAYO CLIN PROC, V84, P917, DOI 10.1016/S0025-6196(11)60509-; Liao FZ, 1998, AM HEART J, V136, P480, DOI 10.1016/S0002-8703(98)70224-; Maier JAM, 2004, BBA-MOL BASIS DIS, V1689, P13, DOI 10.1016/j.bbadis.2004.01.00; Maier JAM, 2004, BBA-MOL BASIS DIS, V1689, P6, DOI 10.1016/j.bbadis.2004.02.00; Mazur A, 2007, ARCH BIOCHEM BIOPHYS, V458, P48, DOI 10.1016/j.abb.2006.03.03; Niemela JE, 1997, J LAB CLIN MED, V129, P89, DOI 10.1016/S0022-2143(97)90165-; Orrenius S, 2003, NAT REV MOL CELL BIO, V4, P552, DOI 10.1038/nrm115; Pearson PJ, 1998, ANN THORAC SURG, V65, P967, DOI 10.1016/S0003-4975(98)00020-; Ramasamy R, 2013, J CLIN DIAGN RES, V7, P817, DOI 10.7860/JCDR/2013/5524.294; Ravn HB, 2001, BLOOD COAGUL FIBRIN, V12, P223, DOI 10.1097/00001721-200106000-0000; Rosanoff A, 2004, J AM COLL NUTR, V23, p501S, DOI 10.1080/07315724.2004.1071938; RUBEIZ GJ, 1993, CRIT CARE MED, V21, P203, DOI 10.1097/00003246-199302000-0001; Saris NEL, 2000, CLIN CHIM ACTA, V294, P1, DOI 10.1016/S0009-8981(99)00258-; Shechter M, 2010, MAGNESIUM RES, V23, P60, DOI 10.1684/mrh.2010.020; Shimosawa Tatsuo, 2005, Clin Calcium, V15, P23; Shivakumar K, 2001, MED HYPOTHESES, V56, P110, DOI 10.1054/mehy.2000.112; SPEICH M, 1980, CLIN CHEM, V26, P166; Tong Garrison M, 2005, J Intensive Care Med, V20, P3, DOI 10.1177/088506660427153; Ueshima K, 2004, HEART VESSELS, V19, P267, DOI 10.1007/s00380-004-0782-; WEISMAN HF, 1988, CIRCULATION, V78, P186, DOI 10.1161/01.CIR.78.1.18; Wolf FI, 2008, MAGNESIUM RES, V21, P5",30,4,4,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,691.0,697,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_76,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400005,,,,,2022-07-14,0.002995867768595041,5.578926958536077e-13,0.005777055036933499,0.07774038886256496,0.005777055036933499

Dry Eye Disease (DED) is characterized by discomfort, visual disturbance, constant irritation, foreign body sensation, and blurred vision. We evaluate in this preliminary report the effect of supplementation with symbiotic Maxiflor on tear film in DED patients. We recruited 40 patients (27 females and 13 males, age 51.5 +/- 11. 1) showing signs of discomfort and / or dry eyes (burning, foreign body sensation, dryness or itching). Following the run-in period subjects were randomized in two groups: group A (N degrees 20 subjects) and group B (N degrees 20 subjects). Group A (control) treated only with substitute tear and group B treated with substitute tear + mixture (symbiotic). The data obtained in the two study groups A and B were, respectively the following: Schirmer 10.1 +/- 0.2 vs 12.7 +/- 0.4 (p < 0.001); Schirmer II 3.6 +/- 0.1 VS 4.6 +/- 0.2 (p<0.001); Fluorescein in break-up time (TF BUT) 4.1 +/- 0.3 vs 6.5 +/- 0.2 (p<0.001). Culture test showed initial bacterial growth in 18 out of 40 samples tested in group A (control), corresponding to 45.0%; whereas bacterial culture was found positive after treatment in 14 out of 40 tests, equal to 35.0%, in group B (symbiotic). A reduction of 16 to 12 strains of aerobic and anaerobic isolates from 10 to 6 has been found. The present study shows that the administration of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus may represent a successful treatment in ameliorating DED.","[Chisari, Giuseppe] Univ Catania, Dept Biomed & Biotechnol Sci, Ctr Ocular Microbiol, I-95124 Catania, Italy; [Rampello, Liborio; Chisari, Clara Grazia] Univ Catania, Dept Neurosci, I-95124 Catania, Italy; [Chisari, Eleonora Margherita] Univ Catania, Dept Educ, I-95124 Catania, Italy; [Catania, Vito Emanuele; Stagni, Edoardo] Univ Catania, Dept Med Surg Sci & Adv Technol GF Ingrassia, I-95124 Catania, Italy; [Greco, Carmen] Univ Catania, Res Ctr Great Senescence, Hosp Cannizzaro, I-95124 Catania, Italy","Chisari, G (corresponding author), Univ Catania, Dept Biomed & Biotechnol Sci, Ctr Ocular Microbiol, I-95124 Catania, Italy.",,,"chisari, clara grazia/0000-0003-1607-543X; CATANIA, Vito Emanuele/0000-0001-5184-5220; CHISARI, Giuseppe/0000-0002-0492-2171",,,"Chisari CG, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P121; Chisari CG, 2014, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V30, P24; Chisari G, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P105; Chisari G, 2013, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V29, P36; Chisari G, 2011, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V27, P7; Chisari G, 2008, CURR CLIN PHARMACOL, V3, P153, DOI 10.2174/15748840878574769; Ferreira CM, 2014, J IMMUNOL RES, V2014, DOI 10.1155/2014/68949; Frazzetto P, 2012, BMC SURG, V12, DOI 10.1186/1471-2482-12-S1-S1; Galvano Fabio, 2010, Front Biosci (Schol Ed), V2, P86; Gill HS, 2001, J CLIN IMMUNOL, V21, P264, DOI 10.1023/A:101097922501; Goldsmith JR, 2014, J GASTROENTEROL, V49, P785, DOI 10.1007/s00535-014-0953-; Ibrahim F, 2010, FEMS IMMUNOL MED MIC, V59, P53, DOI 10.1111/j.1574-695X.2010.00658.; Kaido M, 2012, CORNEA, V31, P1009, DOI 10.1097/ICO.0b013e31823f8cf; Leahy SC, 2005, J APPL MICROBIOL, V98, P1303, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2005.02600.; Magnano M, 2012, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V28, P23; Malaguarnera G, 2015, CLIN OPHTHALMOL, V9, P1437, DOI 10.2147/OPTH.S7753; Malaguarnera G, 2014, WORLD J GASTROENTERO, V20, P16639, DOI 10.3748/wjg.v20.i44.1663; Malaguarnera G, 2013, ANTI-CANCER AGENT ME, V13, P1406, DOI 10.2174/1871520611313666034; Malaguarnera G, 2013, BIOMED RES INT, V2013, DOI 10.1155/2013/94350; Malaguarnera M, 2013, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V29, P79; Malaguarnera M, 2013, BIOMED RES INT, V2013, DOI 10.1155/2013/65098; Malaguarnera M, 2012, J CANCER RES THER, V8, P520, DOI 10.4103/0973-1482.10652; Miljanovic B, 2007, AM J OPHTHALMOL, V143, P409, DOI 10.1016/j.ajo.2006.11.06; Miller KL, 2010, ARCH OPHTHALMOL-CHIC, V128, P94, DOI 10.1001/archophthalmol.2009.35; Moss SE, 2000, ARCH OPHTHALMOL-CHIC, V118, P126; Schiffman RM, 2003, OPHTHALMOLOGY, V110, P1412, DOI 10.1016/S0161-6420(03)00462-; Sekirov I, 2010, PHYSIOL REV, V90, P859, DOI 10.1152/physrev.00045.200; Shanahan F, 2012, GASTROENTEROL CLIN N, V41, P869, DOI 10.1016/j.gtc.2012.08.00; Sheppard John D, 2003, Manag Care, V12, P2; Smith PM, 2013, SCIENCE, V341, P569, DOI 10.1126/science.124116; Uccello M, 2012, BMC SURG, V35, P147; Vinci M, 2001, ANN RHEUM DIS, V60, P42; Vrieze A, 2010, DIABETOLOGIA, V53, P606, DOI 10.1007/s00125-010-1662-; Wopereis H, 2014, PEDIAT ALLERG IMM-UK, V25, P428, DOI 10.1111/pai.1223; Yoon Kyung-Chul, 2004, Korean J Ophthalmol, V18, P16",35,13,14,1,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,4.0,,,,,865.0,870,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_102,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DY1XF,WOS:000384887000002,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003615702479338843,3.849180522212054e-06,0.0028534634346118267,0.09707861562684905,0.0027973187177814094

The aim of this study was to assess the initial clinical experience using third generation of vocal prosthesis (Provox Vega). Materials and method: A retrospective study was carried out with 54 laryngectomized patients during the period 2011-2015. Patients were rehabilitated with indwelling Provox Vega 17 and 20 Fr. Fourteen patients were considered normal patients (Group A); thirteen patients received postoperative radiotherapy (Group B); sixteen patients were categorized as GERD patients (Group C) and eleven subject as elderly patients (Group D). Results: The mean in situ Vega lifetime was 193 days (range: 144-243) in group A, 168 days: (range 125-182) in group B, 123 days (range: 97-134) in group C and 240 days in group D (range: 205-328). Overall, the prosthetic lifetime average was 187.5 days. The Harrison-Robillard-Schultz score, did not show statistically significant differences with the reference groups. Conclusion: The study in question showed an overall better results in terms of lifetime and use, quality and care of the rehabilitation level, but nonetheless comparable with those present in the literature and previously registered, in terms of statistical significance.","[Cocuzza, Salvatore; Serra, Agostino; Gulino, Alessandro; Di Luca, Milena; Follari, Stefania; Campione, Gianluca; Licciardello, Luisa; Maiolino, Luigi; Di Mauro, Paola] Univ Catania, ENT Dept, Via Santa Sofia 78, I-95125 Catania, Italy","Cocuzza, S (corresponding author), Univ Catania, ENT Dept, Via Santa Sofia 78, I-95125 Catania, Italy.",,"Di Mauro, Paola/AAC-1502-2019","Cocuzza, Salvatore/0000-0002-6135-0958",,,"Ackerstaff AH, 1999, ARCH OTOLARYNGOL, V125, P167, DOI 10.1001/archotol.125.2.16; Bozec A, 2010, EUR ARCH OTO-RHINO-L, V267, P751, DOI 10.1007/s00405-009-1138-; Cantu E, 1998, AM J OTOLARYNG, V19, P12, DOI 10.1016/S0196-0709(98)90059-; Chone CT, 2005, OTOLARYNG HEAD NECK, V133, P89, DOI 10.1016/j.otohns.2005.02.01; Cocuzza S, 2014, J VOICE, V28, P245, DOI 10.1016/j.jvoice.2013.08.00; Cocuzza S, 2013, EUR ARCH OTO-RHINO-L, V270, P1879, DOI 10.1007/s00405-013-2430-; Cocuzza S, 2012, EUR ARCH OTO-RHINO-L, V269, P1483, DOI 10.1007/s00405-012-1938-; Cornu AS, 2003, J LARYNGOL OTOL, V117, P56, DOI 10.1258/00222150332104665; Cornu AS, 2003, LARYNGOSCOPE, V120, P113; Delsupehe K, 1998, LARYNGOSCOPE, V108, P1561, DOI 10.1097/00005537-199810000-0002; Free RH, 2003, ACTA OTO-LARYNGOL, V123, P547, DOI 10.1080/003655402100002811; Hancock KL, 2013, EUR ARCH OTO-RHINO-L, V270, P1447, DOI 10.1007/s00405-012-2154-; Herranz Gonzalez-Botas J, 2001, Acta Otorrinolaringol Esp, V52, P22; Hilgers FJM, 2003, ACTA OTO-LARYNGOL, V123, P972, DOI 10.1080/0001648031001537; Hilgers FJM, 2010, LARYNGOSCOPE, V120, P1135, DOI 10.1002/lary.2092; HILGERS JM, 1990, LARYNGOSCOPE, V100, P120; Leder SB, 1997, HEAD NECK-J SCI SPEC, V19, P48; Lequeux T, 2003, J LARYNGOL OTOL, V117, P875, DOI 10.1258/00222150332254288; Lorenz KJ, 2010, HNO, V58, P1174, DOI 10.1007/s00106-010-2169-; Lorenz KJ, 2010, ANN OTO RHINOL LARYN, V119, P719, DOI 10.1177/00034894101190111; Makitie AA, 2003, ANN OTO RHINOL LARYN, V112, P100; Op de Coul BMR, 2000, ARCH OTOLARYNGOL, V126, P1320, DOI 10.1001/archotol.126.11.132; Serra A, 2015, ACTA OTORHINOLARYNGO, V35, P412, DOI 10.14639/0392-100X-68; Serra A, 2016, EUR ARCH OTORHINOLA; Serra A, 2010, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V26, P9; Serra A, 2009, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V25, P12; SHULTZ JR, 1992, ARCH OTOLARYNGOL, V118, P81; SINGER MI, 1986, ANN OTO RHINOL LARYN, V112, P44",28,1,1,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_134,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000005,,,,,2022-07-14,0.002892561983471074,1.1960372213662285e-11,0.005282000565252028,0.10239593801237637,0.0052275779804442325

Holt and Oram first described this syndrome in 1960. Approximately 40% of cases represent new mutations. The syndrome is associated with defective development of cardiac structures that results in atrial septal defect (ASD), most commonly the secundum type; heart block of varying degree; or both. The syndrome is characterized by cardiac malformations and aplasia or hypoplasia of the thumb. The incidence of HOS is estimated at 1: 100,000 live births. In the literature, it is also known as atriodigital syndrome, heart-hand syndrome, upper limb-cardiovascular syndrome, cardiac-limb syndrome, or cardiomelic syndrome. Herein, we report a 22-year-old female case of HOS presenting with the absence of the right radius of the upper limb and ulnar dysplasia, hypoplasia, and kyphoscoliosis along with a large secundum type ASD and carotid artery abnormalities.

The major cause of this disease is the elimination of SMN1 gene exogenous 7 located on telomeric terminal of chromosome 5. The patients at least posses one copy of SMN2 gene which is located on centromeric terminal and is slightly different from the main gene. Methods: In the present study, TDP-43 gene was knocked down in Hela cell line, using siRNA technic and the expression level of mRNA was evaluated in SMN1 gene by semi-quantitative index method and using real-time PCR. Results: After statistical analyses the most important result was significant decrease in level of mRNA expression in SMN1 gene approximately by 6.14 fold. Sanger sequencing method was applied for exact evaluation of total TDP-43 gene length in the patients and carriers. Conclusion: In accordance with involvement of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and brain in ALS and SMA diseases in this survey, it is suggested that the mentioned gene mutation in SMA disease can be effective in regulation of the disease main gene expression.","[Dahaz, Shapour; Orazizadeh, Mahmod] Jundi Shapour Univ, Departement Anat, Ahvaz, Iran; [Saberi, Alihossein] Jundi Shapour Univ, Dept Genet, Ahvaz, Iran; [Mackvandi, Manochehr; Teimorri, Ali; Neysi, Nilofar] Jundi Shapour Univ, Departement Virol, Ahvaz, Iran","Dahaz, S (corresponding author), Jundi Shapour Univ, Departement Anat, Ahvaz, Iran.",shapour1348@gmail.com,"Orazizadeh, Mahmoud/ABG-8317-2020","Orazizadeh, Mahmoud/0000-0002-0485-149X; dahaz, shapour/0000-0001-7701-1072; saberi, Alihossein/0000-0003-4360-9118",,,"[Anonymous], HER MOT SYNDR SMA A; Ayala YM, 2006, FEBS LETT, V580, P1339, DOI 10.1016/j.febslet.2006.01.05; Cartegni L, 2003, NAT STRUCT BIOL, V10, P120, DOI 10.1038/nsb88; Feldkotter M, 2002, AM J HUM GENET, V70, P358, DOI 10.1086/33862; He YW, 2009, CELL MOL LIFE SCI, V66, P1239, DOI 10.1007/s00018-008-8532-; Imlach Wendy L., 2012, SMN IS REQUIRED SENS, V151, P42; Kashima T, 2003, NAT GENET, V34, P460, DOI 10.1038/ng120; Lotti F, 2012, CELL, V151, P440, DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2012.09.01; Macare I. j, 2006, STRUCTURE DICER MEC; Prior TW, 2010, AM J MED GENET A, V152A, P1608, DOI 10.1002/ajmg.a.3347; Sephton CF, 2011, J BIOL CHEM, V286, P1204, DOI 10.1074/jbc.M110.19088; Setola Veronica, 2006, AXONAL SMN A SMN PRO, V10; Wirth B, 2000, HUM MUTAT, V15, P228, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-1004(200003)15:3<228::AID-HUMU3>3.3.CO;2-",13,1,1,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,2.0,,1039.0,1044,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SU,WOS:000390175400034,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001446280991735537,1.8576844498372542e-08,0.002684285395919768,0.1277230204911003,0.002684285395919768

The diagnosis of CJD is a highly challenging issue, as clinical manifestations should be considered along with electroencephalography (EEG), cerebrospinal fluid examination (CSF), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and serum analysis. Cases presentation: we describe two cases of CJD, come to our observation in the same period. In first patient clinical features suggested the diagnosis of Heidenhain's dementia, a rare variant of sporadic CJD, occurring in a 71-year-old woman. She succumbed to the disease within 8 weeks of onset of symptoms and diagnosis was pathologically confirmed. Second patient, a 56-year-old housewife, referred with mood disorders and presenting dementia, ataxia, myoclonic jerks, carried point mutation V2101 at codon 210 of the Prion Protein (PRNP) gene. In both patients protein 14-3-3 in CSF was detected, EEG showed bilaterally periodic sharp and slow-wave discharges, and MRI findings revealed cortex hyper-intensity (ribbon-sign) in DWI and T2W sequences. Conclusions: Our two cases are interesting because the beginning was atypical, namely with visual disturbance previous for several months the definite clinical picture in one case, and in the other with misleading psychiatric disorders.","[Daniela, Graci; Giovanni, Alba; Mario, Cutro; Gaglio, Rosa Maria; Rosa, Avarello; Giacomo, Gurgone] ASP 1 Agrigento, Dept Med, Operat Unit Neurol, Agrigento, Italy; [Gaspare, Borsellino; Riccardo, Mandracchia; Angelo, Trigona] ASP 1 Agrigento, Dept Radiol, Agrigento, Italy","Daniela, G (corresponding author), Osped S Giovanni di Dio, I-92100 Agrigento, Italy.",,,,,,"Aguzzi A, 2008, ANNU REV PATHOL-MECH, V3, P11, DOI 10.1146/annurev.pathmechdis.3.121806.15432; [Anonymous], 1998, Wkly Epidemiol Rec, V73, P36; Castellani RJ, 2004, NEUROLOGY, V63, P436, DOI 10.1212/01.WNL.0000135153.96325.3; Collins SJ, 2006, BRAIN, V129, P2278, DOI 10.1093/brain/awl15; Demaerel P, 2003, J NEUROL, V250, P222, DOI 10.1007/s00415-003-0983-; Fukushima R, 2004, J NEUROL NEUROSUR PS, V75, P485, DOI 10.1136/jnnp.2002.00801; GERTZ HJ, 1988, NEUROLOGY, V38, P1481, DOI 10.1212/WNL.38.9.148; GIBBS CJ, 1968, SCIENCE, V161, P388, DOI 10.1126/science.161.3839.38; HARRIESJONES R, 1988, J NEUROL NEUROSUR PS, V51, P1113, DOI 10.1136/jnnp.51.9.111; Kallenberg K, 2006, AM J NEURORADIOL, V27, P145; Keyrouz SG, 2006, NEUROLOGY, V67, P333, DOI 10.1212/01.wnl.0000208487.18608.4; Krasnianski A, 2006, BRAIN, V129, P2288, DOI 10.1093/brain/awl12; Kropp S, 1999, ARCH NEUROL-CHICAGO, V56, P55, DOI 10.1001/archneur.56.1.5; Legname G, 2004, SCIENCE, V305, P673, DOI 10.1126/science.110019; Manners DN, 2009, NEUROLOGY, V72, P1425, DOI 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181a1884; Meissner B, 2008, AM J NEURORADIOL, V29, P1519, DOI 10.3174/ajnr.A112; Murata T, 2002, AM J NEURORADIOL, V23, P116; PALMER MS, 1991, NATURE, V352, P340, DOI 10.1038/352340a; Parchi P, 1996, ANN NEUROL, V39, P767, DOI 10.1002/ana.41039061; Sanchez-Juan P, 2007, J NEUROL, V254, P901, DOI 10.1007/s00415-006-0472-; Steinhoff BJ, 1996, ARCH NEUROL-CHICAGO, V53, P162, DOI 10.1001/archneur.1996.0055002007401; Stone J, 2003, AM J PSYCHIAT, V160, P391, DOI 10.1176/appi.ajp.160.2.39; Tschampa HJ, 2007, AM J NEURORADIOL, V28, P1114, DOI 10.3174/ajnr.A049; Ukisu R, 2005, AM J ROENTGENOL, V184, P560, DOI 10.2214/ajr.184.2.0184056; Wall CA, 2005, J NEUROPSYCH CLIN N, V17, P489, DOI 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.17.4.48; Will RG, 1996, LANCET, V347, P921, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(96)91412-; Zerr I, 2000, ANN NEUROL, V48, P323, DOI 10.1002/1531-8249(200009)48:3<323::AID-ANA6>3.3.CO;2-; Zerr I, 2000, NEUROLOGY, V55, P811, DOI 10.1212/WNL.55.6.81; Zerr I, 2009, BRAIN, V132, P2659, DOI 10.1093/brain/awp19",29,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,729.0,734,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_81,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400010,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0030991735537190084,1.876335469756682e-08,0.005983068908662273,0.1277769711049804,0.005983068908662273

Despite developments in diagnosis and treatment techniques, the disease may progress after operation despite adjuvant treatment combinations((2)). Thus, early diagnosis is important. In this study, the role of the systemic immune response (SIR) was assessed by the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the thrombocyte/lymphocyte ratio (TLR) in relation to the diagnosis of gastric malignant-benign pathologies performed using upper gastrointestinal system endoscopy. Material and methods: In total, 1916 patients were included in this study, of whom 964 (50.3%) were male and 952 (49.7%) were female. All subject had undergone upper gastrointestinal system endoscopy in the Batman Regional State Hospital Endoscopy Unit between 2010 and 2012. Results: When SIR was evaluated with the NLR, it was positive in 1415 (73.9%) patients. When the patients were grouped based on their pathological diagnosis, there was no relationship between the pathological diagnosis and the SIR determined by the NLR (p=0.629). When SIR was evaluated with the TLR, it was positive in 1450 (75.7%) patients. When the patients were grouped based on their pathological diagnosis, there was no relationship between the pathological diagnosis and the SIR determined by the TLR (p=0.944). Endoscopy is a standard method for the differential diagnosis of gastric pathologies. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that NLR and TLR, which are indicators of the systemic inflammatory response, do not play a role in increasing the diagnostic strength of endoscopy. Additionally, we believe that easily accessible, cheap, and easy-to-use laboratory methods can be developed with further studies on this topic.","[Degirmen, Elif; Akin, Selcuk] Batman Reg Goverment Hosp, Minist Hlth, Dept Biochem, Batman, Turkey; [Yildirim, Mustafa] Medicalpk Gaziantep Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Mucahitler Mh 52063 Sk 2 Sehitkamil, TR-27090 Gaziantep, Turkey; [Dayanan, Ramazan] Batman Reg Govt Hosp, Minist Hlth, Dept Internal Med, Batman, Turkey; [Efe, Savas Cumali] Batman Reg Goverment Hosp, Minist Hlth, Dept Gastroenterol, Batman, Turkey","Yildirim, M (corresponding author), Medicalpk Gaziantep Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Mucahitler Mh 52063 Sk 2 Sehitkamil, TR-27090 Gaziantep, Turkey.",,,,,,"Aliustaoglu M, 2010, MED ONCOL, V27, P1060, DOI 10.1007/s12032-009-9335-; Balkwill F, 2001, LANCET, V357, P539, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)04046-; Bambace NM, 2011, J THROMB HAEMOST, V9, P237, DOI 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2010.04131.; Fogar P, 2006, PANCREAS, V32, P22, DOI 10.1097/01.mpa.0000188305.90290.5; Forrest LM, 2003, BRIT J CANCER, V89, P1028, DOI 10.1038/sj.bjc.660124; GRAHAM DY, 1982, GASTROENTEROLOGY, V82, P22; Halazun KJ, 2008, EJSO-EUR J SURG ONC, V34, P55, DOI 10.1016/j.ejso.2007.02.01; Haruma T, 2015, ANTICANCER RES, V35, P33; Hussein MR, 2005, CANCER BIOL THER, V4, P819, DOI 10.4161/cbt.4.8.186; Liu H, 2014, J VIRAL HEPATITIS, V21, P499, DOI 10.1111/jvh.1216; Macdonald JS, 2001, NEW ENGL J MED, V345, P725, DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa01018; McMillan DC, 2009, CURR OPIN CLIN NUTR, V12, P223, DOI 10.1097/MCO.0b013e32832a790; Olt S, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P72; Ozyalvacli G, 2014, ASIAN PAC J CANCER P, V15, P10363, DOI 10.7314/APJCP.2014.15.23.1036; Parkin DM, 2005, CA-CANCER J CLIN, V55, P74, DOI 10.3322/canjclin.55.2.7; Sharma R, 2008, CLIN COLORECTAL CANC, V7, P331, DOI 10.3816/CCC.2008.n.04; Sharma R, 2008, EUR J CANCER, V44, P251, DOI 10.1016/j.ejca.2007.11.01; Shimada H, 2010, GASTRIC CANCER, V13, P170, DOI 10.1007/s10120-010-0554-; Wiesner T, 2010, CLIN EXP METASTAS, V27, P141, DOI 10.1007/s10585-010-9311-; Xu AM, 2014, AM J CANCER RES, V4, P18; Yamanaka T, 2007, ONCOLOGY-BASEL, V73, P215, DOI 10.1159/00012741; Yilmaz B, 2014, EUR J GASTROEN HEPAT, V26, P1325, DOI 10.1097/MEG.000000000000020",22,0,0,2,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,373.0,376,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000016,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0022727272727272726,1.1729856198783984e-11,0.009575315190115388,0.10857495373226403,0.008866746603171983

Material and methods: We enrolled 288 subjects (169 women, 119 men) who were admitted to Clinic of Internal Medicine, Ankara Education and Research Hospital. They underwent physical examinations and anthropometric evaluation. They also underwent ultrasonography and blood samples were collected for further investigation. After cut-off values for visceral fat were determined, female and male subjects were classified as they were viscerally obese or not obese and all their parameters were compared. Results: Female viscerally obese subjects had statistically higher values of blood glucose, blood pressure, insulin, cholesterol, triglyceride and homeostasis model assessment - insulin resistance index than female Who were not obese. Men with visceral obesity had higher values of blood pressure, insulin, triglyceride and homeostasis model assessment - insulin resistance index than men who were not obese. Conclusions: Visceral obesity was linked to high blood pressure, triglyceride, insulin resistance in all subjects, but high blood glucose, total cholesterol levels were elevated only in females. We think that visceral fat thickness measured by ultrasonography can estimate not only visceral obesity but also risks of cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome both in females and males.","[Demirbas, Berrin] TOBB ETU Univ, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, Ankara, Turkey; [Gursoy, Gul] Kafkas Univ, Dept Internal Med, Kars, Turkey; [Simsek, Meltem; Bahsi, Remzi] Minist Hlth, Dept Internal Med, Ankara, Turkey; [Simsek, Meltem; Bahsi, Remzi] Educ & Res Hosp, Ankara, Turkey; [Kosar, Pinar; Usta, Behice Merve] Minist Hlth, Ankara Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Radiol, Ankara, Turkey","Demirbas, B (corresponding author), Tobb Etu Hosp, Dept Endocrinol, Yasam 5, TR-06510 Ankara, Turkey.",,"Bahşi, Remzi/AAO-9073-2021","bahsi, remzi/0000-0003-1715-6856",,,"Abe Takashi, 1995, Applied Human Science, V14, P13; ARMELLINI F, 1993, INT J OBESITY, V17, P20; ARMELLINI F, 1990, J CLIN ULTRASOUND, V18, P563, DOI 10.1002/jcu.187018070; Berker D, 2010, DIAGN INTERV RADIOL, V16, P99, DOI 10.4261/1305-3825.DIR.2749-09.; BUSETTO L, 1992, INT J OBESITY, V16, P73; Calle EE, 1999, NEW ENGL J MED, V341, P1097, DOI 10.1056/NEJM19991007341150; Coppini LZ, 2005, CURR OPIN CLIN NUTR, V8, P329, DOI 10.1097/01.mco.0000165013.54696.6; DERIDDER CM, 1992, INT J OBESITY, V16, P44; Diaz AA, 2015, CHRON OBSTR PULM DIS, V2, P8, DOI 10.15326/jcopdf.2.1.2015.012; Erem C, 2015, IJC METAB ENDOCR, V8, P38, DOI 10.1016/j.ijcme.2015.07.00; Frayn KN, 2000, BRIT J NUTR, V83, pS71, DOI 10.1017/S000711450000098; Gomi Tatsuya, 2005, Radiat Med, V23, P58; Gong WK, 2007, ASIA PAC J CLIN NUTR, V16, P33; Goodpaster BH, 2003, DIABETES CARE, V26, P372, DOI 10.2337/diacare.26.2.37; Hirooka M, 2005, INTERNAL MED, V44, P794, DOI 10.2169/internalmedicine.44.79; HUBERT HB, 1983, CIRCULATION, V67, P968, DOI 10.1161/01.CIR.67.5.96; KAPLAN NM, 1989, ARCH INTERN MED, V149, P1514, DOI 10.1001/archinte.149.7.151; Kim SK, 2004, AM J CLIN NUTR, V79, P59; Kosus N, 2014, ARCH MED SCI, V10, P739, DOI 10.5114/aoms.2014.4486; Kranendonk MEG, 2015, ATHEROSCLEROSIS, V239, P419, DOI 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2015.01.03; Leite CC, 2002, METABOLISM, V51, P1034, DOI 10.1053/meta.2002.3403; Ng M, 2014, LANCET, V384, P766, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60460-; Ogden CL, 2014, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V311, P806, DOI 10.1001/jama.2014.73; Ohman MK, 2009, CURR VASC PHARMACOL, V7, P169, DOI 10.2174/15701610978745568; REAVEN GM, 1994, J INTERN MED, V236, P1; Ribeiro FF, 2003, OBES RES, V11, P1488, DOI 10.1038/oby.2003.19; Ross R, 2002, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V87, P5044, DOI 10.1210/jc.2002-02057; ROSSNER S, 1990, INT J OBESITY, V14, P89; Satman I, 2013, EUR J EPIDEMIOL, V28, P169, DOI 10.1007/s10654-013-9771-; Shah Ravi V, 2014, JACC Cardiovasc Imaging, V7, P1221, DOI 10.1016/j.jcmg.2014.07.01; Spoto B, 2014, NUTR METAB CARDIOVAS, V24, P1137, DOI 10.1016/j.numecd.2014.04.01; Staten MA, 1998, J PEDIAT CHILD HLTH, V34, P2; Stolk RP, 2001, INT J OBESITY, V25, P1346, DOI 10.1038/sj.ijo.080173; VAGUE J, 1956, AM J CLIN NUTR, V4, P20, DOI 10.1093/ajcn/4.1.2; VANDERKOOY K, 1993, INT J OBESITY, V17, P18; Wajchenberg BL, 2000, ENDOCR REV, V21, P697, DOI 10.1210/er.21.6.69; WHO Consultation, 2000, WHO TECH REP SER, V894, P; Zamboni M, 1998, INT J OBESITY, V22, P655, DOI 10.1038/sj.ijo.080064; ZAMBONI M, 1992, J INTERN MED, V232, P341, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2796.1992.tb00595.",40,1,1,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,45.0,50,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700006,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0040289256198347105,1.6170645465263e-05,0.025447554645822604,0.10471317460489166,0.026052132266479934

Mean platelet volume (MPV) provides a measurement of activated platelets; increasing platelet activation is one of the mechanisms that may link depression and ischemic cardiac disease. Material and method: 100 newly diagnosed patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 100 healthy controls admitted to our outpatient clinics. We started selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment in the MDD patients and followed them for 3 months. Patients' laboratory tests and physical, neurological, and psychiatric examinations were performed both at diagnosis and after 3 months of treatment. Results: The MDD group consisted of 90 people and the control group consisted of 88 people met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. There was no significant difference between the ages of the groups (p = 0.28). There were more males within the MDD group (55.6%). MPV was significantly greater in MDD group (p<0.001); MPV levels showed significantly decline after treatment with SSRIs (p<0.001). The platelet counts were also significantly low in MDD patients when compared with the control group, with the difference being statistically significant (p<0.001). No significant difference was observed in platelet counts after treatment. Severity of depression also declined after treatment. The average Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score decreased 9.23 points; the difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). Conclusion: We conclude that MPV can be an indicator of platelet activity in patients with MDD and SSRIs can be used along with MPV to help identifying and treating coronary artery disease in MDD patients. According to our findings, SSRIs may have an antiplatelet action in addition to their antidepressant effects, which may be beneficial for MDD patients with coronary artery disease.","[Demircan, Fatih] Private Cagri Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Elazig, Turkey; [Gozel, Nevzat] Firat Med Fac, Dept Internal Med, Elazig, Turkey; [Kilinc, Faruk] Dicle Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Diyarbakir, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Musa] Firat Med Fac, Dept Biochem, Elazig, Turkey; [Donder, Emir; Atmaca, Murad] Firat Med Dept Psychiat, Ankara, Turkey","Demircan, F (corresponding author), Private Cagri Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Elazig, Turkey.",,"Atmaca, Murad/V-9377-2018; Donder, Emir/V-8352-2018; faruk, kilinc/W-7108-2018","Gozel, Nevzat/0000-0001-7326-6860; kilinc, faruk/0000-0002-0198-2558; donder, emir/0000-0003-2537-6023",,,"Atar D, 2007, NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOL, V32, P2369, DOI 10.1038/sj.npp.130135; BATH PMW, 1994, CLIN SCI, V87, P253, DOI 10.1042/cs087025; Bromet E, 2011, BMC MED, V9, DOI 10.1186/1741-7015-9-9; Chu H, 2011, EMERG MED J, V28, P569, DOI 10.1136/emj.2010.09309; de Abajo Francisco J., 2011, DRUGS AGING, V28, P34; De Luca G, 2013, BLOOD COAGUL FIBRIN, V24, P619, DOI 10.1097/MBC.0b013e328360c75; Endler G, 2002, BRIT J HAEMATOL, V117, P399, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03441.; Erem C, 2002, J ENDOCRINOL INVEST, V25, P345, DOI 10.1007/BF0334401; Galan A.M., THROMB HAEMOST, V102, P51; Glassman AH, 1998, AM J PSYCHIAT, V155, P4, DOI 10.1176/ajp.155.1.; Hrdina PD, 1997, PSYCHIAT RES, V66, P73, DOI 10.1016/S0165-1781(96)03046-; KARIO K, 1992, CLIN LAB HAEMATOL, V14, P28; KESSLER RC, 1994, ARCH GEN PSYCHIAT, V51, P; Khawaja Imran Shuja, 2009, Psychiatry (Edgmont), V6, P3; Laine-Cessac P, 1998, PHARMACOEPIDEM DR S, V7, pS54, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1557(199808)7:1+<S54::AID-PDS345>3.3.CO;2-; Mendoza-Sotelo J, 2010, PSYCHIAT RES, V176, P179, DOI 10.1016/j.psychres.2009.07.02; Mirzaie Ali Zare, 2012, Med J Islam Repub Iran, V26, P1; MONTGOMERY SA, 1979, BRIT J PSYCHIAT, V134, P382, DOI 10.1192/bjp.134.4.38; Musselman DL, 1996, AM J PSYCHIAT, V153, P131; Nusair Maen, 2012, Mo Med, V109, P19; O'Kearney R, 2009, DEPRESS ANXIETY, V26, P65, DOI 10.1002/da.2050; Pizzi C, 2012, J BIOL REG HOMEOS AG, V26, P77; Schins A, 2004, LIFE SCI, V76, P637, DOI 10.1016/j.lfs.2004.04.06; Serebruany VL, 2001, PHARMACOL RES, V43, P453, DOI 10.1006/phrs.2001.081; WEDZICHA JA, 1988, THORAX, V43, P61, DOI 10.1136/thx.43.1.6; Wozniak G, 2011, MED SCI MONITOR, V17, pRA205, DOI 10.12659/MSM.88192; Zuberi BF, 2008, SINGAP MED J, V49, P11",27,1,1,1,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,93.0,96,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700014,,,,,2022-07-14,0.002892561983471074,1.873984370214686e-08,0.07212783130036776,0.13192504258943782,0.06670073648565067

Radiological features were grouped as increased vascularity, irregular borders, microcalcification, cystic component, presence of hypoechoic halo, hypoechogenicity and extraglandular involvement. Results: The malignancy rates in AUS/FLUS and FN/SFN lesions were 8% and 163%, respectively. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was repeated only in 8 patients among 75 patients diagnosed as AUS/FLUS, but the diagnosis was not changed in direction to follow-up. The presence of irregular borders at ultrasonography, increased vascularity, microcalcification, presence of hypoechoic halo and hypoechoic nodules were found to be related to the malignancy in AUS/FLUS group. On the other hand, age less than 50, presence of irregular borders, increased vascularity and presence of microcalcifications were found to be related to the malignancy in FN/SFN group. Conclusions: The success of BSRTC in prevention of unnecessary thyroidectomies shows differences between clinics. Radiological criteria apart from patient's related factors play an important role in clinical judgement. Microcalcifications seem to be the most sensitive criteria both in AUS/FLUS and FN/SFN lesions. Irregular border was the criteria with the highest specificity in both categories.","[Dogan, Lutfi; Gulcelik, Mehmet Ali; Karaman, Niyazi; Baskan, Emel; Kahraman, Yavuz Selim; Aksel, Bulent; Ozaslan, Cihangir] Ankara Oncol Training & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Angora Evleri Ressamlar Caddesi F6 Blok 8 Beysuke, Ankara, Turkey","Karaman, N (corresponding author), Ankara Oncol Training & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Angora Evleri Ressamlar Caddesi F6 Blok 8 Beysuke, Ankara, Turkey.",,"Baskan, Emel Bulbul/AAH-1388-2021; Dogan, Lutfi/ABI-5044-2020; Ozaslan, Cihangir/ABH-1340-2021","Baskan, Emel Bulbul/0000-0002-0144-3263; Dogan, Lutfi/0000-0002-3834-0911; Ozaslan, Cihangir/0000-0002-2611-4837",,,"Aschebrook-Kilfoy B, 2013, CANCER EPIDEM BIOMAR, V22, P1252, DOI 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-024; Baloch ZW, 2002, DIAGN CYTOPATHOL, V26, P41, DOI 10.1002/dc.1004; Bongiovanni M, 2012, ACTA CYTOL, V56, P333, DOI 10.1159/00033995; Chen AY, 2009, CANCER-AM CANCER SOC, V115, P3801, DOI 10.1002/cncr.2441; Chen JC, 2012, SURGERY, V152, P1037, DOI 10.1016/j.surg.2012.08.05; Cibas ES, 2010, OTOLARYNG CLIN N AM, V43, P257, DOI 10.1016/j.otc.2010.01.00; Cibas ES, 2009, THYROID, V19, P1159, DOI 10.1089/thy.2009.027; Davies L, 2014, JAMA OTOLARYNGOL, V140, P317, DOI 10.1001/jamaoto.2014.; Davies L, 2010, LARYNGOSCOPE, V120, P2446, DOI 10.1002/lary.2107; Faquin WC, 2010, DIAGN CYTOPATHOL, V38, P731, DOI 10.1002/dc.2129; Gulcelik NE, 2008, ARCH OTOLARYNGOL, V134, P1312, DOI 10.1001/archotol.134.12.131; Hegedus L, 2004, NEW ENGL J MED, V351, P1764, DOI 10.1056/NEJMcp03143; Ito Y, 2013, NAT REV ENDOCRINOL, V9, P178, DOI 10.1038/nrendo.2012.25; Koike E, 2001, ARCH SURG-CHICAGO, V136, P334, DOI 10.1001/archsurg.136.3.33; Layfield LJ, 2010, CYTOPATHOLOGY, V21, P75, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2303.2010.00750.; Layfield LJ, 2009, DIAGN CYTOPATHOL, V37, P710, DOI 10.1002/dc.2109; Leenhardt L, 1999, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V84, P24, DOI 10.1210/jc.84.1.2; Luo J, 2012, J SURG RES, V174, P207, DOI 10.1016/j.jss.2011.11.103; Nagarkatti SS, 2013, ANN SURG ONCOL, V20, P60, DOI 10.1245/s10434-012-2601-; Pellegriti G, 2013, J CANCER EPIDEMIOL, V2013, DOI 10.1155/2013/96521; Raber W, 2000, THYROID, V10, P709, DOI 10.1089/1050725005013780; Rago T, 1998, EUR J ENDOCRINOL, V138, P41, DOI 10.1530/eje.0.138004; Rosen JE, 2006, J SURG ONCOL, V94, P649, DOI 10.1002/jso.2070; Sahin M, 2006, CLIN ENDOCRINOL, V65, P514, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2265.2006.02625.; Schlinkert RT, 1997, MAYO CLIN PROC, V72, P913, DOI 10.1016/S0025-6196(11)63360-; Smith JJ, 2013, J AM COLL SURGEONS, V216, P571, DOI 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2012.12.02; Wang D, 2011, ENDOCR-RELAT CANCER, V18, P773, DOI 10.1530/ERC-11-023; Yoder BJ, 2006, THYROID, V16, P781, DOI 10.1089/thy.2006.16.78",28,1,1,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,151.0,155,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700023,,,,,2022-07-14,0.002892561983471074,1.8287396103270625e-08,0.00557101981882904,0.10816730173983977,0.00557101981882904

The purpose of this study was to examine the success rate and the effects of an outpatient weight loss program on obese OSA patients. Materials and methods: This prospective study included 34 apneic obese patients (body mass index 33.7 +/- 5.8 kg/m(2), age 47.1 +/- 8.7 years). Intervention program consisted of 12-week program of moderate intensity exercise (40-60% of HRR) and individualized diet. A weight loss of >= 3% from baseline was considered as clinically significant weight loss according with the guidelines of American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). Polysomnographic, anthropometric and metabolic measurements were taken before and after the significant weight loss. Data were analyzed using the Chi square test, Wilcoxon signed ranks test and Mann Whitney U test. Results: Clinically significant weight loss was achieved by 18 patients (53%), and 16 patients (47%) were unsuccessful. It was significant that mild /moderate OSA patients were mostly successful (68%), while the majority of severe patients (75%) were unsuccessful (P = 0.016). There were significant improvements in anthropometric, metabolic and sleep parameters (apnea-hypopnea index, O-2 desaturation index, Epworth sleepiness score) of successful patients after 12 weeks program. Conclusion: Outpatient weight loss programs are more convenient for patients with mild /moderate OSA. However, obese patients with severe OSA have more barriers to perform exercise. Inpatient weight loss program seems like a better option for obtaining effective weight loss in severe apneic patients.","[Eraslan, Ali] Antalya Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Sports Med, TR-07100 Antalya, Turkey; [Selcuk, Omer Tarik; Eyigor, Hulya; Osma, Ustun] Antalya Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Antalya, Turkey; [Erkal, Zehra] Antalya Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Antalya, Turkey","Eraslan, A (corresponding author), Antalya Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Sports Med, TR-07100 Antalya, Turkey.",,"Selcuk, Omer/AAJ-3450-2021","Selcuk, Omer/0000-0002-7364-7599; Eraslan, Ali/0000-0001-6909-8198",,,"Alberti KGMM, 2009, CIRCULATION, V120, P1640, DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.19264; Ancoli-Israel S, 2007, AASM MANUAL SCORIN; Awad KM, 2012, AM J MED, V125, P485, DOI 10.1016/j.amjmed.2011.11.02; Basta M, 2008, J CLIN SLEEP MED, V4, P1; Beitler JR, 2014, J CLIN SLEEP MED, V10, P1199, DOI 10.5664/jcsm.420; Bonsignore MR, 2013, EUR RESPIR REV, V22, P353, DOI 10.1183/09059180.0000341; Borel AL, 2012, THORAX, V67, P735, DOI 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2011-20100; Chennaoui M, 2015, SLEEP MED REV, V20, P59, DOI 10.1016/j.smrv.2014.06.00; Donnelly JE, 2009, MED SCI SPORT EXER, V41, P459, DOI 10.1249/MSS.0b013e318194933; Frankenfield DC, 1998, J AM DIET ASSOC, V98, P439, DOI 10.1016/S0002-8223(98)00100-; Franklin KA, 2015, J THORAC DIS, V7, P1311, DOI 10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2015.06.1; Garaulet M, 2010, INT J OBESITY, V34, P1667, DOI 10.1038/ijo.2010.11; Greenburg DL, 2009, AM J MED, V122, P535, DOI 10.1016/j.amjmed.2008.10.03; Hora F, 2007, RESPIRATION, V74, P517, DOI 10.1159/00009779; JOHNS MW, 1991, SLEEP, V14, P540, DOI 10.1093/sleep/14.6.54; Jonas S, 2009, ACSMS EXERCISE IS ME, P9; Jonas S, 2009, ACSMS EXERCISE IS ME, P21; Jones SF, 2013, SLEEP MED CLIN, V8, P517, DOI 10.1016/j.jsmc.2013.07.00; Kim TH, 2010, CLIN EXP OTORHINOLAR, V3, P147, DOI 10.3342/ceo.2010.3.3.14; Leone N, 2009, AM J RESP CRIT CARE, V179, P509, DOI 10.1164/rccm.200807-1195O; Mansukhani MP, 2013, AM J CARDIOL, V111, P1650, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2013.02.00; Marshall NS, 2008, SLEEP, V31, P107; Morris JN, 1997, SPORTS MED, V23, P306, DOI 10.2165/00007256-199723050-0000; Netzer NC, 2003, CHEST, V124, P1406, DOI 10.1378/chest.124.4.140; Paoli A, 2015, IRAN J PUBLIC HEALTH, V44, P60; Paoli A, 2012, AM J CARDIOL, V109, P305, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2011.10.01; Papandreou C, 2012, EUR RESPIR J, V39, P1398, DOI 10.1183/09031936.0010341; Peppard PE, 2013, AM J EPIDEMIOL, V177, P1006, DOI 10.1093/aje/kws34; Peppard PE, 2009, AM J RESP CRIT CARE, V180, P788, DOI 10.1164/rccm.200905-0773O; Peppard PE, 2000, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V284, P3015, DOI 10.1001/jama.284.23.301; Potteiger JA, 2012, EUR J APPL PHYSIOL, V112, P2035, DOI 10.1007/s00421-011-2174-; Quercioli A, 2010, SLEEP BREATH, V14, P261, DOI 10.1007/s11325-010-0338-; Shah NA, 2010, SLEEP BREATH, V14, P131, DOI 10.1007/s11325-009-0298-; Smith Simon S, 2007, J Clin Sleep Med, V3, P68; Svatikova Anna, 2005, Curr Diab Rep, V5, P53, DOI 10.1007/s11892-005-0068-; Vgontzas AN, 2003, J INTERN MED, V254, P32, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2796.2003.01177.; Webster AL, 2008, ACSMS HEALTH FIT J, V12, P13, DOI 10.1249/FIT.0b013e31817047b; Young T, 2002, AM J RESP CRIT CARE, V165, P1217, DOI 10.1164/rccm.210908",38,2,2,1,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_153,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000024,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003822314049586777,3.4571062482147235e-05,0.09247743254310495,0.12151797034861095,0.09051457668537724

Since platelets play a fundamental role in the onset of atherosclerosis and coronary clots, assessment of platelet volume indices (PVI) can be important in the prediction and detection of coronary facts. This research was conducted to compare the Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) between patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and healthy individuals. Materials and methods: The study population in this cross-sectional survey included 36 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 36 healthy individuals whose PVIs were compared with each other. After questioning and recording the demographic data of both groups, their blood samples were taken for testing the platelet indices and the results for the MPV were registered in a questionnaire and analyzed using the SPSS software. Findings: the mean and standard deviation for the platelet volume (PV) in patients with AMI and healthy individuals (control group) were +/- 0.95, 10.01 and +/- 0.29, 9.07, respectively. The mean difference in the PV between the two groups was statistically significant (P.value = 0.000). No significant difference was observed between the MPV and the variables of age and gender. Also, no significant differences were observed between the MPV and risk factors for high blood pressure, diabetes, cigarette smoking and body mass index (BMI). Conclusion: This study showed that the MPV is clinically important and a high level of this index can independently be considered as a prognostic factor for cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.","[Fariba, Farnaz] Univ Hamedan, Farshchian Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Hamadan, Iran; [Fariba, Farnaz; Mahboobian, Farzaneh] Univ Hamedan, Farshchian Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Hamadan, Iran","Fariba, F (corresponding author), Univ Hamedan, Farshchian Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Hamadan, Iran.",farnaz.Fariba@gmail.com,"fariba, farnaz/P-5771-2017","fariba, farnaz/0000-0001-7641-2691",,,"American Heart Association, 2004, HEART DIS STROK STA; Coppinger JA, 2004, BLOOD, V103, P2096, DOI 10.1182/blood-2003-08-280; CORASH L, 1977, BLOOD, V49, P7; Dow RB, 1994, AUSTR J MED SCI, V1; Endler G, 2002, BRIT J HAEMATOL, V117, P399, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03441.; ERUSALIMSKY JD, 1993, EUR J CLIN INVEST, V23, P1, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2362.1993.tb00711.; Gawaz M, 2005, J CLIN INVEST, V115, P3378, DOI 10.1172/JCI2719; Gebaiska J, 1993, INT J CARDIOL, V38, P192; KARPATKI.S, 1969, J CLIN INVEST, V48, P1083, DOI 10.1172/JCI10606; KARPATKIN S, 1972, ANN NY ACAD SCI, V201, P262, DOI 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1972.tb16304.; Khandekar MM, 2006, J CLIN PATHOL, V59, P146, DOI 10.1136/jcp.2004.02538; Khode Vitthal, 2012, J Cardiovasc Dis Res, V3, P272, DOI 10.4103/0975-3583.10269; Kilicli-Camur N, 2005, MED SCI MONITOR, V11, pCR38; Longo Dan L, 2012, HARRISONS PRINCIPLES, p[368, 405; Mayda-Domac F, 2010, J STROKE CEREBROVASC, V19, P66, DOI 10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2009.03.00; Neelam B, 2012, J CARDIOVASC DIS RES, V3, P27; Nurcan K C, 2005, MED SCI MONITOR, V11, P38; Schull MJ, 2006, ANN EMERG MED, V48, P647, DOI 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2006.03.02; SELWYN AP, 2001, HARRISONS PRINCIPLES, P139; Shafai, 2005, J BABOL U MED SCI, V2, P4; THAULOW E, 1991, CIRCULATION, V84, P613, DOI 10.1161/01.CIR.84.2.61",21,1,1,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,2.0,,863.0,866,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SU,WOS:000390175400001,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0021694214876033058,1.1700533408307554e-11,0.06853843246133891,0.11210580564466628,0.0631600353310238

This study was performed for evaluating the effect of the chemical compound and antimicrobial activity of Cuminum cyminum seed extract on the inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria in silver carp mince. The extract was extracted from the plant via steam distillation using a Clevenger apparatus. Next, its chemical compound was analyzed using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) instrument. The major compound constituting the Cuminum cyminum extract, was cumin aldehyde (20.27%). The effect of different concentrations of Cuminum cyminum (0%, 0.015%, 0.03%, 09.06%, 0.0% and 0.1%) on the growth behavior of the said bacterium was investigated at 4 degrees C for 21 days. The results showed that the bacteria growth stopped up to 6 days in different concentrations of Cuminum cyminum extract. Also, the effect of Cuminum cyminum extract in controlling the bacterium possessed significant differences (p<0.05). Different concentrations of Cuminum cyminum extract for controlling the growth of the bacterium at the above temperature possessed significant statistical differences compared to the control samples (p<0.05). But low concentrations of the Cuminum cyminum extract (0.015% and 0.03%) did not possess significant differences in inhibiting the growth of the bacterium (p>0.05). Whereas high concentrations of the extract used for inhibiting the growth of the bacteria showed significant statistical differences (p<0.05). Suitable inhibitory effects on the growth of the Staphylococcus aureus in silver carp mince were observed at concentrations of 0.09% and 0.1% of Cuminum cyminum extract. Based on the findings of this research it can be said that the extract of the Cuminum cyminum has strong bactericidal properties and is introduced as a natural food preservative instead of its chemical and industrial variations.","[Faridi, Mehrdad] Univ Zabol, Dept Fisheries, Zabol, Iran; [Rahnama, Mohammad; Eskandani, Majid Alipour] Univ Zabol, Fac Vet Med, Dept Food Hyg, Zabol, Iran","Rahnama, M (corresponding author), Univ Zabol, Fac Vet Med, Dept Food Hyg, Zabol, Iran.",dr_m_rahnama@yahoo.com,,"Saadati, Dariush/0000-0001-9002-1507",,,"Adams R.P, 1995, IDENTIFICATION ESSE; Azimzadeh M., 2009, GENETIC ASSESSMENT ; Bagamboula CF, 2004, FOOD MICROBIOL, V21, P33, DOI 10.1016/S0740-0020(03)00046-; Basti AA, 2007, LWT-FOOD SCI TECHNOL, V40, P973, DOI 10.1016/j.lwt.2006.07.00; Bishop C.

The overall mortality rate of acute pancreatitis is about 5%-10%, but if acute pancreatitis continues to deteriorate, severity of the condition will rise. Therefore, early prediction of severity of the disease is necessary. To fully demonstrate the value of cytokines combined with the BISAP scoring system for early prediction of acute pancreatitis severity, BISAP scoring, traditional Ranson scoring and CT scoring were carried out for 2380 patients with acute pancreatitis admitted in January 2012 to October 2015. Receiver operating curve (ROC) was adopted for accuracy analysis of the three scoring systems. The results show that ROC curve area of BISAP scoring for severity of acute pancreatitis, concurrent symptoms, organ failure and death, etc. enjoys the highest similarity with the actual situation. This fully proves the high clinical value of the BISAP scoring system in early prediction of acute pancreatitis severity, which can provide scientific treatment evidence for medical personnel and improve treatment efficiency.","[Gao, Wei] Shandong Univ, Hosp 2, Dept Intens Care Med, 247 Beiyuan St, Jinan 250033, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xiaoming] Shandong Univ, Hosp 2, Jinan 250033, Peoples R China; [Wu, Dawei] Shandong Univ, Qilu Hosp, Dept Intens Care Med, Jinan 250012, Peoples R China","Gao, W (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Hosp 2, Dept Intens Care Med, 247 Beiyuan St, Jinan 250033, Peoples R China.",,,,,,"Chen Chenyang, 2015, CHINESE J BASES CLIN, V9, P11; Guo Xiaoyan, 2012, CHINESE J GASTROENTE, V15, P109; Lee R., 2015, ASIAN PAC J SURG ONC, V1, P3; Wang LC, 2011, IEEE WIREL COMMUN, V18, P18, DOI 10.1109/MWC.2011.610833; Yu Xianen, 2014, WORLD CHINESE J DIGE, V18, P434; Yung K.

However, the relationship between atherosclerosis and VAT has not yet been adequately studied in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to assess the relationship among VAT, adipokines, and atherosclerosis in patients with CKD. Materials and methods: 45 healthy control, 53 predialysis patients, and 52 hemodialysis patients have been enrolled in the study. Intima media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery, and VAT measurements were evaluated via ultrasonography. Results: IMT (p:0.002), VAT (p:0.021), adiponectin (p<0.001) and pentraxin-3 (p:0.003) were higher in predialysis patients than healthy controls. The values of IMT (p<0.001), VAT (p:0.0014), adiponectin (p:0.005), pentraxin-3 (p: <0.001), C reactive protein (CRP) (p:0.009), triglyceride (p: <0.001) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) (p<0.001), were higher in hemodialysis patients than healthy controls. VAT was positively correlated with CRP(r: 0, 23 p: 0.005), IMT (r: 0.347 p<0.001), body mass index (BMI) (r: 0.33 p<0.001), and negatively correlated with creatinine clearance (R: -0.245 p: 0.003). VAT is independently related with adiponectin (beta:-0.213 p: 0.008), BMI (beta:0.369, P<0.001), and CRP (beta:0.164, P:0.032) in multiple regression analysis. IMT was positively correlated with VAT (r: 0.347 p<0.001), CRP (r: 0.186 p:0.022), age (r: 0.333 p<0.001), BMI (r: 0.444 p<0.001) in all participants. Conclusion: These findings show that VAT is a strong risk factor for atherosclerosis in patients with CKD. However IMT was not correlated with adiponectin, pentraxin-3, and leptin in patients with CKD. Also sonographic measurement of VAT could be useful to stratify the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD.","[Guclu, Aydin] Ahi EvranUniv, Dept Nephrol, Sch Med, Kirsehir, Turkey; [Dursun, Belda] PamukkaleUniv, Dept Nephrol, Sch Med, Denizli, Turkey; [Rota, Simin; Yaman, Fatih] PamukkaleUniv, Dept Biochem, Sch Med, Denizli, Turkey; [Rota, Simin; Yaman, Fatih] PamukkaleUniv, Dept Radiol, Sch Med, Denizli, Turkey","Guclu, A (corresponding author), Ahi EvranUniv, Dept Nephrol, Sch Med, Kirsehir, Turkey.",,"Rota, Simin/AAK-4032-2021; Güçlü, Aydın/AAK-4817-2020","Rota, Simin/0000-0003-3406-3483; ",Pamukkale University Scientific Research Projects Unit [2011TPF019],This study was supported by the Pamukkale University Scientific Research Projects Unit (Project Number 2011TPF019).,"Alexopoulos N, 2014, ATHEROSCLEROSIS, V233, P104, DOI 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2013.12.02; Arita Y, 1999, BIOCHEM BIOPH RES CO, V257, P79, DOI 10.1006/bbrc.1999.025; AUSTIN MA, 1988, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V260, P191; Boehme M, 2007, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V22, P2224, DOI 10.1093/ndt/gfl74; Cao JJ, 2003, CIRCULATION, V108, P166, DOI 10.1161/01.CIR.0000079160.07364.6; Carrero JJ, 2010, CURR OPIN NEPHROL HY, V19, P37, DOI 10.1097/MNH.0b013e328332fc2; Cianciolo G, 2010, MINERVA UROL NEFROL, V62, P5; Ciccone M, 2001, INT J OBESITY, V25, P805, DOI 10.1038/sj.ijo.080162; Cordeiro AC, 2010, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V25, P562, DOI 10.1093/ndt/gfp49; Engeli S, 1999, J HYPERTENS, V17, P555, DOI 10.1097/00004872-199917040-0001; Folsom AR, 2001, AM J CARDIOL, V88, P112, DOI 10.1016/S0002-9149(01)01603-; Go AS, 2004, NEW ENGL J MED, V351, P1296, DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa04103; Guebre-Egziabher F, 2005, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V20, P129, DOI 10.1093/ndt/gfh56; Hall JE, 2003, CURR OPIN NEPHROL HY, V12, P195, DOI 10.1097/00041552-200303000-0001; Heimburger O, 1997, J AM SOC NEPHROL, V8, P142; Jenny NS, 2009, ARTERIOSCL THROM VAS, V29, P594, DOI 10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.17894; Kato A, 2011, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V26, P1967, DOI 10.1093/ndt/gfq65; KAWAGISHI T, 1995, KIDNEY INT, V48, P820, DOI 10.1038/ki.1995.35; Lee MJ, 2012, OBESITY, V20, P1301, DOI 10.1038/oby.2011.24; Malaponte G, 2007, INT J MOL MED, V20, P47; MATTHEWS DR, 1985, DIABETOLOGIA, V28, P412, DOI 10.1007/BF0028088; Nakanishi-Minami T, 2012, DIABETES RES CLIN PR, V95, pE23, DOI 10.1016/j.diabres.2011.10.02; Nasri H, 2006, Minerva Urol Nefrol, V58, P18; Noori N, 2009, J RENAL NUTR, V19, P228, DOI 10.1053/j.jrn.2008.11.00; O'Leary DH, 1999, NEW ENGL J MED, V340, P14, DOI 10.1056/NEJM19990107340010; Odamaki M, 2006, NEPHRON CLIN PRACT, V102, pC8, DOI 10.1159/00008829; Odamaki M, 1999, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V14, P2427, DOI 10.1093/ndt/14.10.242; Okamoto T, 2014, AM J NEPHROL, V39, P122, DOI 10.1159/00035833; Pajvani UB, 2003, J BIOL CHEM, V278, P9073, DOI 10.1074/jbc.M20719820; Pausova Z, 2006, CURR OPIN NEPHROL HY, V15, P173, DOI 10.1097/01.mnh.0000214775.42103.a; Pinto-Sietsma SJ, 2003, AM J KIDNEY DIS, V41, P733, DOI 10.1016/S0272-6386(03)00020-; Pischon T, 2004, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V291, P1730, DOI 10.1001/jama.291.14.173; Rondinone CM, 2006, ENDOCRINE, V29, P81, DOI 10.1385/ENDO:29:1:8; Rubio-Guerra AF, 2013, CARDIOLOGY, V125, P150, DOI 10.1159/00034865; St-Pierre AC, 2005, ARTERIOSCL THROM VAS, V25, P553, DOI 10.1161/01.ATV.0000154144.73236.f; Stenvinkel P, 1997, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V12, P1321, DOI 10.1093/ndt/12.7.132; Sugerman H, 1997, J INTERN MED, V241, P71, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2796.1997.89104000.; Tong M, 2007, CLIN J AM SOC NEPHRO, V2, P889, DOI 10.2215/CJN.0087020; Witasp A, 2011, J INTERN MED, V269, P410, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2010.02293.; Yamauchi T, 2003, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V18, P1842, DOI 10.1093/ndt/gfg26; Yusuf S, 2005, LANCET, V366, P1640, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67663-; Zoccali C, 2000, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V15, P454, DOI 10.1093/ndt/15.4.45; Zoccali C, 2003, KIDNEY INT, V63, pS98, DOI 10.1046/j.1523-1755.63.s84.49.; Zoccali C, 2002, J AM SOC NEPHROL, V13, P134, DOI 10.1681/ASN.V13113",44,1,1,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1843.0,1849,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_172,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300016,,,,,2022-07-14,0.004545454545454545,9.091539569648665e-14,0.008865021743418272,0.09131127901821509,0.008865021743418272

Platelet activation might be related with the pathophysiology of Behcet's disease (BD) since this disease is also prone to inflammation and thrombosis. We aimed to determine whether MPV can be used as a marker for BD in disease activation and severity. Materials and methods: The data of 33 BD patients during the active and the inactive periods of the disease were collected retrospectively, and the results were then compared with 35 recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) patients and 60 healthy controls who were age- and gender-matched. If at least two clinical findings were present, BD was considered to be active. Results: In the active period of BD, the MPV levels (8,6 fL) were slightly higher than those in RAS (8,4 fL) and control groups (8,4 fL) (p=0,148), however, the MPV levels of active period (8.66 fL) were significantly higher than the inactive period (83 fL), (p=0.007). Moreover, 8 BD patients with vascular event history had significantly higher levels of MPV during active (9,3 fL) than inactive period (7,3 fL) of the disease (p=0,012). Conclusion: In conclusion, elevation of MPV levels should be considered for each patient individually, and during follow-ups MPV measurements can be valuable to determine disease activity. Additionally, an elevation in MPV could alarm clinician as BD is getting activated and that there might be an increased risk of vascular involvement with BD.","[Gunduz, Ozge; Gurler, Aysel; Erdogan, Fatma G.] Ufuk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Dermatol, Dermatol, TR-06520 Ankara, Turkey; [Ayanoglu, Burcu T.] Aksaray State Hosp, Dept Dermatol, Aksaray, Turkey; [Alhan, Aslihan] Ufuk Univ, Fac Arts & Sci, Dept Stat, Stat, TR-06520 Ankara, Turkey","Gunduz, O (corresponding author), Ufuk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Dermatol, TR-06520 Ankara, Turkey.",,,"Gunduz, Ozge/0000-0001-8541-9246",,,"Acikgoz N, 2010, TOHOKU J EXP MED, V221, P119, DOI 10.1620/tjem.221.11; Adam B, 2004, J EUR ACAD DERMATOL, V18, P318, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-3083.2004.00907.; Akar S, 2006, CLIN APPL THROMB-HEM, V12, P451, DOI 10.1177/107602960629343; Balta I, 2014, J EUR ACAD DERMATOL, V28, P1388, DOI 10.1111/jdv.1229; Beyan C, 2012, CLIN APPL THROMB-HEM, V18, P670, DOI 10.1177/107602961245278; Buttarello M, 2008, AM J CLIN PATHOL, V130, P104, DOI 10.1309/EK3C7CTDKNVPXVT; Chavan M, 2012, J ORAL PATHOL MED, V41, P577, DOI 10.1111/j.1600-0714.2012.01134.; Colkesen Y, 2012, CLIN CHEM LAB MED, V50, P631, DOI 10.1515/CCLM.2011.80; Ekiz O, 2014, ANGIOLOGY, V65, P161, DOI 10.1177/000331971349237; Emmi G, 2014, INTERN EMERG MED, V9, P257, DOI 10.1007/s11739-013-1036-; Gaffo AL, 2013, BEST PRACT RES CL RH, V27, P57, DOI 10.1016/j.berh.2012.12.00; Gasparyan AY, 2011, CURR PHARM DESIGN, V17, P4; Kiraz S, 2002, THROMB RES, V105, P125, DOI 10.1016/S0049-3848(02)00006-; Kurzrock R, 2005, CLIN CANCER RES, V11, P1361, DOI 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-109; Lance Marcus D, 2010, Lab Hematol, V16, P28, DOI 10.1532/LH96.1001; Lee WS, 2010, TOHOKU J EXP MED, V222, P225, DOI 10.1620/tjem.222.22; Mat C, 2013, CLIN DERMATOL, V31, P352, DOI 10.1016/j.clindermatol.2013.01.00; SILMAN AJ, 1990, LANCET, V335, P107; Turkcu FM, 2013, SCI WORLD J, DOI 10.1155/2013/21591; vanderLoo B, 1997, BAILLIERE CLIN HAEM, V10, P109, DOI 10.1016/S0950-3536(97)80053-; Yazici S, 2010, PLATELETS, V21, P122, DOI 10.3109/0953710090347437",21,2,2,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,805.0,809,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_94,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400023,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0021694214876033058,1.7013916428774255e-20,0.009474546154706576,0.07376530744435215,0.009474546154706576

The aim of this study was to determine whether PACTOIR predict the thrombolytic therapy in the treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE). Materials and methods: This retrospective study was conducted by reviewing charts of 52 patients (aged >= 18 years) who were admitted to our emergency department (ED) with initial diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and confirmed diagnosis of PE by Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CPTA). The patients were divided into two groups as follows: Group 1 (n=14) consisted of the patients who received thrombolytic therapy and Group 2 (n=38) consisted of the patients who did not receive thrombolytic therapy. PACTOIR was calculated in both groups to estimate thrombus load. We evaluated the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy by comparing the levels of D-dieter and Troponin I. Results: Mean value for PACTOIR, D-dimer and Troponin I levels were 56.4 (%), 6.21 (mg/L) and 0.35 (mu g-IL) in Group 1 whereas they were 20.46 (%), 220 (mg/L) and 0.11 (mu g/L) in Group 2, respectively. Significant difference was detected between Group 1 and Group 2 (p<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity values were calculated as 92.9% and 89.5% for PACTOIR, whereas they were 85.7% and 78.9% for D-dimer, respectively. These values were found to be 78.6% and 65.8% for Troponin I, respectively. Conclusion: Based on our results, sensitivity to show PE severity and to determine thrombolytic therapy was significant when compared to D-dimer and Troponin I. In addition, we concluded that PACTOIR is the parameter with greatest sensitivity in determining the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy.","[Guzel, Murat; Atay, Erdi] Samsun Training & Res Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Samsun, Turkey; [Soylu, Aysegul Idil] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Radiol, Samsun, Turkey; [Salt, Omer] Trakya Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Edirne, Turkey; [Erenler, Ali Kemal] Hitit Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Corum, Turkey; [Tomak, Leman] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Med Biostat, Samsun, Turkey; [Aksu, Esra Arslan] Samsun Training & Res Hosp, Dept Chest Dis, Samsun, Turkey; [Baydin, Ahmet] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Samsun, Turkey","Guzel, M (corresponding author), Samsun Training & Res Hosp, Baris Bulvari Kadikoy Mahallesi 199, Ilkadim Samsun, Turkey.",,"güzel, murat/Q-3326-2016; Erenler, Ali Kemal/AAA-2995-2020; BAYDIN, AHMET/AAG-4188-2019","BAYDIN, AHMET/0000-0003-4987-0878",,,"Barclay L., MEDSCAP; Becattini C, 2007, CIRCULATION, V116, P427, DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.68042; Bloomer Tyler L, 2015, Crit Pathw Cardiol, V14, P90, DOI 10.1097/HPC.000000000000004; CARSON JL, 1992, NEW ENGL J MED, V326, P1240, DOI 10.1056/NEJM19920507326190; Chaosuwannakit Narumol, 2012, Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand, V95, P145; Collomb D, 2003, EUR RADIOL, V13, P1508, DOI 10.1007/s00330-002-1804-; Elliott CG, 2014, NEW ENGL J MED, V370, P1457, DOI 10.1056/NEJMe140102; Jeebun V, 2010, QJM-INT J MED, V103, P91, DOI 10.1093/qjmed/hcp16; Ji YQ, 2014, CHINESE MED J-PEKING, V127, P2025, DOI 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0366-6999.2013302; Kearon C, 2012, AM COLL CHEST PHYS S, V141, P41; Kline JA, 2006, ROSENS EMERGENCY MED, P136; Lankeit M, 2011, CIRCULATION, V124, P2716, DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.05117; Matsuoka S, 2006, AM J ROENTGENOL, V186, P1272, DOI 10.2214/AJR.05.004; Metafratzi ZM, 2006, AM J ROENTGENOL, V186, P213, DOI 10.2214/AJR.04.132; Meyer G, 2014, NEW ENGL J MED, V370, P1402, DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa130209; Ozsu S, 2011, AM J EMERG MED, V29, P26, DOI 10.1016/j.ajem.2009.07.00; Patel S, 2003, RADIOLOGY, V227, P455, DOI 10.1148/radiol.227201113; Qanadli SD, 2001, AM J ROENTGENOL, V176, P1415, DOI 10.2214/ajr.176.6.176141; Vedovati MC, 2013, J THROMB HAEMOST, V11, P2092, DOI 10.1111/jth.1242; Wu AS, 2004, RADIOLOGY, V230, P831, DOI 10.1148/radiol.230303008; Yasui T, 2007, CIRC J, V71, P1948, DOI 10.1253/circj.71.194",21,0,0,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,811.0,815,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_95,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400024,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0021694214876033058,2.027455664935047e-20,0.004128175593578668,0.07162041181736795,0.004128175593578668

Recently, there has been an increased attention to bulky breads because modern methods of processing and baking dough are in a way through which bread waste is reduced and they result in longer lasting of bread and preserve bread vitamins and proteins. Moreover, having additives in baking industry has also become more common. So that, they are generally used to improve the quality, to enhance efficiency and ease of working with dough, to delay staling, and hence to reduce waste. Neural Networks are a branch of artificial intelligence with computer algorithms on different classification and pattern recognition, parameter estimation, and so on. The aim of this research study was to use artificial network in order to predict appropriate models for the effect of adding hydrocolloids on baguette bread staling.

Two nosocomial transmissions were reported from two hospitals of Mashhad in the last 4 years. The aim of this study was to assess the role of preventive measures on disease prevention among Health Care Workers (HCWs) who are in contact with confirmed CCHF cases. Methodology: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in the infectious ward of a referral hospital in North-East of Iran. During 2009 to 2012 about 45 confirmed cases of CCHF were admitted to this hospital. 44 HCWs who had contact with these cases were included in this study. Participants were questioned regarding taking preventive measures including the use of gloves, gown, shield, mask, and shoe cover. Sera samples were also collected 2 months after the last CCHF case admission and were checked for anti-CCHF IgM and IgG. Results: All study participants had a history of close contact with confirmed CCHF patients. The contacts were due to daily visits and examination, suction of secretions, intubation, taking blood samples, administering drugs, contact with the patients' clothes, and performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The adherence rate to universal precautions was fairly good and anti-CCHF IgM and IgG results were negative in all subjects. Conclusion: The findings of our study further prove that protective measures are highly effective in preventing CCHF transmission in HCWs.","[Hassaniazad, Mehdi] Hormozgan Univ Med Sci, Infect Dis Res Ctr Infect & Trop, Bandar Abbas, Iran; [Bojdi, Amin; Abedi, Farshid] Mashhad Univ Med Sci, Infect Dis, Mashhad, Iran; [Chinikar, Sadegh] Inst Iran, VHFs Lab, Natl Ref Lab, Mashhad, Iran; [Bazaz, Seyed Mojtaba Mousavi] Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Dept Med Educ, Mashhad, Iran","Abedi, F (corresponding author), Mashhad Univ Med Sci, Infect Dis, Mashhad, Iran.",AbediF@mums.ac.ir,"CHINIKAR, Sadegh/AAH-8155-2019; abedi, farshid/O-3402-2017; Hassaniazad, Mehdi/H-3409-2017","Hassaniazad, Mehdi/0000-0003-3924-2069",,,"Athar MN, 2005, AM J TROP MED HYG, V72, P471, DOI 10.4269/ajtmh.2005.72.47; BURNEY MI, 1980, AM J TROP MED HYG, V29, P941, DOI 10.4269/ajtmh.1980.29.94; Chinikar S, 2012, NOSOCOMIAL INFECT C; Ergonul O, 2006, LANCET INFECT DIS, V6, P203, DOI 10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70435-; Ergonul Onder, 2007, P207, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4020-6106-6_1; Ergonul O, 2007, INT J INFECT DIS, V11, P48, DOI 10.1016/j.ijid.2005.10.00; Ergonul O, 2012, CURR OPIN VIROL, V2, P215, DOI 10.1016/j.coviro.2012.03.00; GOLDFARB LG, 1980, AM J TROP MED HYG, V29, P260, DOI 10.4269/ajtmh.1980.29.26; HOOGSTRAAL H, 1979, J MED ENTOMOL, V15, P307, DOI 10.1093/jmedent/15.4.30; Izadi S, 2008, JPN J INFECT DIS, V61, P49; mostafavi ehsan, 2013, AM J TROPICAL MED HY, V1; Naderi HR, 2011, EPIDEMIOL INFECT, V139, P862, DOI 10.1017/S095026881000200; Naderi H, 2013, AM J TROP MED HYG, V88, P469, DOI 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.12-033; Papa A, 2002, EUR J CLIN MICROBIOL, V21, P603, DOI 10.1007/s10096-002-0770-; Tarantola Arnaud, 2007, P281, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4020-6106-6_2; Watts DM, 1988, ARBOVIRUSES EPIDEMI",16,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,5.0,,2017.0,2020,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YW,WOS:000392283800019,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001652892561983471,1.7135301454905964e-20,0.0029926956082251288,0.07470230975220132,0.002992428511699389

Sensitivity and specificity of parameters such as CRP (C-reactive protein), erythrocyte sedimentation rate and WBC (white blood cell), which are among the classical markers of systemic inflammation, were reported to have limited benefit in patients with these types of bacterial infections. PCT (procalcitonin) has been a focus of interest as a specific and early marker in systemic inflammation, sepsis and infections especially in recent years. In this study, we aimed to evaluate potential usability of PCT in distinction of systemic and localized bacterial infections in patients who are followed up in ICU and to compare CRP, WBC and MPV (mean platelet volume) values in patients with systemic and localized bacterial infections. Materials and methods: Totally 52 patients who were followed in Adult ICU of our hospital were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of patients with growth in blood culture and systemic bacterial infection clinic. Group 2 consisted of patients with growth in phlegm, tracheal aspirate, wound and urine culture without growth in blood culture. Age, gender growth region and growing microorganisms, simultaneously checked CRP, PCT, WBC, MPV values were recorded in follow-up form. Results: The study showed that PCT value was significantly high in systemic infections, while other parameters did not show a significant difference between the two groups. Furthermore, Acinetobacter baumannii was found to be the most common agent. Conclusion: Our study suggests that PCT value has a more valuable potential than other standard infection parameters in distinction of systemic infection and localized bacterial infection in patients who are followed in ICU. However, we believe that more comprehensive studies with a larger sampling can guide the clinicians for early diagnosis and treatment.","[Inci, A.] Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Training & Res Hosp, Dept Infect Dis & Clin Microbiol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Demiraran, Y.] Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Training & Res Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol & Intens Care, Istanbul, Turkey; [Erus, S.; Yaprak, U.] Koc Univ, Fac Med, Dept Thorac Surg, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ocak, T.; Akman, C.; Basturk, M.; Kalafat, U.

Lack of ripening of the cervix is considered to be one of the problems of delivery. Thus, the present research was designed to determine the effect of oral evening primrose capsules on the ripening of cervix in nulliparous women. Materials and methods: This research has been conducted with the triple-blind randomized trial method on 80 nulliparous women in the 40th week of pregnancy (6th day + 40 weeks) visiting the prenatal clinic Prenatal clinic Shahid Akbarabadi educational and medical center of Iran University of Medical Sciences in 2015. Samples were divided into two equal groups of medicine and placebo with the randomized allocation method. Each of the participants took a bottle containing 14 1000mg oral evening primrose capsules (2 capsules per day, each 12 twelve hours for a week) or the placebo containing 14 1000mg oral capsules of paraffin in similar bottles. Data collecting tools include: demographic specifications questionnaire and the form of the records of the examinations. Data was analyzed through statistical tests and SPSS software version 16 using descriptive inferential statistic. Findings: Similarity of the two groups in terms of individual specifications and Bishop Score before the intervention were reviewed in the two groups and no significant statistical difference was seen between the two groups. The mean of the Bishop score for those who had taken 10 or more capsules after the intervention did not show a statistically significant difference (p=0.110). Conclusion: Consumption of evening primrose did not show a considerable improvement in the score. It is recommended to do more comparative studies in this field in later weeks of pregnancy due to the conflicts of the studies.","[Kalati, Mahnaz] Iran Univ Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery Fac, Int Campus, Tehran, Iran; [Kashanian, Maryam] Iran Univ Med Sci, Dept Obstet & Midwifery, Tehran, Iran; [Naseri, Mohsen] Shahed Univ, Tradit Med, Tehran, Iran; [Naseri, Mohsen] Shahed Univ, Res Ctr Randomized Trial Tradit Med, Tehran, Iran; [Haghani, Hamid] Univ Med Sci, Fac Management, Biostat, Tehran, Iran","Kalati, M (corresponding author), Iran Univ Med Sci, Sch Nursing & Midwifery Fac, Int Campus, Tehran, Iran.",mahnazkalati77@yahoo.com,"jahdi, fereshteh/I-3132-2017","jahdi, fereshteh/0000-0002-7018-4744",Iran University of Medical Sciences of International Pardis,"Authors sincerely thank the respected deputy of research unit of Iran University of Medical Sciences of International Pardis for their financial support.

Therefore, screening for cervical cancer is considered an effective method in early diagnosis and treatment of this condition. Here, we studied screening tests results to determine the frequency of abnormal cervical cytologic findings. Methods: This study had two phases. The first phase was conducted from March 2007 to March 2008 (400 subjects). The second phase lasted from March 2011 to March 2012 (208 subjects). All infertile women (either primary causes or secondary ones) who presented to our university infertility clinic to receive treatments were included. Results: Cervical cytology reports were unsatisfactory in 10 subjects (1.7%) and abnormal in three patients (0.5%). Most cases whose reports were unsatisfactory were documented in the first phase of the study (i.e., 9 patients, 90%). Conclusion: Cervical screening with Pap smear enables early diagnosis and management of cervical abnormalities and consequently a decrease in the rate of invasive cervical cancers. It is suggested to conduct studies with larger sample sizes to ensure the beneficial effects of cervical screening.","[Jalilian, Nasrin; Veisi, Firoozeh; Rezavand, Negin] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Matern Res Ctr, Kermanshah, Iran","Rezavand, N (corresponding author), Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Matern Res Ctr, Kermanshah, Iran.",nRezavand@kums.ac.ir,"Rezavand, Negin/Q-9181-2017; Jalilian, Nasrin/H-6119-2017","rezavand, negin/0000-0002-7978-106X",,,"Al Jaroudi D, 2010, ANN SAUDI MED, V30, P397, DOI 10.4103/0256-4947.6855; Almasi-Nokiani F, 2009, HAKIM RES J, V11, P2; Anguenot JL, 2001, HUM REPROD, V16, P2206, DOI 10.1093/humrep/16.10.220; [Anonymous], 2008, PRINC PREV SURV NON; Brown DR, 2005, J INFECT DIS, V191, P182, DOI 10.1086/42686; CancerIAfro, CERV CANC INC MORT ; Chism A, 2015, FERTILITY PRESERVAT; Clifford GM, 2003, BRIT J CANCER, V88, P63, DOI 10.1038/sj.bjc.660068; Cuschieri KS, 2005, J CLIN PATHOL, V58, P946, DOI 10.1136/jcp.2004.02286; Franco EL, 2001, CAN MED ASSOC J, V164, P101; Ghaffari Saeed Reza, 2006, Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, V7, P52; HULL MGR, 1985, BRIT MED J, V291, P1693, DOI 10.1136/bmj.291.6510.169; JALILIAN N, 2013, LIFE SCI J, V10, P22; Mari N, BMC CANC, V1; Pisani P, 1999, INT J CANCER, V83, P18, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19990924)83:1&lt;18::AID-IJC5&gt;3.0.CO;2-; Plante M, 2014, PATIENT INFORM FERT; REMMINK AJ, 1995, INT J CANCER, V61, P306, DOI 10.1002/ijc.291061030; Shafaghi B, 2013, HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIR; van Hamont D, 2006, HUM REPROD, V21, P2359, DOI 10.1093/humrep/del13; Walboomers JMM, 1999, J PATHOL, V189, P12, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199909)189:1&lt;12::AID-PATH431&gt;3.0.CO;2-; Wallin KL, 1999, NEW ENGL J MED, V341, P1633, DOI 10.1056/NEJM19991125341220",21,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,2.0,,905.0,908,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SU,WOS:000390175400008,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0025826446280991736,1.8740069103358054e-08,0.004794033090297731,0.12776010664273366,0.004794033090297731

The present study aimed to assess the effect of Community Re-Entry Program on social function of patients with chronic mental disorders. Methods: In this study, 40 patients with chronic mental disorders referring to outpatient rehabilitation centers of Hamadan, Iran were randomly divided into an intervention (N=20) and a control (N=20) group. The intervention group received community rehabilitation program in 16 60-90-minute educational sessions held twice a week for two months. The control group, on the other hand, took part in the center's routine occupational therapy. Both groups were evaluated using Assessment of Communication and Interaction Skills (ACIS) questionnaire before and after the intervention. Results: The results showed a significant change in physicality (P<0.02), information exchange (P<0.02), and total score of ACIS questionnaire (P<0.01) in the intervention group compared to the control group after the intervention. However, no significant difference was found between the two groups concerning relations (P<0.09). Conclusion: The results showed that Community Re-Entry Program played an important role in improving social function among patients with chronic mental disorders.

Deregulation of HGF/cMET system by different biological mechanisms may contribute to the minor development in many types of cancers. Therefore, the present study was performed to investigate clinical significance of serum patterns of both HGF and cMET in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Materials and methods: One hundred and three CRC patients were enrolled in this study. Serum HGF and cMET levels were measured by the solid-phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Age- and sex-matched 30 healthy control patients were included in the analysis. Results: The median age of the patients was 60 years old, range 24 to 84 years. Most of the tumor localization areas were colon (n = 57, 55%). Median follow-up time was 14 months. While thirty-one patients (30 %) experienced disease progression, twenty-three of the remaining patients (22 %) died because of the disease. The estimated 2-year overall (OS) and 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates for the whole patient groups were 70.1 % (95% confidence interval (CI) = 57.2-83.0) and 233 % (95% CI = 82-38.4), respectively. The baseline median serum HGF and cMET levels were significantly higher in metastatic CRC patients than in the healthy control group (p<0.001). Furthermore, worse performance status and metastatic disease were associated with higher serum HGF concentrations all patients with CRC (p=0.03 and p=0.03, respectively). Clinical variables including metastatic disease, greater pathologic tumor status, and colonic site were found to be correlated with higher serum cMET concentrations all patients with CRC (p=0.01, p=0.05, and p=0.04, respectively). A correlation was determined between HGF and cMET levels in metastatic CRC patients (rs=0.286, n=47, and p=0.05), (Spearman's correlation). Our study results did not show a statistically significant serum HGF and cMET concentrations regarding PFS and OS. Conclusion: Serum levels of HGF and cMET may be diagnostic markers in CRC patients. However; their predictive and prognostic values were not determined.","[Karabulut, Mehmet; Alis, Halil; Kones, Osman; Seyit, Hakan] Istanbul Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Gen Surg, Istanbul, Turkey; [Gunaldi, Meral] Istanbul Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Afsar, Cigdem Usul] Istanbul Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Karabulut, Senem; Aykan, Nuri Faruk] Istanbul Univ, Fac Med, Inst Oncol, Dept Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Serilmez, Murat] Istanbul Univ, Fac Med, Inst Oncol, Dept Basic Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey","Karabulut, M (corresponding author), Istanbul Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Gen Surg, Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Afsar, Cigdem Usul/C-3436-2015; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/AAA-6103-2021; Serilmez, Murat/V-6153-2018; karabulut, senem/AAT-3594-2020; Alis, Halil/AAJ-6721-2020; Gunaldi, Meral/Z-1463-2018; Aykan, Nuri Faruk/I-6425-2019; Seyit, Hakan/AAJ-7050-2020","Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639; Serilmez, Murat/0000-0001-8502-2505; Aykan, Nuri Faruk/0000-0002-5472-3218; ",,,"Ajisaka H, 1998, Nihon Shokakibyo Gakkai Zasshi, V95, P75; Corso S, 2013, CANCER DISCOV, V3, P978, DOI 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-004; Dang H, 2015, BMC CANCER, V15, DOI 10.1186/s12885-015-1166-; Elliott VA, 2014, PLOS ONE, V9, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.009743; Engelman JA, 2007, SCIENCE, V316, P1039, DOI 10.1126/science.114147; Galimi F, 2011, CLIN CANCER RES, V17, P3146, DOI 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-337; Garouniatis A, 2013, INT J COLORECTAL DIS, V28, P9, DOI 10.1007/s00384-012-1520-; Gusenbauer S, 2013, ONCOGENE, V32, P3846, DOI 10.1038/onc.2012.39; Ho-Yen CM, 2015, BREAST CANCER RES, V17, DOI 10.1186/s13058-015-0547-; Jemal A, 2011, CA-CANCER J CLIN, V61, P69, DOI [10.3322/caac.20107, 10.3322/caac.20115; Jiang Tao, 2015, Zhongguo Fei Ai Za Zhi, V18, P240, DOI 10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2015.04.0; Kirzin S, 2014, PLOS ONE, V9, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.010315; Lee J, 2014, PLOS ONE, V9, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.010355; Liska D, 2011, CLIN CANCER RES, V17, P472, DOI 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-056; Liu Y, 2012, TUMORI, V98, P105, DOI 10.1700/1053.1150; Luraghi P, 2014, CANCER RES, V74, P1857, DOI 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-2340-; Matsumoto R, 2015, CANCER SCI, V106, P709, DOI 10.1111/cas.1266; Saigusa S, 2012, INT J ONCOL, V40, P583, DOI 10.3892/ijo.2011.120; Salgia R, 2009, SEMIN ONCOL, V36, pS52, DOI 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2009.02.00; Sun YL, 2013, INT J MED SCI, V10, P548, DOI 10.7150/ijms.519; Sun Yanlai, 2014, Zhonghua Wei Chang Wai Ke Za Zhi, V17, P59; Takeuchi H, 2003, CLIN CANCER RES, V9, P148; Toiyama Y, 2009, INT J CANCER, V125, P1657, DOI 10.1002/ijc.2455; Yonesaka K, 2015, ANTICANCER RES, V35, P168; Zaanan A, 2014, B CANCER, V101, P25, DOI 10.1684/bdc.2013.187; Zaytseva YY, 2012, CANCER RES, V72, P1504, DOI 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-405",26,1,1,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,179.0,187,,,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700028,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0026859504132231405,7.378997206715216e-15,0.02150850140758001,0.08718757036703445,0.02150850140758001

Macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha [MIP-1 alpha/CC-chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3)] is a small chemotactic protein detected in several kinds of tumor tissue samples and functions as a key regulator of cancer progression. This study aimed to investigate the serum MIP-1 alpha/CCL3 levels in pacreatic adenocarcinoma (PA). Materials and methods: Thirty-three patients with PA were investigated. Serum MIP1-alpha/CCL3 levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Age and sex matched 30 healthy controls were included in the analysis. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 59 years, range 32-84 years; 20 (61%) patients were men. The tumor was located in the head of the pancreas in 21 (63%) patients. The most common metastatic site was the liver in the 23 patients with metastasis (n= 19, 83%). The median follow-up time was 26.0 weeks (range: 1.0-184.0 weeks). At the end of the observation period, thirty-two patients (97%) were dead. Thirty-nine percent of 23 metastatic patients who received palliative chemotherapy (CTx) were CTx-responsive. The median overall survival of all the patients was 41.3 +/- 8.3 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI]= 5-58 weeks). The baseline serum MIP1-alpha/CCL3 levels were significantly higher in patients with PA than in the control group (p< 0.001). Serum MIP1-alpha/CCL3 levels were significantly higher in the older patients(p= 0.03). Conversely, serum MIP1-alpha/CCL3 concentration had no prognostic role on survival (p= 0.68). Conclusion: Serum levels of MIP1-alpha/CCL3 may have a good diagnostic role in PA. However, serum MIP1-alpha/CCL3 concentrations were not associated with prognosis and survival.","[Karabulut, Senem; Tas, Faruk] Istanbul Univ, Inst Oncol, Dept Med Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Afsar, Cigdem Usul] Istanbul Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Kasap Ilyas Mah Org Abdurrahman Nafiz Gurman Cd, TR-34098 Istanbul, Turkey; [Karabulut, Mehmet; Alis, Halil; Binboga, Sinan] Istanbul Bakirkoy Dr Sadi Konuk Educ & Res Hosp, Clin Gen Surg, Istanbul, Turkey; [Bilgin, Elif] Istanbul Univ, Inst Oncol, Dept Basic Oncol, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ozkara, Irem Oner] Medicana Int Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Istanbul, Turkey; [Karaca, Feryal] Adana Numune Training & Res Hosp, Dept Radiat Oncol, Adana, Turkey","Afsar, CU (corresponding author), Istanbul Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Kasap Ilyas Mah Org Abdurrahman Nafiz Gurman Cd, TR-34098 Istanbul, Turkey.",,"karabulut, senem/AAT-3594-2020; Alis, Halil/AAJ-6721-2020; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/AAA-6103-2021; Tas, Faruk/AAF-8751-2019; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/C-3436-2015; Doğru, Elif Bilgin/A-6543-2018","Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639; Afsar, Cigdem Usul/0000-0002-3764-7639; Doğru, Elif Bilgin/0000-0003-0077-7939",,,"Falcao JOA, 2013, TUMORI, V99, P540, DOI 10.1700/1361.1510; Baba T, 2013, J EXP MED, V210, P2661, DOI 10.1084/jem.2013011; Baschuk N, 2014, CELL DEATH DIS, V5, DOI 10.1038/cddis.2014.7; Ben-Baruch A, 2006, SEMIN CANCER BIOL, V16, P38, DOI 10.1016/j.semcancer.2005.07.00; Bodelon C, 2013, INT J MOL EPIDEMIOL, V4, P21; BOYLE P, 1989, INT J PANCREATOL, V5, P327, DOI 10.1007/BF0292429; Cao Q, 2010, CANCER LETT, V295, P17, DOI 10.1016/j.canlet.2010.02.00; Deshmane SL, 2009, J INTERF CYTOK RES, V29, P313, DOI 10.1089/jir.2008.002; Ding L, 2014, TUMOR BIOL, V35, P10539, DOI 10.1007/s13277-014-2306-; Drake CG, 2012, ANN ONCOL, V23, P41, DOI 10.1093/annonc/mds26; Farrow B, 2002, SURG ONCOL, V10, P153, DOI 10.1016/S0960-7404(02)00015-; Hariharan D, 2008, HPB, V10, P58, DOI 10.1080/1365182070188314; Hsu CJ, 2013, CELL COMMUN SIGNAL, V11, DOI 10.1186/1478-811X-11-6; Jemal A, 2011, CA-CANCER J CLIN, V61, P69, DOI [10.3322/caac.20107, 10.3322/caac.20115; Jeong KY, 2015, J RADIAT RES, V56, P37, DOI 10.1093/jrr/rru07; Li Y, 2015, ONCOTARGET, V6, P24218, DOI 10.18632/oncotarget.452; Lunardi S, 2014, CANCER LETT, V343, P147, DOI 10.1016/j.canlet.2013.09.03; Ma JM, 2013, JNCI-J NATL CANCER I, V105, P1694, DOI 10.1093/jnci/djt29; McCawley LJ, 2001, CURR BIOL, V11, pR25, DOI 10.1016/S0960-9822(00)00038-; Pandol S, 2009, CLIN GASTROENTEROL H, V7, pS44, DOI 10.1016/j.cgh.2009.07.03; Paniccia A, 2015, CHINESE J CANCER RES, V27, P376, DOI 10.3978/j.issn.1000-9604.2015.05.0; Shiraishi K, 2008, CLIN CANCER RES, V14, P1159, DOI 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-448; Takai E, 2015, WORLD J GASTRO ONCOL, V7, P250, DOI 10.4251/wjgo.v7.i10.25; Tao LL, 2014, WORLD J GASTROENTERO, V20, P4421, DOI 10.3748/wjg.v20.i15.442; Tonouchi H, 2002, SCAND J GASTROENTERO, V37, P830, DOI 10.1080/71378653; Tsirakis G, 2014, MED ONCOL, V31, DOI 10.1007/s12032-013-0778-; Wang XT, 2014, LEUKEMIA RES, V38, P525, DOI 10.1016/j.leukres.2014.02.01; Wu HH, 2015, J EXP MED, V212, P333, DOI 10.1084/jem.2014170; Wu JH, 2013, BMC CLIN PATHOL, V13, DOI 10.1186/1472-6890-13-1; Zhang JJ, 2008, EUR J CANCER PREV, V17, P18, DOI 10.1097/CEJ.0b013e32809b4cc; Zhang Y, 2015, REV RECENT CLIN TRIA, V10, P317, DOI 10.2174/157488711066615091614253",31,1,1,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,4.0,,,,,1035.0,1040,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_128,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DY1XF,WOS:000384887000028,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003202479338842975,7.43032890918585e-15,0.009704753474976497,0.08712165531145091,0.010536981955481707

Method: Pubmed, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were interrogated. Results: A total of 23 cases with coexistence of Behcet's disease and ankylosing spondylitis were found and afterwards reviewed. The majority of them involved male subjects (82.6%). All patients had mucocutaneous lesions and sacroiliitis, 54.5% of all patients had eye involvement, 68.4% had positive pathergy test, 75% had peripheral arthritis and 55.6% of patients developed ankylosing spondylitis after Behcet's disease. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors were used in six cases. HLA-B51 was positive in 57.1% and HLA-B27 in 59.1% of all cases. Conclusion: Even though Behcet's disease has some clinical and genetic features in common with spondyloarthritis, there remains no sufficient evidence that phenotypes of these shared features are identical or these features are traced to a similar pathogenesis. By taking into account all previously reported cases and our presented case, we suggest that ankylosing spondylitis should be considered in differential diagnosis as a coexisting condition when a Behcet's disease patient with low back pain is being examined.","[Kardes, Sinan; Karagulle, Mine; Karagulle, Mufit Zeki; Erdogan, Nergis] Istanbul Univ, Dept Med Ecol & Hydroclimatol, Istanbul Fac Med, Istanbul, Turkey","Kardes, S (corresponding author), Istanbul Tip Fak Fatih Cap, Tibbi Ekol & Hidroklimatol ABD, TR-34093 Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Karagülle, Müfit Zeki/AAD-6090-2020; Erdogan, Nergis/A-9030-2016; Kardes, Sinan/L-6731-2015; Karagülle, Mine/J-4418-2016","Erdogan, Nergis/0000-0001-9674-8547; Kardes, Sinan/0000-0002-6311-8634; Karagülle, Mine/0000-0002-8060-970X",,,"Badi MAA, 2008, REV MED INTERNE, V29, P277, DOI 10.1016/j.revmed.2007.09.03; Benamour S, 1998, REV RHUM, V65, P29; Borman P, 2000, RHEUMATOL INT, V19, P195, DOI 10.1007/s00296000005; Braun J, 2007, LANCET, V369, P1379, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60635-; Celik C, 2011, TURK J RHEUMATOL, V26, P271, DOI 10.5606/tjr.2011.04; CHAMBERLAIN MA, 1993, BRIT J RHEUMATOL, V32, P69; Chang HK, 2002, J KOREAN MED SCI, V17, P524, DOI 10.3346/jkms.2002.17.4.52; Chang Hyun Kyu, 2000, Korean Journal of Internal Medicine, V15, P9; Chung SH, 2013, WORLD J GASTROENTERO, V19, P5389, DOI 10.3748/wjg.v19.i32.538; Cimen OB, 2002, Z RHEUMATOL, V61, P440, DOI 10.1007/s00393-002-0319-; Davatchi F, 2014, J EUR ACAD DERMATOL, V28, P338, DOI 10.1111/jdv.1210; Dilsen N, 1986, RECENT ADV BEHCETS D, V103, P28; El Maghraoui A, 2001, CLIN RHEUMATOL, V20, P189, DOI 10.1007/s10067017006; Eser F, 2008, ROMATIZMA, V23, P6; Etaouil N, 2002, JOINT BONE SPINE, V69, P96, DOI 10.1016/S1297-319X(01)00353-; Fatemi A, 2017, INT J RHEUM DIS, V20, P97, DOI 10.1111/1756-185X.1263; Hatemi I, 2008, CLIN EXP RHEUMATOL, V26, pS9; Kirino Y, 2013, NAT GENET, V45, P202, DOI 10.1038/ng.252; Kocyigit H, 2010, TURK J RHEUMATOL, V25, P217, DOI 10.5152/tjr.2010.3; Kotevoglu N, 2004, JCR-J CLIN RHEUMATOL, V10, P42, DOI 10.1097/01.rhu.0000111298.67743.0; Kotevoglu N, 2003, SCAND J RHEUMATOL, V32, P184, DOI 10.1080/0300974031000255; Kucuksen S, 2013, EUR J GEN MED, V10, P11; Lee SK, 2009, ENDOSCOPY, V41, P9, DOI 10.1055/s-0028-110348; McGonagle D, 2015, NAT REV RHEUMATOL, V11, P731, DOI 10.1038/nrrheum.2015.14; MOLL JMH, 1974, MEDICINE, V53, P343, DOI 10.1097/00005792-197409000-0000; Nacir B, 2013, J PMR SCI, V16, P2; OLIVIERI I, 1988, ANN RHEUM DIS, V47, P780, DOI 10.1136/ard.47.9.78; OLIVIERI I, 1990, BRIT J RHEUMATOL, V29, P26; Ordahan B, 2014, J RHEUMATOL ORTHOP, V1, P2, DOI 10.7243/2055-7000-1-; Ozsahin M, 2012, TURK J RHEUMATOL, V27, P214, DOI 10.5606/tjr.2012.03; Smith EL, CLIN MANIFESTATION; Terzi R, 2012, MED J KOCAELI, V1, P2; VANDERLINDEN S, 1984, ARTHRITIS RHEUM, V27, P36; YAZICI H, 1981, ANN RHEUM DIS, V40, P558, DOI 10.1136/ard.40.6.55; Yazici H, 2012, CLIN REV ALLERG IMMU, V43, P275, DOI 10.1007/s12016-012-8319-; YAZICI H, 1987, ANN RHEUM DIS, V46, P139, DOI 10.1136/ard.46.2.13; Yildiz N, 2010, RHEUMATOL INT, V30, P1511, DOI 10.1007/s00296-009-1104-; Yoo WH, 2012, RHEUMATOL INT, V32, P1793, DOI 10.1007/s00296-010-1439-",38,2,3,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,4.0,,,,,947.0,951,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_114,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DY1XF,WOS:000384887000014,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003925619834710744,1.7320115509027565e-20,0.007630411412967837,0.07241010450094627,0.007630411412967837

Although the reliable and valid Dissociative Experience Scale (DES) as the gold-standard instrument to quantify the frequency of self-reported dissociative experiences, and as much the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI; as a self-report measure-validated in several languages) are useful for identifying adults at risk of developing acute and chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), they have not been validated in Iran and their predictive values remain unknown in this population. Objective: To assess the reliability and validity of the Persian version of Dissociative Experience Scale (DES) and the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI). Method: We included 43 male survivors of fatal motor vehicle accidents. The participants were assessed by PDI and DES, and were retested by DES, and assessed by Mississippi Scale for PTSD in three intervals of immediately after, one month and three months after the event. Results: The DES was significantly correlated with PTSD. Reliability analysis revealed a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.87. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient for test-retest analysis was 0.87. The PDI was not significantly correlated with PTSD and was borderline and not significantly correlated with DES. Reliability analysis revealed a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.73. Conclusion: Our results suggest that Persian versions of PDI and DES showed a desirable psychometric applicability, except for predictive criterion validity for PDI. In regard to predictive validity, DES but not PDI, might be good instruments to use as a reliable screening tool for future PTSD at least in the initial week after MVA.","[Kianpoor, Mohsen] Zahedan Univ Med Sci, Zahedan Med Sch, Psychiat, Zahedan, Iran; [Amouchie, Ramin; Mazidi, Mahdi; Abasian, Mahboobe; Saffarian, Zahra] Univ Social Welf & Rehabil Sci, Sch Behav Sci, Dept Clin Psychol, Clin Psychol, Tehran, Iran; [Raghibi, Mahvash] Univ Sistan & Baluchestan, Fac Educ Psychol, Psychol, Univ St, Zahedan, Iran; [Hesam, Saeed] ACECR, Royan Inst Reprod Biomed, Dept Epidemiol, Biostatist, Tehran, Iran; [Hesam, Saeed] ACECR, Royan Inst Reprod Biomed, Reprod Epidemiol Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Masoumi, Sarah] Shiraz Univ, Dept Educ Psychol, Shiraz, Iran; [Sadeghkhani, Ali] Univ Allameh Tabatabaei, Fac Psychol, Gen Psychol, Tehran, Iran","Amouchie, R (corresponding author), Univ Social Welf & Rehabil Sci, Sch Behav Sci, Dept Clin Psychol, Clin Psychol, Tehran, Iran.",ramin_amouchie@yahoo.com,"hesam, saeed/AAG-3289-2019","Mazidi Sharafabadi, Mahdi/0000-0002-0039-8229",,,"Abedi G., 2014, J MAZANDARAN U MED S, V24, P18; Abedi G, 2012, INT J COLLAB RES INT, V4, P10; Agorastos A, 2013, BMC PSYCHIATRY, V13, DOI 10.1186/1471-244X-13-; Al-Balbissi Adli H, 2003, Traffic Inj Prev, V4, P64, DOI 10.1080/1538958030985; Allenou C, 2010, DEPRESS ANXIETY, V27, P652, DOI 10.1002/da.2065; Apfel BA, 2011, J PSYCHIATR RES, V45, P735, DOI 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.11.01; Armour C, 2014, J ANXIETY DISORD, V28, P418, DOI 10.1016/j.janxdis.2013.12.00; Berger W, 2012, SOC PSYCH PSYCH EPID, V47, P1001, DOI 10.1007/s00127-011-0408-; Brunet A, 2001, AM J PSYCHIAT, V158, P1480, DOI 10.1176/appi.ajp.158.9.148; Bryant RA, 2001, HYPNOTIZABILITY ACU; Bryant RA, 2011, DISSOCIATION AND THE DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS: DSM-V AND BEYOND, P18; Bryant RA, 2011, BEHAV RES THER, V49, P346, DOI 10.1016/j.brat.2011.03.00; Carlson E.B., 1993, DISSOCIATION PROGR ; Chan AOM, 2003, J CLIN PSYCHIAT, V64, P175, DOI 10.4088/JCP.v64n021; Creamer M, 2004, BEHAV RES THER, V42, P315, DOI 10.1016/S0005-7967(03)00141-; Ehlers A, 2000, BEHAV RES THER, V38, P319, DOI 10.1016/S0005-7967(99)00123-; Fiszman Adriana, 2004, Rev.

Together with biochemical and serological diagnostic methods and a histopathological assessment is important to detect necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in the liver. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values are tests often used to predict the histological stages of chronic hepatitis. Materials and methods: One hundred seventy-three patients who were referred to the Kahramanmaras Necip Fazil City Hospital Microbiology Laboratory with prediagnosis of HBV infection between September 2012-January 2016, were evaluated with necroinflammatory activity levels/ histological activity index (HAI) and fibrosis scores according to the ISHAK classification criteria, and the results were compared with alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and HBV-DNA serum levels of the time of biopsy. Results: The study included 63 female and 109 male patients. The mean age was 39.39 +/- 13.4 years. There was statistically significant difference in age, ALT, AST, and HBV DNA levels between patients in the high fibrosis group and the low fibrosis group (p: 0.034, 0.002, 0.0001, and 0.007, respectively). There was significant difference between patients from severe HAI and mild to moderate HAI groups in terms of AST values (p: 0.045). AST was found to be a risk factor for fibrosis, and ALT and AST were found to be risk factors for HAI. HBV DNA, ALT, and AST levels of HBe-Ag positive patients were significantly higher compared to HBe-Ag negative patients (p: 0,0001, 0,027, 0,008). Conclusions: In our study, advanced age, high HBV DNA, ALT and AST levels were found to be associated with fibrosis, and high AST levels were found to be associated with liver necroinflammation. It is thought that serum ALT and AST levels could be useful parameters for liver necroinflammation and fibrosis. Evaluation of these parameters in chronic hepatitis B patients as indicator parameters for advanced stages of fibrosis and necroinflammation would be a right approach.","[Kirisci, Ozlem; Caliskan, Ahmet; Tumer, Seray] Necip Fazil City Hosp, Dept Med Microbiol, Kahramanmaras, Turkey; [Paksoy, Tugba; Analan, Asiye; Kirmaci, Beyhan; Citil, Rana; Agirbas, Sule; Guzel, Zeki] Necip Fazil City Hosp, Dept Med Pathol, Kahramanmaras, Turkey; [Ozkaya, Esra] Karadeniz Tech Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Trabzon, Turkey; [Cikim, Gurkan] Necip Fazil City Hosp, Dept Med Biochem, Kahramanmaras, Turkey; [Senol, Hande] Pamukkale Univ, Fac Med, Dept Biostat, Denizli, Turkey","Kirisci, O (corresponding author), Necip Fazil City Hosp, Dept Med Microbiol, Kahramanmaras, Turkey.",,,"Ozkaya, Esra/0000-0003-1673-9101",,,"Aygun C., 2010, Firat Tip Dergisi, V15, P7; CHISARI FV, 1995, ANNU REV IMMUNOL, V13, P29, DOI 10.1146/annurev.immunol.13.1.2; CHU CM, 1993, CLIN INFECT DIS, V16, P709, DOI 10.1093/clind/16.5.70; Demir NA, 2014, HEPAT MON, V14, DOI 10.5812/hepatmon.1697; Inci A, 2015, VIRAL HEPAT DERG, V21, P52, DOI 10.4274/vhd.9870; ISHAK K, 1995, J HEPATOL, V22, P696, DOI 10.1016/0168-8278(95)80226-; Kaya S, 2006, INONU U TIP FAK DERG, V13, P2; KNODELL RG, 1981, HEPATOLOGY, V1, P431, DOI 10.1002/hep.184001051; Kose S, VIRAL HEPATIT DERGIS, V17, P5; LJUNGGREN KK, 1993, J MED VIROL, V39, P297, DOI 10.1002/jmv.189039040; Lok AS, 2001, GASTROENTEROLOGY, V120, P1828, DOI 10.1053/gast.2001.2483; MCGILL DB, 1990, GASTROENTEROLOGY, V99, P1396, DOI 10.1016/0016-5085(90)91167-; Mohamadnejad M, 2006, AM J GASTROENTEROL, V101, P2537, DOI 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2006.00788.; Ortatatli M, 2014, J CLIN ANAL MED, V5, P494, DOI 10.4328/JCAM.153; Ozbilge H, 2005, ERCIYES MED J, V27, P1; Ozkara S, 2011, TURK KLIN TIP BILIM, V31, P68, DOI 10.5336/medsci.2009-1651; Sakugawa H, 2001, HEPATOL RES, V21, P159, DOI 10.1016/S1386-6346(01)00085-; Solter PF, 2005, TOXICOL PATHOL, V33, P9, DOI 10.1080/0192623059052208; TASYARAN MA, 2003, VIRAL HEPATIT 2003, P12; ter Borg F, 1998, LANCET, V351, P1914, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)09391-; Thapa BR, 2007, INDIAN J PEDIATR, V74, P663, DOI 10.1007/s12098-007-0118-; Tsai JF, 2000, J GASTROENTEROL, V35, P690, DOI 10.1007/s00535007004; Ustundag Y, 2000, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V15, P1716, DOI 10.1093/ndt/15.10.171; Yalcin K, 2003, T KLIN GASTROENTEROH, V14, P15; Zavaglia C, 1997, LIVER, V17, P8; Zechini B, 2004, EUR J GASTROEN HEPAT, V16, P891, DOI 10.1097/00042737-200409000-0001",26,2,2,0,9,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1805.0,1811,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_167,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300011,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0026859504132231405,7.538925236848294e-15,0.005158885343493069,0.08587117549477942,0.005158885343493069

There is little information available about the aftermath of earthquakes on women's reproductive health in Iran and other Middle East countries. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the status of women's reproductive health following East Azerbaijan province earthquakes of August 12, 2012 in Iran. Methods: In this qualitative study, 16 earthquake-affected women and 14 health providers from the three struck towns and their villages, and health center and deputy for healthcare of Red Crescent Society of East Azerbaijan province in Iran, participated in semi-structured interviews and data were analyzed by means of qualitative content analysis. Results: Four main categories were extracted including psychological complications, reproductive system physical damages, sexual health damages, and fertility regulation. The first category had two subcategories (short term and long term effects). Conclusion: Results showed that the earthquake had severe effects on some aspects of women's reproductive health, particularly on pregnant women and women in labor. Providing such cares, must therefore be prioritized in services for earthquake-affected women. This issue shows a demand for decision-makers' and service providers' greater attention to women needs during natural disasters.","[Kohan, Shahnaz] Isfahan Univ Med Sci, Nursing & Midwifery Care Res Ctr, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Esfahan, Iran; [Yarmohammadian, Mohammad Hossein; Haghshenas, Abbas] Isfahan Univ Med Sci, Hlth Management & Econ Res Ctr, Esfahan, Iran; [Bahmanjanbeh, Farideh] Isfahan Univ Med Sci, Res Ctr, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Esfahan, Iran; [Bahmanjanbeh, Farideh] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Midwifery, Tabriz Branch, Tabriz, Iran; [Haghshenas, Abbas] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Haghshenas, Abbas] Benchmark Med, Martin Pl, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Bahmanjanbeh, F (corresponding author), Isfahan Univ Med Sci, Res Ctr, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Esfahan, Iran.;Bahmanjanbeh, F (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Midwifery, Tabriz Branch, Tabriz, Iran.",farideh_obs@yahoo.com,"kohan, shahnaz/E-7974-2012; Yarmohammadian, Mohammad H/E-7436-2012; Yarmohammadian, Mohammad H/ABD-6806-2020","Yarmohammadian, Mohammad H/0000-0002-4711-3163; kohan, shahnaz/0000-0003-1479-2160","Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran [39634]","This article is part of the PhD dissertation in reproductive health submitted and supported financially by Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (Code 39634), Isfahan, Iran.

The objective of the study is to indicate the variations in NLR that occur in patients with major depressive disorder. Materials and methods: Forty prospective patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder based on DSM 4-TR and treated in our clinic were included in the study. The control group included forty healthy individuals that applied to our clinic, however were not diagnosed with active psychopathology in the initial examination, and have matching age and gender demographics with the patient group. Lymphocyte and neutrophil percentages taken during the application before the treatment were recorded in the related forms. NLR was calculated by the division of neutrophil rate by the lymphocyte rate for each patient. Results: There was no significant difference between the groups based on socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, income level, smoking, and employment. Mean NLR value was 1.58 +/- 0.59 in the patient group, and it was 2.05 +/- 0.89 in the control group. The difference between these mean values was statistically significant (p=0.007). In control group, the neutrophil percentage, and in patient group the lymphocyte percentage was significantly high. There was no difference between the groups on white blood cell count. Conclusion: It was determined that the NLR is significantly lower in patients with major depressive disorder when compared to the control group. The changes in NLR could reflect the changes in central nervous system metabolisms. Thus, NLR could be an indicator of the fact that immune system is suppressed in chronic inflammation in psychiatric diseases such as depressive disorder.","[Korkmaz, Sevda; Gundogan, Burcu; Korucu, Tuba; Dulkadir, Zehra Emine; Atmaca, Murad] Firat Univ, Fac Med, Dept Psychiat, TR-23169 Elazig, Turkey; [Denk, Affan] Firat Univ, Fac Med, Dept Infect, TR-23169 Elazig, Turkey; [Telo, Selda] Firat Univ, Fac Med, Dept Biochem, TR-23169 Elazig, Turkey","Korkmaz, S (corresponding author), Firat Univ, Fac Med, Dept Psychiat, TR-23169 Elazig, Turkey.",,"Atmaca, Murad/V-9377-2018; KORKMAZ, SEVDA/O-2867-2015; Telo, Selda/V-6019-2018; Telo, Selda/V-5992-2018","Telo, Selda/0000-0003-3655-0269; ",,,"American Psychiatric Association, 2000, DIAGN STAT MAN MENT, V4th, DOI [DOI 10.1176/APPI.BOOKS.9780890420249.DSM-IV-TR, 10.1176/appi.books.9780890420249.dsm-iv-tr; Azab B, 2014, CANCER BIOMARK, V14, P303, DOI 10.3233/CBM-14041; Gladkevich A, 2004, PROG NEURO-PSYCHOPH, V28, P559, DOI 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2004.01.00; Jilma B, 1999, AM J RESP CRIT CARE, V159, P857, DOI 10.1164/ajrccm.159.3.980508; Kalelioglu T, 2015, PSYCHIAT RES, V228, P925, DOI 10.1016/j.psychres.2015.05.11; Lanquillon S, 2000, NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOL, V22, P370, DOI 10.1016/S0893-133X(99)00134-; MAES M, 1995, PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINO, V20, P111, DOI 10.1016/0306-4530(94)00066-; MUSSELMAN DL, 1996, BR J PSYCHIAT S, V30, P12; Ozturk C, 2015, ANGIOLOGY, V66, P695, DOI 10.1177/000331971558629; Reichlin T, 2010, CLIN CHEM, V56, P944, DOI 10.1373/clinchem.2009.14225; Sarandol Asli, 2003, Turk Psikiyatri Derg, V14, P11; Semiz M, 2014, PSYCHIAT DANUB, V26, P22; Tuglu C, 2003, B CLIN PSYCHOPHARMAC, V13, P14; Wen Ru-Min, 2015, Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, V16, P370; Yildiz A, 2014, J CLIN EXPT INVESTIG, V5, P2; Yu XY, 2015, ARCH GERONTOL GERIAT, V61, P76, DOI 10.1016/j.archger.2015.03.01; Zahorec R, 2001, Bratisl Lek Listy, V102, P",17,4,4,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,795.0,798,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_92,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400021,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001756198347107438,5.864688231189828e-11,0.049553879205544105,0.11471233039047224,0.05334125407163409

Typically, the signs of hepatotoxicity appear 24-36 hours after ingestion. The lactate clearance naturally decreases in impaired hepatic fraction. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of lactate and lactate clearance on the prognosis and the efficacy of therapy in patients with mushroom poisoning hospitalized in the Toxicology Unit. Materials and methods: This retrospective study included 236 patients who had been diagnosed with mushroom poisoning upon referral to the Emergency Unit, hospitalized, and treated between July 2008 and March 2013. The patients were divided into two groups as those undergone hemoperfusion and those not undergone hemoperfusion. The patients were also divided into two groups as those with abnormal liver fraction tests and those with normal liver function tests. The lactate clearance of each patient was calculated according to the values of lactate upon referral, lactate at hours 6 and 24 in the blood gas analyses. Results: The mean lactate value upon referral in patients with normal liver enzymes was 0.97 +/- 0.48 mmol/L, whereas this was 1.68 +/- 0.63 mmol/L in patients with elevated liver enzymes. The mean lactate clearance values at the 24th hour were 25.76 +/- 14.80% and 36.05 +/- 14.22%, respectively. The mean lactate clearance values at the 24th hour in patients undergoing hemoperfusion and patients not undergoing hemoperfusion were 14.26 +/- 23.52% and 39.48 +/- 14.33%, respectively. The lactate clearance at the 24th hour was significantly higher; particularly in patients with elevated liver enzymes who had received hemoperfusion along with supportive therapy (p<0.001). Conclusion: Mushroom poisoning patients with high blood lactate levels on admission to the hospital should be approached carefully with regard to requirement for hemoperfusion and the prognosis.","[Koylu, Oznur] Konya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Biochem, Konya, Turkey; [Koylu, Ramazan] Konya Training & Res Hosp, Emergency Dept, Konya, Turkey; [Dundar, Zerrin Defne] NecmettinErbakan Univ, Meram Fac Med, Dept Emergency Med, Konya, Turkey","Koylu, O (corresponding author), Konya Training & Res Hosp, Dept Biochem, Konya, Turkey.",,"Dundar, Zerrin Defne/AAR-4130-2020; Koylu, Ramazan/AGQ-8717-2022",,,,"Benaissa ML, 2003, INTENS CARE MED, V29, P1372, DOI 10.1007/s00134-003-1866-; Berger KJ, 2005, J EMERG MED, V28, P53, DOI 10.1016/j.jemermed.2004.08.01; Bernal W, 2002, LANCET, V359, P558, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07743-; Brent J, 2007, HADDAD WINCHESTERS C, P45; Bronstein AC, 2009, CLIN TOXICOL, V47, P911, DOI 10.3109/1556365090343856; Bustamante J, 1998, FREE RADICAL BIO MED, V24, P1023, DOI 10.1016/S0891-5849(97)00371-; Esen F, 2006, J SURG MED SCI, V2, P2; Goldfrank LR, 2011, GOLDFRANKS TOXICOLOG, P152; Head JM, 2012, BMJ CASE REP, V201; Levy B, 2006, CURR OPIN CRIT CARE, V12, P315, DOI 10.1097/01.ccx.0000235208.77450.1; MacQuillan GC, 2005, LIVER TRANSPLANT, V11, P1073, DOI 10.1002/lt.2042; Mendoza CD, 2006, ANN EMERG MED, V48, P637, DOI 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2006.06.04; Montanini S, 1999, ARZNEIMITTEL-FORSCH, V49, P104; Nguyen HB, 2004, CRIT CARE MED, V32, P1637, DOI 10.1097/01.CCM.0000132904.35713.A; Nilsson UA, 2008, FREE RADICAL BIO MED, V44, P1562, DOI 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.01.01; Protti A, 2012, CRIT CARE, V16, DOI 10.1186/cc1133; Roth B, 1999, ANN EMERG MED, V33, P452, DOI 10.1016/S0196-0644(99)70312-; Sargin G, 2011, TURKISH J INTENSIVE, V3, P6; Shah AD, 2011, BRIT J CLIN PHARMACO, V71, P20, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2010.03765.; Shih RD, 2014, ROSENS EMERGENCY MED, P206; SOKAL JA, 1985, ARCH TOXICOL, V57, P196, DOI 10.1007/BF0029088; Wang H, 2004, J INTERN MED, V255, P320, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2003.01302.; Zahorec R, 2001, Bratisl Lek Listy, V102, P",23,1,1,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,291.0,295,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000003,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0023760330578512395,3.6685851008720474e-14,0.004540523532671482,0.09522591561488594,0.004540523532671482

In the present study we evaluated patients diagnosed with nodular goiter according to preoperative thyroid fine needle aspiration cytology and who also underwent thyroidectomy. Materials and methods: The case reports, pathologic reports, and stained sections of 1149 patients who were admitted and underwent thyroidectomy specimens were retrospectively evaluated. Results: The cytology and histology records were correlated for 260 cases. The 1149 cases included in this study consisted of 1020 female and 129 male cases with a mean age of 41.4 years (range, 13 to 82 years). The distribution of histological findings are as follows: 999 (72.3%) cases were found to be non-neoplastic and 150 cases (13.1%) were neoplastic. Postoperative histologic evaluation demonstrated 939 (81.7%) cases of nodular hyperplasia, 70 (6.1%) cases of papillary carcinoma, 55 (4.8%) cases of follicular adenoma, 39 (3.4%) cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The correlation of cytology and histopathology showed that 145 of 260 FNA results (55.7%) were concordant, whereas 8 patients (3%) had discordant results. Eighty-five cases were excluded for being non-diagnostic. Histological review revealed incidental papillary thyroid carcinoma in 62 (5.39 %) patients. Mean tumor size was 1.26 cm. Conclusion: Nodular hyperplasia was the most common histopathological finding followed by papillary thyroid carcinoma. Improved imaging techniques combined with the correct use of fine-needle aspiration diagnoses may reduce the number of cases that are not treatable by thyroidectomy. It is likely that the early detection of some thyroid cancers is primarily incidental.","[Koyuncuer, Ali; Bayraktar, Suphi Gurman] Antakya State Hosp, Dept Pathol, Antakya, Turkey; [Gurkan, Eren] Antakya State Hosp, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, Antakya, Turkey","Koyuncuer, A (corresponding author), Antakya State Hosp, Dept Pathol, Antakya, Turkey.",,"Koyuncuer, Ali/I-7999-2014; gürkan, eren/A-8172-2019","Koyuncuer, Ali/0000-0002-0994-1275; ",,,"AGRAWAL S, 1995, J SURG ONCOL, V58, P168, DOI 10.1002/jso.293058030; Albasri A, 2014, ASIAN PAC J CANCER P, V15, P5565, DOI 10.7314/APJCP.2014.15.14.556; ALTAVILLA G, 1990, ACTA CYTOL, V34, P25; Amrikachi M, 2001, ARCH PATHOL LAB MED, V125, P48; Bahn RS, 2011, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V96, P1202, DOI 10.1210/jc.2010-258; Bakhos R, 2000, DIAGN CYTOPATHOL, V23, P233, DOI 10.1002/1097-0339(200010)23:4<233::AID-DC3>3.3.CO;2-; Baloch ZW, 1998, THYROID, V8, P565, DOI 10.1089/thy.1998.8.56; Bisi H, 1989, CANCER, V1, P188; Bombil I, 2014, S AFR J SURG, V52, DOI 10.7196/SAJS.197; Burch HB, 1996, ACTA CYTOL, V40, P117; Cappel RJDTN, 2001, CYTOPATHOLOGY, V12, P399, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2303.2001.00363.; Chukudebelu O, 2012, Ir Med J, V105, P16; Cibas ES, 2009, AM J CLIN PATHOL, V132, P658, DOI 10.1309/AJCPPHLWMI3JV4L; CORREA P, 1995, CANCER, V75, P338, DOI 10.1002/1097-0142(19950101)75:1+<338::AID-CNCR2820751316>3.0.CO;2-; Costamagna D, 2013, G CHIR, V34, P2; Cramer JD, 2010, SURGERY, V148, P1147, DOI 10.1016/j.surg.2010.10.01; Darwish AH, 2006, BAHRAIN MED B, V2; de Benoist B, 2004, IODINE STATUS WORLD; de Benoist B, 2008, FOOD NUTR BULL, V29, P195, DOI 10.1177/15648265080290030; DeLellis R.A., 2004, WHO CLASSIFICATION T, P5; Faquin WC, 2008, ARCH PATHOL LAB MED, V132, P622, DOI 10.1043/1543-2165(2008)132[622:TTGRPI]2.0.CO;; GARDINER GW, 1986, J OTOLARYNGOL, V15, P16; Hofman V, 2009, VIRCHOWS ARCH, V455, P21, DOI 10.1007/s00428-009-0798-; Hughes DT, 2011, THYROID, V21, P231, DOI 10.1089/thy.2010.013; Jin J, 2013, CURR PROB SURG, V50, P241, DOI 10.1067/j.cpsurg.2013.02.00; Ko HM, 2003, ACTA CYTOL, V47, P727, DOI 10.1159/00032659; Konturek A, 2013, LANGENBECK ARCH SURG, V398, P389, DOI 10.1007/s00423-012-1021-; Lebastchi AH, 2014, CURR PROB CANCER, V38, P48, DOI 10.1016/j.currproblcancer.2014.04.00; Lew JI, 2011, J AM COLL SURGEONS, V213, P188, DOI 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2011.04.02; Liu Q, 1998, SURGERY, V123, P2, DOI 10.1067/msy.1998.8330; Liu ZY, 2011, CANCER SCI, V102, P288, DOI 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01769.; Luo J, 2012, J SURG RES, V174, P207, DOI 10.1016/j.jss.2011.11.103; Matesa-Anic D, 2009, ACTA CLIN CROAT, V48, P; Mazokopakis EE, 2010, HORM-INT J ENDOCRINO, V9, P312, DOI 10.14310/horm.2002.128; McHenry CR, 2011, ONCOLOGIST, V16, P585, DOI 10.1634/theoncologist.2010-040; Misiakos EP, 2006, SOUTH MED J, V99, P1224, DOI 10.1097/01.smj.0000232202.82002.c; Nanjappa N, 2013, INDIAN J OTOLARYNGOL, V65, P37, DOI 10.1007/s12070-012-0596-; OTT RA, 1987, AM SURGEON, V53, P44; Pacini F, 2012, BEST PRACT RES CL EN, V26, P381, DOI 10.1016/j.beem.2011.10.00; Pagni F, 2014, ENDOCR PATHOL, V25, P288, DOI 10.1007/s12022-014-9323-; Papotti M, 2005, MODERN PATHOL, V18, P541, DOI 10.1038/modpathol.380032; Parangi S, 2010, SURGERY, V148, P115; Pezzolla A, 2014, INT J SURG, V12, pS98, DOI 10.1016/j.ijsu.2014.05.04; Rago T, 2008, BEST PRACT RES CL EN, V22, P913, DOI 10.1016/j.beem.2008.09.01; Repplinger D, 2008, J SURG RES, V150, P49, DOI 10.1016/j.jss.2007.09.02; Rosai J, 2011, ROSAI ACKERMANS SURG, P48; Rosai J, 1992, ATLAS TUMOR PATHOLO; Rossi ED, 2013, EUR J ENDOCRINOL, V169, P649, DOI 10.1530/EJE-13-043; Sclabas GM, 2003, AM J SURG, V186, P702, DOI 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2003.08.01; Seethala RR, 1996, PROTOCOL EXAMINATIO; Sidawy MK, 1997, CANCER CYTOPATHOL, V81, P253, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19970825)81:4<253::AID-CNCR7>3.0.CO;2-; Sinna EA, 2012, J EGYPT NATL CANCER, V24, P63, DOI 10.1016/j.jnci.2012.01.00; Theoharis CGA, 2009, THYROID, V19, P1215, DOI 10.1089/thy.2009.015; Tsegaye B, 2003, East Afr Med J, V80, P52; Vanderpump MPJ, 2011, BRIT MED BULL, V99, P39, DOI 10.1093/bmb/ldr03; Vashishta R, 2012, OTOLARYNG HEAD NECK, V147, P1027, DOI 10.1177/019459981245440; Yeung MJ, 2008, ONCOLOGIST, V13, P105, DOI 10.1634/theoncologist.2007-021; Ylagan LR, 2004, THYROID, V14, P35, DOI 10.1089/10507250432278382; Zhang Y, 2014, J CANCER RES CLIN, V140, P1021, DOI 10.1007/s00432-014-1629-",59,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,35.0,43,,,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700005,,,,,2022-07-14,0.006301652892561983,2.9161754308535126e-05,0.2538374713093554,0.1378073259968965,0.253749344256177

Materials and methods: In this research, 1000 patients, who have been clinically diagnosed with lung cancer, were selected into observation group, in which there were 312 patients of small cell carcinoma, 458 with adenocarcinoma, and remaining 330 with squamous carcinoma. In addition, 200 healthy people were selected as research objects in control group. Electrochemistry luminescence method was adopted to test index levels of the two groups, respectively, with test items including CYFRA21-1, NSE, CEA, CA19-9, CA125, SCC. Results: Test results showed the serum indexes of observation group were significantly higher than those of control group. In addition, through comparing 3 different types of lung cancer patients, patients with small cell carcinoma had a significantly higher concentration of serum NSE than those with squamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma; the concentrations of CA125, CEA, CA19-9 in patients with adenocarcinoma were higher than that of patients with squamous carcinoma or small cell carcinoma; the concentrations of CYFRA21-1 in patients with squamous carcinoma was the highest of the three. Moreover, it finally confirmed 958 lung cancer patients in total by testing 6 serum indexes of all selected patients, with positive rate accounting for 87.09%. Conclusion: As a result, it is of vital significance to test serum indexes such as CYFRA21-1, NSE, CEA, CA19-9, CA125, SCC for suspected lung cancer patients, and the concentrations of different indexes play key roles in confirming type of lung cancer.

The research instruments were, NEO-Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-FFI-R), Defense Mechanisms Questionnaire (DSQ-40), and Attributional Style Questionnaires (ASQ-48). Data analysis was carried out through Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Structural Equation Modeling (LISREL). The results showed that significant positive relationship among personality dimensions, i.e. extraversion, openness to experience, and conscientiousness with mature defense mechanisms, among personality dimensions, i.e. extraversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness with neurotic defense mechanisms, and among positive attribution style with mature and neurotic defense mechanisms. There was a negative significant relationship among neuroticism with mature defense mechanism and positive attribution style. Modeling and structural equation analysis proved the significant mediation of attribution styles in relationship between personality traits and defense mechanisms. According to the results of the present study, personality traits indirectly determined the type of defense mechanisms employed by the individuals through their attribution styles.","[Mohammadlou, Maryam] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Psychol, Coll Educ Sci, Zanjan, Iran; [Elahi, Tahereh; Morovati, Zekrollah] Univ Zanjan, Dept Psychol, Coll Humanities, Zanjan, Iran","Elahi, T (corresponding author), Univ Zanjan, Dept Psychol, Coll Humanities, Zanjan, Iran.",telahi@znu.ac.ir,"elahi, tahereh/Y-5273-2019; morovati, zekrollah/R-9836-2019","morovati, zekrollah/0000-0003-1216-462X",,,"azad M.

In this study, we aim to determine the importance of clinical findings and demographic data in its occurence and in understanding the prognostic importance of BD, and to establish the influencing factors of these findings. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective statistical analysis on the clinical and demographic data assessed by examining the patient charts of 703 patients with BD who were admitted to the Behcet outpatient clinic in Erciyes University Department of Dermatology between 1998-2010. Results: Seven hundred and three patients were included in this study, of which 297 (42.2%) were male, and 406 (57.8%) were female. The mean age at diagnosis of the disease was 30.1 +/- 19.1 years. Mucocutaneous findings were the most frequent and first seen findings of the disease. The most frequent finding after mucocutaneous ones was ocular involvement. It was observed that vascular involvement was more common in male patients compared to female ones. In contrast, genital ulcer, erythema nodosum and arthralgia were seen more in female patients than in males.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of aromatherapy on pain after orthopedic surgery. Methods: This study is a randomized and controlled clinical trial involving 82 patients undergoing orthopedic surgery of wrist fracture in randomly selected hospitals of Tehran in 2015. The patients of the treatment group, 8 and 16 hours after surgery, sniffed 3 drops of essential oil of lemon for 20 minutes and the intensity of pain was measured half an hour after the intervention. For the control group, routine healthcare services continued. Data was analyzed using the SPSS 21 software and descriptive and inferential statistics. Moreover, in order to measure the effects of aromatherapy and change trends, repeated measures ANOVA was used. Chi-square test was also used to determine the success rate of the treatment. Results: Comparison of changes in pain scores between the two groups showed that there is a significant relationship (p=. 049) between the intensity of pain in control and treatment groups during the examined intervals (mean of pain and anxiety reduction 8 and 16 hours after surgery). There was also a significant relationship between the recovery rates of the control and treatment groups and different intervals (p=. 008). Conclusion: The results of the study indicate a positive impact of aromatherapy with essential oils of lemon on the reduction of pain, 8 and 16 hours after orthopedic surgery. Therefore, it can be used as a non-pharmacological, inexpensive, and non-invasive care nursing-method with no complication in the orthopedic surgical sections.","[Nazari, Mahboubeh] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Nursing, Tehran Med Sci Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Kamrani, Farhad] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci & Hlth Serv, Med Surg Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Sahebalzamani, Mohammad] Islamic Azad Univ, Social Determinants Hlth Res Ctr, Tehran Med Sci Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Amin, Gholam Reza] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Fac Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, Res Ctr, Dept Pharmacognosy, Tehran, Iran","Nazari, M (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Nursing, Tehran Med Sci Branch, Tehran, Iran.",mahnazari2010@yahoo.com,"sahebalzamani, mohammad/AAO-6051-2021","sahebalzamani, mohammad/0000-0003-1730-6770",,,"Abedi Gh, INT J COLLABORATIV; Abedi G, 2012, LIFE SCI J, V9, P533; Abedi G, 2012, INT J COLLAB RES INT, V4, P10; Atrian MK, 2013, IRAN RED CRESCENT ME, V15, P848, DOI 10.5812/ircmj.1271; Bagherinesami M, 2012, MAZANDARAN U MED SCI, V22, P5; Bikmoradi A, 2015, COMPLEMENT THER MED, V23, P331, DOI 10.1016/j.ctim.2014.12.00; Buyukyilmaz FE, 2010, PAIN MANAG NURS, V11, P76, DOI 10.1016/j.pmn.2009.01.00; Dorr LD, 2007, CLIN ORTHOP RELAT R, P7, DOI 10.1097/BLO.0b013e318149296; Fayazi Sadigheh, 2011, Iran J Nurs Midwifery Res, V16, P27; Hawker GA, 2011, ARTHRIT CARE RES, V63, pS240, DOI 10.1002/acr.2054; Huang Su-Hui, 2014, OIL RELIEVING POSTAR, V201; Hur MH, 2012, J EVAL CLIN PRACT, V18, P37, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2753.2010.01521.; Ikeda H, 2014, MOL PAIN, V10, DOI 10.1186/1744-8069-10-1; Iyer, 2013, TRAUMA MANAGEMENT OR, P234, DOI [10.1007/978-1-4471-4462-5, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4471-4462-5; Jafari D, 2013, SHAFA ORTHO J, V1, P2; Jahr JS, 2013, AM J THER, V20, P189, DOI 10.1097/MJT.0b013e31828900c; Jun YS, 2013, EVID-BASED COMPL ALT, V2013, DOI 10.1155/2013/50272; Kakar S, 2015, CLIN ORTHOP RELAT R, V473, P3098, DOI 10.1007/s11999-015-4335-; Kim Jung T, 2006, Pain Pract, V6, P273, DOI 10.1111/j.1533-2500.2006.00095.; Ko YL, 2012, J CLIN NURS, V21, P689, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03818.; Lips P, 2010, OSTEOPOROSIS INT, V21, P61, DOI 10.1007/s00198-009-0946-; Lua PL, 2012, J ALTERN COMPLEM MED, V18, P534, DOI 10.1089/acm.2010.086; Mohseni M, 2012, ANESTH PAIN MED, V2, P8; Morris BJ, 2015, J AM ACAD ORTHOP SUR, V23, P267, DOI 10.5435/JAAOS-D-14-0016; Morshedi A, 2011, JMP, V4, P4; Nellans KW, 2012, HAND CLIN, V28, P113, DOI 10.1016/j.hcl.2012.02.00; Noroozinia H Heydar, 2011, TEHRAN U MED J, V69, P19; Olapour Alireza, 2013, Anesth Pain Med, V3, P203, DOI 10.5812/aapm.957; Pountos I, 2012, SCI WORLD J, DOI 10.1100/2012/60640; Sadeghifar A.R., 2014, J BABOL U MED SCI, V16, P; Sahebalzamin M, 2010, MED SCI J ISLAMIC AZ, V20, P17; Salamati A, 2014, IRAN J PHARM RES, V13, P125; Shahram Maghsoudi, 2012, LEMONTHERAPY, P15; Shauver MJ, 2011, J HAND SURG-AM, V36A, P1282, DOI 10.1016/j.jhsa.2011.05.01; Smeltzer CS, 2014, BRUNNER SUDARTH SUDA, p[231, 2364; Soleimanpour J., 2011, J KERMAN U MED SCI, V18, P4; Vakilian Katayon, 2011, Complement Ther Clin Pract, V17, P50, DOI 10.1016/j.ctcp.2010.05.00; Valipour NS, 2012, COMPLEMENT MED J FAC, V2, P; Van Son MAC, 2013, QUAL LIFE RES, V22, P2399, DOI 10.1007/s11136-013-0391-; Zamanzade Vahid, 2015, MED SURG NURSING J, V3, P20",40,4,4,1,9,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,4.0,,1513.0,1519,,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YQ,WOS:000392283200032,,,,,2022-07-14,0.004132231404958678,2.222315053732342e-14,0.008042033575287386,0.08965370330922193,0.008042033575287386

Research results suggest thatTranexamic Acid (TA) plays a major role in reducing bleeding after heart surgery. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of preoperative TA and post-CPB TA on the decrease in bleeding after heart surgery. Materials and methods: A total of 60 patients, who were candidates for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG), were randomly categorized into two groups after their written consent was obtained. First, before the surgery, TA was added to the serum of group I and normal saline was added to the serum of group II. After detachment from CPB, normal saline was injected to group I and TA was injected to group II. Postoperative bleeding was measured based on the volume of blood flowing into the chest bottle of patients and the number of blood units transfused to patients after surgery was recorded. Results: Investigation results revealed that although bleeding during surgery in the pre-pump group was higher than the post-pump group, the difference was not significant. The average volume of bleeding in the pre-pump group was higher than the post-pump group, but the difference was not statistically significant either. Moreover, pre-pump TA did not lead to a reduction in the need for transfusion during surgery. The level of bleeding in the first 2 hours after hospitalization in ICU was significant lower in the pre-pump group. However, no significant difference was observed between the duration stay of the groups in ICU. Conclusion: Pre-pump administration of TA did not result in a significant decrease in bleeding during surgery, need for transfusion, duration of stay in ICU, and duration of hospitalization as compared to post-pump TA administration.","[Negargar, Sohrab] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Anesthesiol & Crit Care, Tabriz, Iran; [Naghipour, Bahman] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Anesthesiol, Tabriz, Iran; [Anvari, Shahriar] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Cardiovasc Surg, Tabriz, Iran; [Enamzadeh, Elgar; Shiriza-Deh, Maryam] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran","Negargar, S (corresponding author), Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Anesthesiol & Crit Care, Tabriz, Iran.",negargars@yahoo.com,"anvari, shahriar/M-2997-2017; negargar, sohrab/AAD-9329-2022; naghipour, bahman/AAH-7403-2019; Enamzadeh, E/W-4893-2019","anvari, shahriar/0000-0002-4079-3530; ",,,"Abedi Gh, 2011, WORLD APPL SCI J, V12, P207; Abedi G, 2012, HEALTHMED, V6, P12; Braunwald E., 2001, HARRISONS PRINCIPLE; Casati V, 2004, J THORAC CARDIOV SUR, V128, P83, DOI 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2003.10.03; Center of diseases control and prevention (CDC), 2011, ATL HEART DIS STRO; Esfandiari Bakhtiari Rostam, 2013, Asian Cardiovasc Thorac Ann, V21, P669, DOI 10.1177/021849231246639; Karkouti K, 2006, TRANSFUSION, V46, P327, DOI 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2006.00724.; Ker K, 2012, BMJ-BRIT MED J, V344, DOI 10.1136/bmj.e305; Koster A, 2013, BRIT J ANAESTH, V110, P34, DOI 10.1093/bja/aes31; Mangano DT, 1999, CARDIAC ANESTHESI; Mehr-Aein Aflatoon, 2007, Asian Cardiovasc Thorac Ann, V15, P28; Pleym H, 2003, ANESTH ANALG, V96, P923, DOI 10.1213/01.ANE.0000054001.37346.0; Seth HJ, 2000, HEART J, V84, P39; Takagi Hisato, 2009, Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg, V9, P98, DOI 10.1510/icvts.2008.19832; Trudell Jason, 2008, AANA J, V76, P12; World Health Organization (WHO), 2011, CARD DIS CV; Zabeeda D, 2002, ANN THORAC SURG, V74, P733, DOI 10.1016/S0003-4975(02)03784-",17,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,4.0,,1231.0,1235,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YQ,WOS:000392283200007,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001756198347107438,2.3335638941969748e-11,0.0032938609495664836,0.10694832672271878,0.00329528259551526

Therefore, PE should be diagnosed in Emergency Care Units (ECU) at admission. Clinical algorithms support the clinician in this task, although performance is biased by differences in risk factors prevalent in different populations. The clinical conditions predictive of PE were evaluated in subjects from Southern Italy accessing ECU for dyspnea/chest pain. Methods: Retrospective clinical data were obtained by electronic retrieving from a hospital database. Data from 8177 patients (age 18-90 years, 54 with PE) were collected from years 2007-2013. Results: Previous history of PE, thrombosis and/or phlebitis, rheumatic diseases, respiratory failure, low blood pressure, pulse oxymetry rate (SpO(2)) and high heart rate were associated with PE diagnosis. High white blood count with neutrophilia, C reactive protein, D-dimer, NT-pro-BNP determinations, but not troponin T, were associated with PE. Recalibration of the GENEVA score and its modification, by inclusion of novel risk factors, improved the algorithm performance (GENEVA AROC=0.730, modified GENEVA AROC = 0.792, DeLong's test p = <0.001). Conclusions: PE risk factors in a large Sicilian sample are similar to those of other populations. Data from clinical history and clinical features present at admission were used to recalibrate the PE diagnostic algorithm showing that PE predictive power improved by fitting local data into the predictive model.","[Noto, Davide; Canino, Baldassare; Hopps, Eugenia; Giammanco, Antonina; Urso, Caterina; Cardella, Antonella; Averna, Maurizio R.] Univ Palermo, Dept Biomed Internal Med & Med Specialties DIBIMI, Via Vespro 129, I-90123 Palermo, Italy; [Paterno, Vincenzo; Fertitta, Emanuela] Hosp San Raffaele Giglio, Emergency Care Unit, Cefalu, Italy; [Tinaglia, Martino; Squatrito, Rosario] Hosp San Raffaele Giglio, Core Lab Unit, Cefalu, Italy; [Brocato, Francesco] Hosp San Raffaele Giglio, Engn & Informat Unit, Cefalu, Italy; [Vieni, Salvatore; Graceffa, Giuseppa] Univ Palermo, Dept Surg Oncol & Oral Sci, Palermo, Italy","Averna, MR (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Biomed Internal Med & Med Specialties DIBIMI, Via Vespro 129, I-90123 Palermo, Italy.",,"Averna, Maurizio/U-9527-2017; Noto, Davide/AAA-9208-2019; Giammanco, Antonina/AAA-8904-2019","Giammanco, Antonina/0000-0002-3088-3049; Averna, Maurizio/0000-0003-3558-9209",,,"ANDERSON FA, 1991, ARCH INTERN MED, V151, P933, DOI 10.1001/archinte.151.5.93; Becattini C, 2007, INTERN EMERG MED, V2, P119, DOI 10.1007/s11739-007-0033-; Bruinstroop E, 2009, EUR J INTERN MED, V20, P441, DOI 10.1016/j.ejim.2008.12.00; Carrier M, 2006, THROMB RES, V117, P469, DOI 10.1016/j.thromres.2005.04.00; CARSON JL, 1992, NEW ENGL J MED, V326, P1240, DOI 10.1056/NEJM19920507326190; Cavus UY, 2014, TURK J MED SCI, V44, P50, DOI 10.3906/sag-1302-4; Celik A, 2015, KAOHSIUNG J MED SCI, V31, P145, DOI 10.1016/j.kjms.2014.12.00; Choi HK, 2013, ANN RHEUM DIS, V72, P1182, DOI 10.1136/annrheumdis-2012-20166; Dalen JE, 2002, CHEST, V122, P1801, DOI 10.1378/chest.122.5.180; Goldhaber SZ, 1999, LANCET, V353, P1386, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(98)07534-; Guijarro Ricardo, 2005, Eur J Intern Med, V16, P279, DOI 10.1016/j.ejim.2005.02.00; Johannesdottir SA, 2012, J THROMB HAEMOST, V10, P815, DOI 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2012.04666.; Kayrak M, 2014, HEART LUNG CIRC, V23, P56, DOI 10.1016/j.hlc.2013.06.00; Kline JA, 2004, J THROMB HAEMOST, V2, P1247, DOI 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2004.00790.; Le Gal G, 2006, ANN INTERN MED, V144, P165, DOI 10.7326/0003-4819-144-3-200602070-0000; Pollack CV, 2011, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V57, P700, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2010.05.07; R Development Core Team, 2005, R LANG ENV STAT COM; Robin X, 2011, BMC BIOINFORMATICS, V12, DOI 10.1186/1471-2105-12-7; Stein PD, 2006, NEW ENGL J MED, V354, P2317, DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa05236; Torbicki A, 2008, EUR HEART J, V29, P2276, DOI 10.1093/eurheartj/ehn31; Vuilleumier N, 2008, THROMB RES, V121, P617, DOI 10.1016/j.thromres.2007.07.00; Wells PS, 2000, THROMB HAEMOSTASIS, V83, P41",22,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1857.0,1863,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_174,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300018,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0022727272727272726,3.2472475485697147e-17,0.04447450132731764,0.08353397019356064,0.04447450132731764

There are several studies suggesting a possible relationship between musculoskeletal pain and vitamin D deficiency. In this study, we aimed to compare serum vitamin D levels between fibromyalgia patients and control groups and investigate the relationship between vitamin D and clinical findings on patients with fibromyalgia syndrome. Materials and methods: This case control study enrolled 79 women with fibromyalgia who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria and 80 healthy women. All subjects were evaluated with vitamin D and other biochemical markers. The patients were divided into three groups based on their serum vitamin D levels (normal, insufficient, deficient). Visual analogue scale and fibromyalgia impact questionnaire were used to evaluate the patients with FMS. Results: Mean serum vitamin D levels were lower in the FMS group than in the controls (12.99 +/- 8.37 ng/ml vs.16.05 +/- 9.42 ng/ml, p=0.037). Vitamin D level was significantly negative correlated with visual analogue scale, tender point count and fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (p=0.000, r=-0.578; p=0.001, r=-0.361; p=0.000, r=-0.621). Conclusion: It was concluded that vitamin D deficiency may be related to the clinical findings in patients with FMS.","[Okyay, Ramazanazim] Ceyhan Community Hlth Ctr, Adana, Turkey; [Kocyigit, Burhanfatih; Gursoy, Savas] Gaziantep Univ, Fac Med, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Gaziantep, Turkey","Kocyigit, B (corresponding author), Gaziantep Univ, Fac Med, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Gaziantep, Turkey.",,"ravegnini, gloria/K-1330-2016; Okyay, Ramazan Azim/AAC-5703-2020; Okyay, Ramazan A./C-9299-2016; Kocyigit, Burhan Fatih/AAX-4980-2021; Gursoy, Savas/AAH-3078-2020","ravegnini, gloria/0000-0002-7774-402X; Kocyigit, Burhan Fatih/0000-0002-6065-8002; Gursoy, Savas/0000-0002-1673-9905",,,"Armstrong DJ, 2007, CLIN RHEUMATOL, V26, P551, DOI 10.1007/s10067-006-0348-; Atherton K, 2009, ANN RHEUM DIS, V68, P817, DOI 10.1136/ard.2008.09045; Bhatty SA, 2010, J PAK MED ASSOC, V60, P94; Binkley N, 2010, ENDOCRIN METAB CLIN, V39, P287, DOI 10.1016/j.ecl.2010.02.00; HICKEY L, 2004, CURR OPIN ENDOCRINOL, V11, P18, DOI DOI 10.1097/00060793-200402000-0000; Holick MF, 2007, NEW ENGL J MED, V357, P266, DOI 10.1056/NEJMra07055; Holick MF, 2006, J CLIN INVEST, V116, P2062, DOI 10.1172/JCI2944; Huisman AM, 2001, J RHEUMATOL, V28, P253; Olama SM, 2013, RHEUMATOL INT, V33, P185, DOI 10.1007/s00296-012-2361-; Plotnikoff GA, 2003, MAYO CLIN PROC, V78, P1463, DOI 10.4065/78.12.146; Rooks DS, 2007, CURR OPIN RHEUMATOL, V19, P11; Sarmer S, 2000, RHEUMATOL INT, V20, P9, DOI 10.1007/s00296000007; Sarzi-Puttini P, 2002, CLIN EXP RHEUMATOL, V20, P6; Shipton EE, PAIN RES TREATMENT, V201; Tandeter H, 2009, ISR MED ASSOC J, V11, P33; Thompson Mollie E, 2003, Curr Pain Headache Rep, V7, P342, DOI 10.1007/s11916-003-0032-; Ulusoy H, 2010, BRATISL MED J, V111, P60; WOLFE F, 1990, ARTHRITIS RHEUM-US, V33, P160, DOI 10.1002/art.178033020",18,13,13,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,243.0,247,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700038,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001859504132231405,1.1370521710694386e-20,0.009882688857789592,0.0721370604147881,0.009882688857789592

However, there is no data on serum ferritin levels in patients with hepatitis D virus (HDV)-related cirrhosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether there are differences in serum ferritin levels among patients with HBV-related cirrhosis, HDV-related cirrhosis and healthy subjects. Materials and methods: Thirty-one patients with HBV-related cirrhosis, 33 patients with HDV-related cirrhosis, and 51 healthy controls were included in the study. Serum iron parameters including serum iron (SI), total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and ferritin were measured in these groups. Results: The average serum ferritin levels of patients with HDV-related cirrhosis, HBV-related cirrhosis and controls were 173.7 +/- 161.3, 168.2 +/- 165.1 and 86.3 +/- 58.4; respectively. The HBV-related cirrhosis and HDV-related cirrhosis groups had higher ferritin levels than the control group. However, there were no statistically significant differences between patients with HBV-related cirrhosis and control groups and HDV-related cirrhosis and HBV-related cirrhosis (all, p>0.05). On the contrary, comparison between HDV-related cirrhosis and control group was statistically significant (p=0.004). Conclusions: HBV and HDV-related cirrhosis patients had higher ferritin levels and lower total iron binding capacity (TIBC) than healthy controls. The presence of HDV-related cirrhosis affects serum ferritin levels. Therefore, increased ferritin levels may play a role in the pathogenesis HDV-related cirrhosis.","[Olmez, Sehmus] Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol, TR-65000 Van, Turkey; [Aslan, Mehmet] Yuzuncu Yil Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Van, Turkey;

Materials and method: This study was retrospectively conducted in 776 patients admitted to intensive care unit between 01.01.2013 and 31.12.2013. Age, sex, clinical diagnosis, comorbid conditions, RDW levels at intensive care admission and discharge, duration of intensive care stay, and mortality rate were evaluated. Kolmogorov Smirnov, student t-test, Mann Whithey u test, and Chi-square test were used for data analysis. The results were provided at a confidence interval of 95% and a significance level of p<0.05. Results: Conducted on 776 patients in Ankara Numune Hospital's general intensive care clinic 3, this study revealed a mortality rate of 38.2%. The mean age of the study population was 65.4+/-18.3 years, with the deceased patients having a greater mean age (p<0.05). Four hundred and thirteen (53.2%) patients were male, and there was no significant difference between the ratios of both genders (p>0.05). The deceased patients had significantly increasing RDW levels whereas the surviving patients had significantly reducing RDW levels (p<0.05). There was a significant correlation between the magnitude of RDW increment and duration of hospital stay in the deceased patients (p<0.05). Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that RDW, with known association with mortality, can be used as a simple marker for patient follow-up and monitorization of effectiveness of the administered therapies in ICU.","[Ozdemir, Rabia] Medipol Univ Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol & Reanimat, Istanbul, Turkey; [Mutlu, Nevzat Mehmet; Ozdemir, Metin; Akcay, Murat; Turan, Isil Ozkocak] Ankara Numune Training & Res Hosp, Dept Intens Care, Ankara, Turkey; [Yel, Cihat] Antakya State Hosp, Dept Emergency, Antakya, Turkey","Ozdemir, R (corresponding author), Medipol Mega Univ Hosp, Anestesiol & Reanimat Dept, Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Mutlu, Mehmet Nevzat/AIB-3959-2022; TURAN, ISIL OZKOCAK/B-6466-2017",,,,"Akpir K, 2002, YOGUN BAKIN SERUVENI, V1, P; Altun Y, 2011, RELATIONSHIP MEAN PL, V2, P40; Anderson JL, 2007, AM J CARDIOL, V99, P169, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2006.08.01; Ayazoglu TA, 2012, YENI TIP DERGISI, V29, P10; Bekler A, 2014, MED SCI MONITOR, V20, P413, DOI 10.12659/MSM.89015; Braun E, 2014, BMC INFECT DIS, V14, DOI 10.1186/1471-2334-14-12; BUENOCAVANILLAS A, 1994, CRIT CARE MED, V22, P55, DOI 10.1097/00003246-199401000-0001; CEYLAN E, 2001, TURKISH THORACIC J, V2, P; Fujita B, 2015, CLIN BIOCHEM, V48, P1048, DOI 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2015.07.01; Fukuta H, 2009, INT HEART J, V50, P301, DOI 10.1536/ihj.50.30; Goldhill DR, 1998, CRIT CARE MED, V26, P1337, DOI 10.1097/00003246-199808000-0001; Hunziker S, 2012, CRIT CARE, V16, DOI 10.1186/cc1135; Isik B, 2016, J PAK MED ASSOC, V66, P15; Isik T, 2012, CORONARY ARTERY DIS, V23, P51, DOI 10.1097/MCA.0b013e32834e4f5; Jo YH, 2013, AM J EMERG MED, V31, P545, DOI 10.1016/j.ajem.2012.10.01; Kim CH, 2013, CRIT CARE, V17, DOI 10.1186/cc1314; Ku NS, 2012, SHOCK, V38, P123, DOI 10.1097/SHK.0b013e31825e2a8; Lee JH, 2013, AM J EMERG MED, V31, P72, DOI 10.1016/j.ajem.2012.06.00; Lippi G, 2009, ARCH PATHOL LAB MED, V133, P628, DOI 10.1043/1543-2165-133.4.62; Majercik S, 2013, J TRAUMA ACUTE CARE, V74, P1021, DOI 10.1097/TA.0b013e3182826f0; Marinkovic D, 2007, J CLIN INVEST, V117, P2133, DOI 10.1172/JCI3180; Montagnana M, 2012, CLIN CHEM LAB MED, V50, P635, DOI [10.1515/cclm.2011.831, 10.1515/CCLM.2011.831; Ozay HY, 2012, J TURK SOC INTENSI, V10, P91, DOI 10.4274/Tybdd.3007; Ozdogan HK, 2015, ULUS TRAVMA ACIL CER, V21, P352, DOI 10.5505/tjtes.2015.2673; Patel KV, 2010, J GERONTOL A-BIOL, V65, P258, DOI 10.1093/gerona/glp16; Patel KV, 2009, ARCH INTERN MED, V169, P515, DOI 10.1001/archinternmed.2009.1; Perlstein TS, 2009, ARCH INTERN MED, V169, P588, DOI 10.1001/archinternmed.2009.5; Sadaka Farid, 2013, J Intensive Care Med, V28, P307, DOI 10.1177/088506661245283; SPENCER RC, 1994, INTENS CARE MED, V20, pS2, DOI 10.1007/BF0171397; Uysal N, 2010, J MED SURG INTENSIVE, V1, P; Vashistha T, 2016, AM J KIDNEY DI; Wang FL, 2011, ANN MED, V43, P40, DOI 10.3109/07853890.2010.52176; Wonnerth A, 2016, EUR J CLIN INVEST, V46, P198, DOI 10.1111/eci.1258; Zhang ZH, 2013, J THORAC DIS, V5, P730, DOI 10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2013.11.1",34,2,2,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,349.0,354,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000012,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003512396694214876,8.52329113202381e-14,0.005742853477580984,0.09036172695449242,0.005740711099281325

Resistance of these bacteria against to antibiotics, in particular is emerging as a very significant in intensive care units. The factors which affect the increase in resistance to antimicrobial drugs are the high probability of encountering antimicrobial resistant microorganisms and empiric antimicrobial treatment. Materials and methods: The bacterial culture results of clinical specimens sent to Microbiology Laboratory of Mustafa Kemal University Hospital in five year period were examined retrospectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacteria of genus Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from these specimens were analyzed. The antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter strains isolated from ICUs and those isolated from other clinics was compared. Results: In five-year period, 772 P. aeruginosa and 971 Acinetobacter spp. were isolated from the specimens. Twenty-three percent of P. aeruginosa strains and 49.3% of Acinetobacter spp. were isolated from the patients in intensive care units. 628 (64.7%) of Acinetobacter and 92 (11.9%) of P. aeruginosa strains were found to be Multidrug Resistant (MDR). The ratios of multidrug-resistance in Acinetobacter strains isolated from the patients in ICUs were found to be higher than those in P. aeruginosa strains isolated from the patients in intensive care units. MDR ratio of these bacteria isolated in ICUs was higher than that isolated in the other clinics. Conclusion: Acinetobacter strains isolated from the patients in ICUs were determined to be more resistant than those isolated from the patients in other clinics while Pseudomonas strains isolated from the other clinics, were more resistant than those isolated from the patients hospitalized in ICUs. The ratio of MDR bacteria was higher in ICUs than that in other clinics.","[Ozer, Burcin; Inci, Melek; Duran, Nizami; Kurtgoz, Seyda; Alagoz, Gulcan; Pasa, Ozgur; Kilinc, Cetin] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Antakya, Turkey","Ozer, B (corresponding author), Mustafa Kemal Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Microbiol, Tayfur Sokmen Campus, TR-31034 Alahan Hatay, Turkey.",,,,,,"Cortes JA, 2013, BRAZ J INFECT DIS, V17, P346, DOI 10.1016/j.bjid.2012.10.02; [Anonymous], 2014, J INFECTION, V68, P13; Brusselaers N, 2011, ANN INTENSIVE CARE, V1, DOI 10.1186/2110-5820-1-4; Chen Minjun, 2005, DIAGN MICROBIOL INFE, V51, P20; Clark Nina M, 2003, Curr Opin Crit Care, V9, P413, DOI 10.1097/00075198-200310000-0001; Henry DA, 2011, MANUAL CLIN MICROBIO, V10th, P67; Inan A, 2012, JPN J INFECT DIS, V65, P14; Landman D, 2002, ARCH INTERN MED, V162, P1515, DOI 10.1001/archinte.162.13.151; Luna CM, 2014, CRIT CARE RES PRACT, V2014, DOI 10.1155/2014/48046; Gago MM, 2013, MEDICC REV, V15, P26, DOI 10.37757/MR2013V15.N2.; Oncul O, 2014, BURNS, V40, P835, DOI 10.1016/j.burns.2013.11.00; Ozer B, 2012, J ANTIBIOT, V65, P9, DOI 10.1038/ja.2011.10; Paterson DL, 2006, CLIN INFECT DIS, V43, pS43, DOI 10.1086/50447; Potron A, 2015, INT J ANTIMICROB AG, V45, P568, DOI 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2015.03.00; Resende MM, 2013, BMC INFECT DIS, P1; Sader HS, 2014, DIAGN MICR INFEC DIS, V78, P443, DOI 10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2013.11.02; Sharma SK, 2013, INDIAN J CRIT CARE M, V17, P87, DOI 10.4103/0972-5229.11482; Tognim MCB, 2004, INT J INFECT DIS, V8, P284, DOI 10.1016/j.ijid.2003.11.00; Vaneechoutte M, 2011, MANUAL CLIN MICROBIO, V1, P71; Vila J, 2007, J ANTIMICROB CHEMOTH, V59, P1210, DOI 10.1093/jac/dkl50; Xu JC, 2012, PROCEDIA ENVIRON SCI, V12, P1375, DOI 10.1016/j.proenv.2012.01.43; Yali G, 2014, BURNS, V40, P",22,0,1,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,117.0,122,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700018,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0022727272727272726,1.7135457004389818e-20,0.004334360236312917,0.07436257902944543,0.004334360236312917

There has been growing evidence that the Mediterranean diet plays a role in medical nutrition therapy. This study aimed to determine the effects of the Mediterranean diet on the estimated 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetics. Materials and methods: This trial is an open, nonrandomized clinical trial. Participants consumed a Mediterranean diet for 12 weeks. The cardiovascular disease risk score of each individual was calculated before and after the dietary intervention, without any change in his or her medical treatments throughout the study. Results: A total of 254 patients were screened. Thirty-two patients were excluded from the study before and 20 patients after the dietary intervention. Therefore, 202 patients completed the study. We obtained a significant reduction in cardiovascular disease risk score of 245 +/- 3.6% in men and 20.0 +/- 3.5% in women (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates the efficacy of the Mediterranean diet for reducing cardiovascular diseases risk in type 2 diabetics in 12 weeks.","[Ozkaya, Ismail] Kirklareli Univ, Hlth Sch, Dept Nutr & Dietet, Kirklareli, Turkey; [Bicer, Emine Kir] Beykent Univ, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Nursing, Istanbul, Turkey; [Yardimci, Bulent] Istanbul Florence Nightingale Hosp, Div Internal Med, Dept Internal Med, Istanbul, Turkey; [Tunckale, Aydin] Istanbul Bilim Univ, Div Gen Internal Med, Dept Internal Med, Istanbul, Turkey","Ozkaya, I (corresponding author), Kirklareli Univ, Hlth Sch, Dept Nutr & Dietet, Kirklareli, Turkey.",,"BICER, Emine KIR/ABG-7528-2020","BICER, Emine KIR/0000-0002-4773-9393",,,"Ajala O, 2013, AM J CLIN NUTR, V97, P505, DOI 10.3945/ajcn.112.04245; [Anonymous], 1988, J CLIN EPIDEMIOL, V41, P105, DOI 10.1016/0895-4356(88)90084-; [Anonymous], 1999, CIRCULATION, V100, P1132, DOI DOI 10.1161/01.CIR.100.10.113; Assmann G, 1997, EUR J CANCER PREV, V6, P418, DOI 10.1097/00008469-199710000-0000; Barzi F, 2003, EUR J CLIN NUTR, V57, P604, DOI 10.1038/sj.ejcn.160157; Bedard A, 2012, BRIT J NUTR, V108, P1428, DOI 10.1017/S000711451100696; Brehm BJ, 2009, DIABETES CARE, V32, P215, DOI 10.2337/dc08-068; Calder PC, 2011, BRIT J NUTR, V106, pS1, DOI 10.1017/S000711451100546; Chomistek AK, 2015, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V65, P43, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2014.10.02; Chrysohoou C, 2004, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V44, P152, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2004.03.03; Domenech M, 2014, HYPERTENSION, V64, P69, DOI 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.0335; Elhayany A, 2010, DIABETES OBES METAB, V12, P204, DOI 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2009.01151.; Esposito K, 2009, DIABETIC MED, V26, P900, DOI 10.1111/j.1464-5491.2009.02798.; Esposito K, 2010, DIABETES RES CLIN PR, V89, P97, DOI 10.1016/j.diabres.2010.04.01; Esposito K, 2009, ANN INTERN MED, V151, P306, DOI 10.7326/0003-4819-151-5-200909010-0000; Estruch R, 2013, NEW ENGL J MED, V368, P1279, DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa120030; Golf DC, 2013, CIRCULATION S2, V129, P4; Huo R, 2014, EUR J CLIN NUT; Kastorini CM, 2011, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V57, P1299, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2010.09.07; KEYS A, 1986, AM J EPIDEMIOL, V124, P903, DOI 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a11448; Lopez-Legarrea P, 2014, ASIA PAC J CLIN NUTR, V23, P360, DOI 10.6133/apjcn.2014.23.3.1; Martinez-Gonzalez MA, 2008, BMJ-BRIT MED J, V336, P1348, DOI 10.1136/bmj.39561.501007.B; Martinez-Gonzalez MA, 2004, EUR J EPIDEMIOL, V19, P9, DOI 10.1023/B:EJEP.0000013351.60227.7; Mayor S, 2007, INT J CLIN PRACT, V61, P1773, DOI 10.1111/j.1742-1241.2007.01547.; Mozaffarian D, 2007, LANCET, V370, P667, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61343-; O'Keefe JH, 2008, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V51, P249, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2007.10.01; Pronk NP, 2015, ANN INTERN MED, V163, P465, DOI 10.7326/M15-102; Satman I, 2013, EUR J EPIDEMIOL, V28, P169, DOI 10.1007/s10654-013-9771-; Schwenke DC, 2005, CURR OPIN LIPIDOL, V16, P55, DOI 10.1097/00041433-200502000-0001; Shai I, 2008, NEW ENGL J MED, V359, P229, DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa070868; Soares TS, 2014, ARQ BRAS CARDIOL, V102, P374, DOI 10.5935/abc.2014002; Staimez LR, 2014, CURR ATHEROSCLER REP, V16, DOI 10.1007/s11883-014-0460-; Tobias DK, 2012, ARCH INTERN MED, V172, P1566, DOI 10.1001/archinternmed.2012.374; Wang X, 2013, DIABETES CARE, V36, P166, DOI 10.2337/dc12-070; Wheeler ML, 2012, DIABETES CARE, V35, P434, DOI 10.2337/dc11-221; WHO, 2014, WHO NONC DIS COUNT; WHO, 1995, PHYS STAT UINT AN; WILLETT WC, 1995, AM J CLIN NUTR, V61, p1402S, DOI 10.1093/ajcn/61.6.1402; World Health Organization (WHO), CARD DSEAS CONTR HI",39,1,1,1,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,255.0,261,,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700040,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0040289256198347105,1.0230288177589499e-08,0.007836233167315455,0.09774124822036209,0.007836233167315455

The prevalence of SCS is reported as between approximately 5% and 24% in patients with adrenal incidentalomas (AI). SCS has increased cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, and metabolic syndrome. Recently some studies demonstrated oxidative stress enhancement in Cushing's disease. Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) is a marker of ischemia and oxidative stress and is increased in different clinical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome. However, it has not been investigated in the patients with SCS. We aimed to evaluate serum IMA levels in the patients with SCS. Materials and methods: A total of 128 patients with AI were included in this study (17 patients with SCS and 111 patients with non-functional adenomas (NFA)). All patients were evaluated for the presence of adrenal masses using adrenal computed tomography (CT) scans. Serum IMA levels were measured by using a calorimetric method. Results: Serum IMA levels were significantly higher in SCS patients than in NFA patients (p < 0.05). Serum IMA was significantly correlated with waist circumference, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and SCS. Furthermore, regression analysis revealed that serum IMA levels are independent and positively associated only with SCS. Conclusion: We concluded that elevated serum IMA levels might be accepted as a useful marker in patients with SCS. In order to reveal the pathological role of IMA levels in patients with SCS more studies are required.","[Ozku, Faruk] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, TR-17100 Canakkale, Turkey; [Turkon, Hakan; Cakir, Dilek Ulker; Tutunculer, Funda Kirtay] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Biochem, TR-17100 Canakkale, Turkey; [Eroglu, Mustafa; Ukinc, Kubilay; Asik, Mehmet] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Med, Dept Endocrinol, TR-17100 Canakkale, Turkey; [Eroglu, Mustafa; Ukinc, Kubilay; Asik, Mehmet] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Med, Dept Metab, TR-17100 Canakkale, Turkey; [Faydaci, Umut] Near East Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, Nicosia, Cyprus","Turkon, H (corresponding author), Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Biochem, TR-17100 Canakkale, Turkey.",,"Eroğlu, Mustafa/AAC-1081-2020","Eroğlu, Mustafa/0000-0002-7526-7151",,,"Arnaldi G, 2012, BEST PRACT RES CL EN, V26, P405, DOI 10.1016/j.beem.2011.12.00; Bar-Or D, 2000, J EMERG MED, V19, P311, DOI 10.1016/S0736-4679(00)00255-; Bittner JG, 2012, J SURG ONCOL, V106, P557, DOI 10.1002/jso.2316; Caglar GS, 2011, FERTIL STERIL, V95, P310, DOI 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.06.09; Cleeman JI, 2001, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V285, P2486, DOI 10.1001/jama.285.19.248; Garrapa GGM, 2001, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V86, P5301, DOI 10.1210/jc.86.11.530; Kaefer M, 2010, CLIN BIOCHEM, V43, P450, DOI 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2009.11.01; Karamouzis I, 2014, CLIN ENDOCRINOL OX; Kazanis K, 2009, CLIN CHIM ACTA, V408, P65, DOI 10.1016/j.cca.2009.07.00; Lippi G, 2009, ANN THORAC CARDIOVAS, V15, P13; Nieman LK, 2008, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V93, P1526, DOI 10.1210/jc.2008-012; Nieman LK, 2010, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V95, P4106, DOI 10.1210/jc.2010-045; Paschou S, 2015, ENDOCRIN; Prazny M, 2008, PHYSIOL RES, V57, P13, DOI 10.33549/physiolres.93112; Tauchmanova L, 2002, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V87, P4872, DOI 10.1210/jc.2001-01176; Terzolo M, 2002, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V87, P998, DOI 10.1210/jc.87.3.99; Gottlieb MGV, 2010, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V95, P586, DOI 10.1210/jc.2009-159",17,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,2.0,,,,,463.0,467,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QQ,WOS:000375338000031,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001756198347107438,1.1658471257965018e-10,0.003303223558884831,0.11132194813409235,0.003303223558884831

However, in clinical practice, patients are occasionally diagnosed with PTE despite normal D-dieter levels. In the present study, we reviewed the characteristics of cases in an emergency department (ED) in which a diagnosis of PTE was made despite normal D-dimer test results. Materials and methods: The hospital records of 107 patients who were admitted to the ED of a teaching hospital and diagnosed with PTE between January 2011 and December 2013 were reviewed retrospectively. We acquired data for 11 patients (10.2%) in whom D-dimer measurements obtained by an automated latex turbidimetric quantitative method were below 500 ng/ml (0-450). Results: Of the 11 patients, 72.7% (8/11) were female, and mean age was 71. +/- 57.9 (61-84) years. The most common symptom was dyspnea (54.5%, n=6). The mean delay between onset of symptoms and admission to the ED was 10.6 (3-30) days, and follow-ups were performed for patients in other health facilities for various causes of dyspnea. When risk factors were analyzed with the Wells score, 18.2% (2/11) of patients had low probability of PTE, whereas 72.7% (8/11) had intermediate, and 9% (1/11) had high probability. According to the revised Geneva score, 18.2% (2/11) of patients were found to have low probability, and 81.8% (9/11) had intermediate probability. The Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index score classified 18.2% (2/11) of the patients in the low risk group, and the European Society of Cardiology classification classified 81.8% (9/11) in the low risk group. Conclusion: In patients with nonspecific symptoms of PTE, the delay between onset of symptoms and admission to the ED is important. The risk factors of the patients and their pre-test probabilities should be considered along with D-dieter test results.","[Ozlem, Bilir; Gokhan, Ersunan; Asim, Kalkan; Ozcan, Yavasi; Kamil, Kayayurt] Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Fac Med, Dept Emergency Med, TR-53200 Rize, Turkey; [Baris, Giakoup] Rize State Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Rize, Turkey","Ozlem, B (corresponding author), Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Fac Med, Dept Emergency Med, TR-53200 Rize, Turkey.",,"Kalkan, Asim/AAE-3280-2020; YAVASI, OZCAN/AFP-3972-2022; Kalkan, Asim/AAF-3504-2019; Yavaşi, Özcan/AFQ-6296-2022","Kalkan, Asim/0000-0002-5800-0201; YAVASI, OZCAN/0000-0001-8641-7031; ",,,"ANDERSON FA, 1991, ARCH INTERN MED, V151, P933, DOI 10.1001/archinte.151.5.93; Anderson FA, 2003, CIRCULATION, V107, pI9, DOI 10.1161/01.CIR.0000078469.07362.E; BOUNAMEAUX H, 1991, LANCET, V337, P196, DOI 10.1016/0140-6736(91)92158-; Bruinstroop E, 2009, EUR J INTERN MED, V20, P441, DOI 10.1016/j.ejim.2008.12.00; Ceriani E, 2010, J THROMB HAEMOST, V8, P957, DOI 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2010.03801.; De Bastos M, 2006, J THROMB HAEMOST, V4, P2079, DOI 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2006.02063.; Di Nisio M, 2007, J THROMB HAEMOST, V5, P296, DOI 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2007.02328.; Douma RA, 2011, ANN INTERN MED, V154, DOI 10.7326/0003-4819-154-11-201106070-0000; Dunn KL, 2002, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V40, P1475, DOI 10.1016/S0735-1097(02)02172-; Duriseti RS, 2010, ANN EMERG MED, V56, P321, DOI 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2010.03.02; Eftychiou V, 1996, Nurse Pract, V21, P5; Gibson NS, 2008, CHEST, V134, P789, DOI 10.1378/chest.08-034; Guo ZG, 2014, CHINESE MED J-PEKING, V127, P18, DOI 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0366-6999.2013168; Gussoni G, 2013, THROMB RES, V131, P24, DOI 10.1016/j.thromres.2012.10.00; Kabrhel C, 2009, ACAD EMERG MED, V16, P325, DOI 10.1111/j.1553-2712.2009.00368.; Kearon C, 2006, ANN INTERN MED, V144, P812, DOI 10.7326/0003-4819-144-11-200606060-0000; Keeling DM, 2004, BRIT J HAEMATOL, V124, P15, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04723.; Koracevic GP, 2009, AM J EMERG MED, V27, P1016, DOI 10.1016/j.ajem.2008.11.01; Ku GH, 2009, BLOOD, V113, P3911, DOI 10.1182/blood-2008-08-17574; Kutinsky I, 1999, ARCH INTERN MED, V159, P1569, DOI 10.1001/archinte.159.14.156; Miniati M, 1999, AM J RESP CRIT CARE, V159, P864, DOI 10.1164/ajrccm.159.3.980613; Pasha SM, 2010, THROMB RES, V125, pE123, DOI 10.1016/j.thromres.2009.11.00; Pollack CV, 2011, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V57, P700, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2010.05.07; Righini M, 2008, J THROMB HAEMOST, V6, P1059, DOI 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2008.02981.; Rogers MAM, 2012, CIRCULATION, V125, P2092, DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.08446; Wood KE, 2002, CHEST, V121, P877, DOI 10.1378/chest.121.3.87",26,1,1,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,171.0,177,,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700027,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0026859504132231405,6.101414429693568e-20,0.004746697502217888,0.07162889130611731,0.004746697502217888

The incidence is approximately 10% during the lifetime. Although appendectomy is a most common surgical procedure worldwide, it's complication rate is 5-28% A delay in diagnosis of AA is associated with prolonged hospitalization, an increased rate of perforation (34%-75%), wound infection (0%-11%), pelvic abscess (1%-5%) and late intro-abdominal adhesions. Appendectomy is first described by McBurney in 1894 and still remains the standart procedure for AA. Although patients with AA often present with a characteristic symptom complex and physical findings, atypical presentations are common. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients who were operated for suspected acute appendicitis and to assess the discriminative effect of this ratio between wzinflamed, uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis. Materials and methods: The medical records of 3212 patients who underwent appendectomy for suspected acute appendicitis during a 10-year period were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were divided into 3 groups; group 1, 208 consecutive patients who had uninflamed appendix at appendectomy; group 2, 2111 consecutive patients who had uncomplicated acute appendicitis at appendectomy; group 3, 893 patients who had complicated appendicitis (perforated appendix or peri-appendicular abscess) at appendectomy. Data for three groups of patients were analyzed to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the NLR in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Receivers operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate this ratio in a relation with true diagnosis and severity of acute appendicitis. Results: 1792 (55.8%) of the patients were male and 1420 (44.2%) of them were female. The mean age of the groups were 30.28 +/- 14.18, 29.98 +/- 12.63 and 33.81 +/- 16.27 respectively. The discriminative effect of NLR was higher between uninflamed and complicated appendicitis groups with a cut-off value of 3,94. The recommended cut-off value of the preoperative NLR was decided using ROC curve analyses. The recommended cut-off value of the NLR was based on the most prominent point on the ROC curve for sensitivity (82.2%) and specificity (56.5%). The area under the ROC curve was 0.74. Conclusion: AA is one of the most common surgical emergencies and the most common source of infection in community acquired intra-abdominal infections. However the diagnosis is often challenging and the decision to operate, observe or further work-up on a patient is often unclear. Initial management of patients with suspected AA is based on the history of the patient, physical examination, basic laboratory tests reflecting the inflammatory response and radiologic imaging. NLR is a helpful biochemical parameter for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis but it has limited value on differentiating patients with complicated appendicitis from patients with uninflamed and uncomplicated appendicitis.","[Ozturk, S.; Unver, M.; Yoldas, O.] Izmir Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, Izmir, Turkey; [Dizen, H.] Eskisehir Yunus Emre State Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Eskisehir, Turkey; [Erol, V] Baskent Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, Ankara, Turkey; [Bozbiyik, O.] Ege Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gen Surg, Izmir, Turkey; [Guner, M.; Pehlivanoglu, K.; Kebapci, B.; Aydin, C.; Akbulut, G.] Tepecik Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Izmir, Turkey","Ozturk, S (corresponding author), Yeni Girne Bulvari 1825 Sokak 12, Karsiyaka Izmir, Turkey.",,"Aydin, Cengiz/AAL-6664-2020; Ünver, Mutlu/AAA-1673-2021","Aydin, Cengiz/0000-0003-4713-2871; Guner, Murat/0000-0002-3463-8550",,,"Acarturk G, 2015, BRATISL MED J, V116, P213, DOI 10.4149/BLL_2015_04; Al-Khayal KA, 2007, SAUDI MED J, V28, P17; Albayrak Y, 2011, CLIN APPL THROMB-HEM, V17, P362, DOI 10.1177/107602961036452; BECK JR, 1986, ARCH PATHOL LAB MED, V110, P1; Blackmore C, 2015, CAN J SURG, V58, P431, DOI 10.1503/cjs.01271; BOLTON JP, 1975, BRIT J SURG, V62, P906, DOI 10.1002/bjs.180062111; Brigand C, 2009, J CHIR-PARIS, V146, pS2, DOI 10.1016/j.jchir.2009.08.00; Caglayan F, 2003, J INVEST SURG, V16, P233, DOI 10.1080/0894193039021503; Chong CF, 2010, SINGAP MED J, V51, P22; Coleman C, 1998, AM SURGEON, V64, P98; CURRAN TJ, 1993, J PEDIATR SURG, V28, P204, DOI 10.1016/S0022-3468(05)80276-; DUEHOLM S, 1989, DIS COLON RECTUM, V32, P855, DOI 10.1007/BF0255455; ERIKSSON S, 1994, SCAND J GASTROENTERO, V29, P1145, DOI 10.3109/0036552940909490; GILBERT SR, 1985, SURG GYNECOL OBSTET, V161, P26; GOODMAN DA, 1995, AM SURGEON, V61, P25; GRAHAM JM, 1980, AM J SURG, V139, P247, DOI 10.1016/0002-9610(80)90265-; GRONROOS JM, 1994, CLIN CHEM, V40, P175; Hallan S, 1997, EUR J SURG, V163, P53; HANLEY JA, 1982, RADIOLOGY, V143, P29, DOI 10.1148/radiology.143.1.706374; JAHANGIRI M, 1990, BRIT MED J, V301, P215, DOI 10.1136/bmj.301.6745.21; Jang Sung Ouk, 2008, Korean J Gastroenterol, V52, P2; Keskek M, 2008, AM J EMERG MED, V26, P769, DOI 10.1016/j.ajem.2007.10.03; Kozar RA, 1999, PRINCIPLES SURG, P138; Markar SR, 2010, ACTA CHIR BELG, V110, P543, DOI 10.1080/00015458.2010.1168067; Pal K M, 1998, J Pak Med Assoc, V48, P18; Parks NA, 2011, SURG CLIN N AM, V91, P141, DOI 10.1016/j.suc.2010.10.01; PEARL RH, 1995, J PEDIATR SURG, V30, P173, DOI 10.1016/0022-3468(95)90556-; Rodriguez-Sanjuan JC, 1999, DIS COLON RECTUM, V42, P1325, DOI 10.1007/BF0223422; Sallinen V, 2016, BRIT J SURG, V103, P656, DOI 10.1002/bjs.1014; Sartelli M, 2012, WORLD J EMERG SURG, V7, DOI 10.1186/1749-7922-7-1; SASSO RD, 1970, AM J SURG, V120, P563, DOI 10.1016/S0002-9610(70)80168-; Shafi Sheikh Muzamil, 2009, Saudi J Gastroenterol, V15, P117, DOI 10.4103/1319-3767.4896; STONE HH, 1971, SURGERY, V69, P67; SURANA R, 1995, PEDIATR SURG INT, V10, P7; Tan TP, 2015, ANZ J SURG, V85, P414, DOI 10.1111/ans.1303; Tanrikulu Y, 2015, ULUS TRAVMA ACIL CER, V21, P440, DOI 10.5505/tjtes.2015.7750; Terasawa T, 2004, ANN INTERN MED, V141, P537, DOI 10.7326/0003-4819-141-7-200410050-0001; Terlinder J, 2016, SCAND J GASTROENTERO, V51, P; Yang HR, 2005, AM SURGEON, V71, P34; Yang JJ, 2015, WORLD J GASTROENTERO, V21, P2807, DOI 10.3748/wjg.v21.i9.280; Yildirim M, 2015, GYNECOL OBSTET INVES, V80, P234, DOI 10.1159/00037176; Zahorec R, 2001, Bratisl Lek Listy, V102, P",42,0,0,0,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,799.0,804,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_93,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400022,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0043388429752066115,3.7154010134935436e-14,0.0096270113307795,0.09779259483760165,0.009505447044065904

CP remarkably influences the life of those affected and their families. For this reason it is important and necessary to direct attention not only type of the CP, but also the impact the disorder has on the child, parents, siblings and the entire family as a whole. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of CP on the child's quality of life, considering parents' perceptions about their child's illness, in order to underline the impact the illness has not only on the child but also his/her family. Methods: The study included both parents of the 36 subjects enrolled (19 males and 17 females), with established CP diagnosis. The effect of CP on the families was assessed using the Impact of Childhood Illness Scale. This questionnaire assesses the quality of life in children with epilepsy and other chronic pathologies and in their families. All questions refer to effect to the illness family. The scale comprises 30 questions divided into four sections: impact of illness and its treatment; impact on development and child s adjustment; impact on parents and impact on the family. Descriptive analyses were used for data analysis and it is also calculated the rank correlation coefficient Spearman's rho. Results and conclusion: The mothers' group presents little higher average scores than the group of fathers in two four subscales or in the basement Impact on the child and Family impact on the organization. This could be due to the fact that mothers are concerned most of the child's caregiver, living most of all the difficulties that entails; mothers show greater concerns than fathers. In subscale Impact on parents the average score of the answers of the group of mothers coincide with that of the fathers; the experience and the experience of his son's illness is analogous for both parents. No significant differences were found from the correlational analysis between the individual items of the subscales and the different forms of CP. In families of children with CP, strategies for optimizing caregiver physical and psychological health include supports for behavioral management and daily functional activities as well as stress management and self-efficacy techniques.","[Parisi, Lucia; Di Filippo, Teresa; Russotto, Carmen; Maltese, Agata; Roccella, Michele] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Ruberto, Maria] Univ Naples 2, Dept Med Surg & Dent Specialties, Caserta, CE, Italy; [Precenzano, Francesco] Univ Naples 2, Dept Mental & Phys Hlth & Prevent Med, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Caserta, CE, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, I-90133 Palermo, Italy","Roccella, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",,,"Precenzano, Francesco/0000-0002-3812-1786",,,"Aisen ML, 2011, LANCET NEUROL, V10, P844, DOI 10.1016/S1474-4422(11)70176-; Basaran A, 2013, EUR J PHYS REHAB MED, V49, P81; Bellini B, 2013, J HEADACHE PAIN, V14, DOI 10.1186/1129-2377-14-7; Berker AN, 2008, PEDIATR CLIN N AM, V55, P1209, DOI 10.1016/j.pcl.2008.07.01; Boling S, 2016, DISABIL REHABIL, V38, P683, DOI 10.3109/09638288.2015.106160; Byrne MB, 2010, CHILD CARE HLTH DEV, V36, P696, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2214.2009.01047.; Carotenuto M, 2016, ACTA PAEDIATR, V105, P1079, DOI 10.1111/apa.1347; Carotenuto M, 2011, MINERVA PEDIATR, V63, P10; Carotenuto M, 2014, EPILEPSY BEHAV, V35, P50, DOI 10.1016/j.yebeh.2014.03.00; Carotenuto M, 2013, WORLD J PEDIATR, V9, P312, DOI 10.1007/s12519-013-0441-; Carotenuto M, 2013, SLEEP BREATH, V17, P877, DOI 10.1007/s11325-012-0697-; Dambi JM, 2016, SYST REV-LONDON, V5, DOI 10.1186/s13643-016-0219-; Dambi JM, 2015, INT J SCI RES PUBLIC, V5, P1; Davis E, 2010, CHILD CARE HLTH DEV, V36, P63, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2214.2009.00989.; Di Filippo T, 2013, MINERVA PEDIATR, V65, P59; Eker L, 2004, DISABIL REHABIL, V26, P1354, DOI 10.1080/0963828040000018; Esposito M, 2014, J INTELL DISABIL RES, V58, P421, DOI 10.1111/jir.1203; Esposito M, 2014, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V10, P141, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5551; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1803, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5385; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1513, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5271; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1351, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5155; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1187, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5045; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1061, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4936; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P351, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4281; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4218; Esposito M, 2012, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V8, P509, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S3686; Esposito M, 2012, EUR J PEDIATR, V171, P1599, DOI 10.1007/s00431-012-1759-; Esposito M, 2010, NEUROSCI LETT, V485, P89, DOI 10.1016/j.neulet.2010.08.06; Gagliardi C, 2008, PEDIATR NEUROL, V39, P335, DOI 10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2008.07.02; Garip Y, 2017, DISABIL REHABIL, V39, P757, DOI 10.3109/09638288.2016.116183; HOARE P, 1995, DEV MED CHILD NEUROL, V37, P68; Montalbano R, 2009, Minerva Pediatr, V61, P36; Odding E, 2006, DISABIL REHABIL, V28, P183, DOI 10.1080/0963828050015842; Oh H, 2009, INT J DISABIL DEV ED, V56, P149, DOI 10.1080/1034912090286862; Parisi L, 2016, MENT ILLN, V8, P5, DOI 10.4081/mi.2016.630; Raina P, 2005, PEDIATRICS, V115, pE626, DOI 10.1542/peds.2004-168; Santamaria F, 2014, RESPIROLOGY, V19, P570, DOI 10.1111/resp.1227; Verrotti A, 2015, PEDIATR OBES, V10, P220, DOI 10.1111/ijpo.24; Yilmaz H, 2013, EUR J PHYS REHAB MED, V49, P82",39,11,11,0,17,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_147,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000018,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003409090909090909,0.03352350885569376,0.0035857514356981974,0.1106121376252671,0.00356388876668009

It has been observed that, during the performance of a maximal exercise, in the central nervous system (CNS) increases the use of lactate and glucose. Moreover; it has been described that during a maximal exercise the increase of blood lactate is associated with a worsening of attentive processes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether high levels of Lactate are capable of influencing other cognitive domains as Short-term memory. Materials and methods: Fifteen male and healthy athletes participated in the research. Short-term memory span was carried through the Italian computerized version of Wechsler's Digit Span. The subjects were asked to perform an incremental cycling test on a mechanically braked cycloergometer. The measurement of values of blood lactate and the assessment of Short-term memory through the Italian computerized version of Wechsler's Digit Span were performed in three specific moments: 1) at rest (before); 2) immediately after performing an exhaustive exercise (end); 3) 10 minutes after the end of the exercise (10 min). Results: Blood lactate levels increased ftom 1.5 mmol/l (+/- 0.21) at rest (pre), to 12.0 mmol/l (+/- 2.14) immediately after the exercise (end), and decreased to 1.6 mmol/l (+/- 0.21) 10 min after its conclusion (post). In parallel, we observed that the digit span shows a worsening of short term memory at the end of exercised and returned to the pre-exercise values within 10 min after the conclusion of exercise. Conclusion: The present results show that high levels of blood lactate, as those induced with an exhaustive exercise, influence the cognitive domain of the memory in the same way observed for the cognitive domain of attention.","[Perciavalle, Valentina] Univ Catania, Dept Format Proc, I-95124 Catania, Italy; [Buscemi, Andrea; Borbone, Carlo; Catania, Andrea; Petralia, Maria Cristina; Puglisi, Maria Luisa; Coco, Lucio S.

Recently, some researchers have suggested that the underlying epileptogenic mechanism of absence seizures selectively involves the frontal cortical circuits, also supported by video-electroencephalography data(3). These data may be considered as a new window in CAE comprehension and management, particularly about symptoms different from seizure that children affected may present. In this light, aim of the present study is evaluating the presence of internalizing problems in prepubertal children affected by CAE. Material and methods: 18 patients (10 females, 8 males) ranging age from 8-11 years (mean age 9.36 +/- 1.32) affected by typical CAE were recruited. Control group was composed by 43 subjects (32 females, 11 males) (mean age 8.54 +/- 2.01). All subjects were screened for internalizing symptoms with SAFA-A scale and CDI test. Results: The two groups were comparable for age (p= 0.117) and sex distribution (p= 0.251). CAE children showed significantly higher score than controls for anxiety (p< 0.001) and depressive symptoms screening tests (p< 0.001) (Table 1). Conclusions: Results of present study suggest the importance of screening for anxiety and depressive signs in CAE children, in order to optimize their management beyond the exclusive idea to control and stop epileptic seizure only.","[Precenzano, Francesco;

Sleep disorders may be considered as a not secondary underlying cause of ADHD and growing evidence evidenced that obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) symptoms may overlap ADHD's ones. Aim of the present study is verifying the presence of ADHD-like symptoms in other frequent condition such as sleep-related breathing disorders in pediatric age. Materials and methods: 34 children (19 males and 15 females) aged 6-10 years (mean age 9.706 +/- 3.434) with polysomnographic diagnosis of OSA, according to ICSD-3 criteria, were recruited. Control group was composed by 89 typical developing children (47 males, 42 females) (mean age 9,528 +/- 3,351). The Conners' Rating Scale-Revised (CRS-R) test was administered to mothers to assess their children's behavior. Results: The two groups are comparable for age (p = 0.794) and sex distribution (p = 0.918). Subjects affected by OSA present higher scores in pathological range in all scales of CRS-R than controls (Table 1). Conclusions: Scientific and clinical evidences tend to stress the similarities between ADHD and OSA effects/comorbidities in pediatric age, suggesting sleep screening as mandatory before starting stimulant drugs treatment.","[Precenzano, Francesco;

Several studies pinpointed the role of parenting on BIF management. Aim of present study was evaluating with objective and validated tool the parental stress rate in mothers of an Italian sample of BIF children. Materials and methods: 26 BIF children (20 males and 6 females) aged 6-10 years (mean age 10.36 +/- 2.03), according to DSM-5 criteria, and 53 (42 males and 11 females) typical developing children (mean age 10.58 +/- 1.97) were recruited for present study. Mothers of all enrolled children underwent an evaluation with Parental Stress Index (PSI) test. Results: The two studied groups were comparable for age (p = 0.646) and gender (p = 0.956). Table 1 shows comparison between BIF and Control groups among PSI-SF scale results (Table 1), specifically mothers of BIF children have a significantly higher levels of global parental stress (p < 0.001), stress related to parenting (p < 0.001), stress linked to difficult child (p < 0.001) and stress related to parent-child interaction (p < 0.001) than mothers of control children. (Table 1) Conclusion: Several reports showed the key role of BIF as risk factor for psychiatric troubles and poor long-term adjustment. Our findings emphasize the need to approach this condition also from a family point of view, stressing that care should not be limited to child rehabilitative treatment but must also involve a family centered intervention.","[Precenzano, Francesco; D'Alessandro, Ilaria; Grappa, Maria Francesca; Magliulo, Rosaria Martina] Univ Naples 2, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Headache Ctr Children & Adolescents, Caserta Ce, Italy; [Precenzano, Francesco; D'Alessandro, Ilaria; Grappa, Maria Francesca; Magliulo, Rosaria Martina] Univ Naples 2, Dept Mental Hlth & Phys & Prevent Med, Caserta Ce, Italy; [Ruberto, Maria] Univ Naples 2, Dept Med Surg & Dent Specialties, Caserta Ce, Italy; [Parisi, Lucia; Maltese, Agata; Roccella, Michele] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Messina, Giovanni] Univ Foggia, Dept Expt Med, Sect Human Physiol, Foggia, Italy; [Messina, Giovanni] Univ Foggia, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Unit Dietet & Sports Med, Foggia, Italy","Roccella, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",,"Messina, Giovanni/AAE-8668-2022","Messina, Giovanni/0000-0002-0011-867X",,,"ABDIN R, 1990, PARENTING STRESS IN; Abidin R.R., 2012, PARENTING STRESS IND, VFourt; Amjad RN, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P130; [Anonymous], 2013, DIAGN STAT MAN MEN; Carotenuto M, 2011, MINERVA PEDIATR, V63, P10; Carotenuto M, 2009, J ENDOCRINOL INVEST, V32, P752, DOI [10.1007/BF03346531, 10.3275/6398; Carotenuto M, 2013, WORLD J PEDIATR, V9, P312, DOI 10.1007/s12519-013-0441-; Carotenuto M, 2013, MED HYPOTHESES, V81, P306, DOI 10.1016/j.mehy.2013.04.02; Carotenuto M, 2013, SLEEP BREATH, V17, P93, DOI 10.1007/s11325-012-0654-; Carotenuto M, 2012, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V8, P369, DOI [10.2147/NDT.S35974, 10.2147/NDT.535974; Carotenuto M, 2011, SLEEP BREATH, V15, P221, DOI 10.1007/s11325-010-0388-; Chieffi S, 2014, EXP BRAIN RES, V232, P3659, DOI 10.1007/s00221-014-4056-; Emerson E, 2010, SOC PSYCH PSYCH EPID, V45, P579, DOI 10.1007/s00127-009-0100-; Esposito M, 2014, J INTELL DISABIL RES, V58, P421, DOI 10.1111/jir.1203; Esposito M, 2011, MINERVA PEDIATR, V63, P9; Esposito M, 2014, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V10, P1897, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S6979; Esposito M, 2014, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V10, P141, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5551; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1351, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5155; Esposito Maria, 2013, Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat, V9, P1087, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4728; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1187, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5045; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1061, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4936; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P921, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4677; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P437, DOI [10.2147/NDT.543673, 10.2147/NDT.S43673; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P351, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4281; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4218; Esposito M, 2012, NEUROL SCI, V33, P1365, DOI 10.1007/s10072-012-1019-; Esposito M, 2010, NEUROSCI LETT, V485, P89, DOI 10.1016/j.neulet.2010.08.06; Esposito T, 2016, DRUG DES DEV THER, V10, P2939, DOI 10.2147/DDDT.S10644; Fantauzzo G, 2010, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V26, P5; Fenning RM, 2007, AM J MENT RETARD, V112, P107, DOI 10.1352/0895-8017(2007)112[107:PCWBIF]2.0.CO;; Fenning RM, 2014, J FAM PSYCHOL, V28, P326, DOI 10.1037/a003653; Fernell E, 2010, ACTA PAEDIATR, V99, P748, DOI 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2010.01707.; Franzoni E, 2015, EUR J PAEDIATR NEURO, V19, P660, DOI 10.1016/j.ejpn.2015.07.00; Guzzetta A, 2010, DEV MED CHILD NEUROL, V52, P767, DOI 10.1111/j.1469-8749.2009.03497.; Hamissi JH, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P133; Hassiotis A, 2008, J INTELL DISABIL RES, V52, P95, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2007.01001.; Jalili Z, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P91; Katirci Y, 2013, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V29, P71; Messina A, 2016, FRONT NEURAL CIRCUIT, V10, DOI 10.3389/fncir.2016.0006; Messina G, 2016, J BASIC CLIN PH 0926, DOI 10.1515/jbcpp-2015-013; Messina G, 2014, FRONT PSYCHOL, V5, DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.0099; Mirzaei-Alavijeh M, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P101; Moscatelli F, 2016, NEUROL SCI      082; Pasquali D, 2015, ENDOCRINE, V50, P797, DOI 10.1007/s12020-015-0564-; Perillo L, 2014, PATIENT PREFER ADHER, V8, P353, DOI 10.2147/PPA.S5897; Shams S, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P155; Verrotti A, 2015, J NEUROL, V262, P116, DOI 10.1007/s00415-014-7542-; Yongli Z, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P117",48,47,47,2,10,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1761.0,1765,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_160,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300004,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0043388429752066115,0.045367814346014015,0.22998729276404398,0.12645164661467517,0.23270656235842654

The objective of this study was to analyze all components of the metabolic syndrome in subjects with increased waist circumference, with the hypothesis that even in normal weighted apparently healthy subjects the metabolic profile is already modified. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between February 2013 and April 2014. The sample consisted of 266 consecutive patients presenting to the Endocrinology Outpatient Clinic of the Emergency Mures County Hospital for consultation who signed the informed consent. Inclusion criteria - waist circumference above 80cm for females and >94cm for males. Exclusion criteria - secondary causes of increased abdominal circumference: pregnancy, generalized edema, endocrine causes: untreated hypo-or hyperthyroidism, Cushing syndrome, medications that could lead to weight gain/loss, weight losing diet and refusal to participate. For all patients, height, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure were measured by the same person. Venous blood samples were taken for determination of fasting blood glucose, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. Microsoft Office Excel was used for data collection and GraphPad Prism v. 5 for statistical analysis, with a level of significance alpha=0.05. Results: Mean age of the sample was 51 +/- 12.7 years with a median of 53 years and a sex ratio F:M of 8.1:1. The normal weighted subjects had a high prevalence of associated disturbances (34.41% hypertriglyceridemia, 37.63% low HDL cholesterol, 29.03% increased blood glucose and 44.09% hypertension). Metabolically healthy obese represented 17.29% (n=46) of the sample. When comparing the metabolically healthy subjects with abdominal obesity to the metabolically unhealthy subjects, the former are younger (41.4 vs. 53.1 years, p<0.0001), thinner (BMI 28.7 vs. 32.5 kg/sqm, p<0.0001) and with significantly smaller differences of the waist compared to the IDF cut-offs (11 vs. 20.2cm, p<0.0001). Conclusions: Waist circumference is an important clinical parameter which correlates with all the elements of the metabolic syndrome. Increased waist circumference should elicit metabolical evaluation and lifestyle modifications.","[Raluca, Pop] Univ Med & Pharm Tirgu Mures, Med Res Methodol Dept, Targu Mures, Romania; [Raluca, Pop] Univ Dunarea De Jos, Endocrinol Outpatient Clin, Emergency Mures Cty Hosp, Fac Med,Clin Med Dept 3, Galati, Romania; [Aurelia, Romila] Univ Med & Pharm Tirgu Mures, Clin Geriatr Dept, Galati Cty Hosp Emergency, Targu Mures, Romania; [Marian, Pop] Univ Med & Pharm Tirgu Mures, Targu Mures, Romania; [Bacarea, Anca] Univ Med & Pharm Tirgu Mures, Dept Pathophysiol, Targu Mures, Romania","Aurelia, R (corresponding author), Univ Dunarea De Jos, Dept Clin Med, Fac Med, Galati 1,Vadu Sacalelor St,Bl Pescarus,Ap 8, Galati, Romania.",,"Pop, Raluca/AAS-7928-2020; Pop, Marian/S-5302-2019; Bacarea, Anca/AAW-9459-2020","Pop, Marian/0000-0001-5324-9780; Pop, Raluca/0000-0003-1243-1855; Pop, Raluca-Monica/0000-0003-1775-4469",University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Tirgu Mures [5/23.12.2014],This project was supported in part by University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Tirgu Mures through Internal Research Grant 5/23.12.2014,"Alberti KGMM, 2009, CIRCULATION, V120, P1640, DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.19264; Alberti KGMM, 1998, DIABETIC MED, V15, P539, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9136(199807)15:7<539::AID-DIA668>3.0.CO;2-; Balkau B, 1999, DIABETIC MED, V16, P44; Berezina A, 2015, BIOMED RES INT, V2015, DOI 10.1155/2015/54873; Carey DGP, 1996, INT J OBESITY, V20, P72; Carmienke S, 2013, EUR J CLIN NUTR, V67, P573, DOI 10.1038/ejcn.2013.6; Cleeman JI, 2001, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V285, P2486, DOI 10.1001/jama.285.19.248; Demirbas B, 2016, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V32, P4; Grundy SM, 2015, EUR J CLIN INVEST, V45, P1209, DOI 10.1111/eci.1251; Hinnouho GM, 2015, EUR HEART J, V36, P551, DOI 10.1093/eurheartj/ehu12; Hwang YC, 2015, INT J OBESITY, V39, P1365, DOI 10.1038/ijo.2015.7; Janssen I, 2004, AM J CLIN NUTR, V79, P37; Karelis AD, 2005, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V90, P4145, DOI 10.1210/jc.2005-048; Munoz-Garach A, 2016, NUTRIENTS, V8, DOI 10.3390/nu806032; Phillips CM, 2013, PLOS ONE, V8, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.007618; Premanath M, 2014, Indian J Endocrinol Metab, V18, P676, DOI 10.4103/2230-8210.13923; REAVEN GM, 1988, DIABETES, V37, P1595, DOI 10.2337/diabetes.37.12.159; Rocha FL, 2013, REV ASSOC MED BRAS, V59, P48, DOI 10.1590/S0104-4230201300010001; Roskam AJR, 2010, INT J EPIDEMIOL, V39, P392, DOI 10.1093/ije/dyp32; Ruderman N, 1998, DIABETES, V47, P699, DOI 10.2337/diabetes.47.5.69; World Health Organization, 2011, WAIST CIRC WAIST HI; Yu Y, 2012, OBESITY, V20, P904, DOI 10.1038/oby.2011.30; Zheng H, 2013, AM J EPIDEMIOL, V178, P1591, DOI 10.1093/aje/kwt17",23,0,0,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1821.0,1825,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_169,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300013,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0024793388429752063,4.0408519452906773e-08,0.08337888427798203,0.13183161507347432,0.08018072919418888

Among all medical imaging technologies; using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is significant. The aim of this study was to determine the appropriateness of knee MRI prescription in Sabzevar Vasei hospital in 2014. Materials and methods: This study is descriptive and analytic, while the statistical population included 115 patients referred to MRI Unit in Sabzevar Vasei hospital, while they were selected randomly. A questionnaire was used for data collection and to determine the appropriateness of prescription; a local clinical guideline was used as well. Data analysis was done by using SPSS16, descriptive statistics, Spearman test, Pearson chi-square and Fisher exact tests. Results: Among 115 prescribed knee MRI patients, 52 prescriptions (45.2%) were inappropriate, 2 prescriptions (1.7%) were uncertain and 61 prescriptions (53%) were considered appropriate. The financial burden arising from inappropriate prescriptions was 39204000 Rials. Besides, there is a significant difference between the appropriate prescriptions and patients' gender, occupation, education, the specialty of a prescriber physician as well as referral institution (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Considering the high rate of inappropriate prescriptions, it is essential to find some reasons and to do continuous monitoring. The use of local clinical guidelines can improve the quality of the health system and avoid additional costs.","[Refahi, Soheila] Ardabil Univ Med Sci, Ardebil, Iran; [Kachooei, Amir Reza] Mashhad Univ Med Sci, Mashhad, Iran; [Farsadpour, Majid; Shahrayeni, Ramin; Foji, Samira; Malekkahi, Akram; Salari, Mozhdeh] Sabzevar Univ Med Sci, Sabzevar, Iran; [Goudarzian, Maryam; Amiri, Parastoo] Sabzevar Univ Med Sci, Iranian Res Ctr Hlth Aging, Sabzevar, Iran; [Taleghani, Yasamin Molavi] Isfahan Univ Med Sci, Hlth Management & Econ Res Ctr, Esfahan, Iran; [Vejdani, Marjan] Sabzevar Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Sabzevar, Iran","Vejdani, M (corresponding author), Sabzevar Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Sabzevar, Iran.",marjan_vejdani@yahoo.com,"Kachooei, Amir/H-3186-2019; refahi, soheila/R-6915-2017","Kachooei, Amir/0000-0001-7795-1830; Refahi, Soheila/0000-0002-7973-647X; Vejdani, Marjan/0000-0002-8683-4916; Amiri, Parastoo/0000-0002-3085-8652; Shahraini, Ramin/0000-0002-3854-7429",,,"Abedi G, 2012, INT J COLLAB RES INT, V4, P180; Abedi G, 2012, INT J COLLAB RES INT, V4, P10; Alam NR, 2004, J MAZANDARAN U MED S, V1; Barzin M, 2012, J GORGAN U MED SCI, V1; Borowitz M, 1993, Health Econ, V2, P201, DOI 10.1002/hec.473002030; Chevalier Xavier, 2009, Rev Prat, V59, P124; Ebrahimipour H, 2015, HAKIM RES J, V1; Ebrahimipour H, 2014, ARCH BONE JT SURG-AB, V2, P4; Fisher ES, 2003, ANN INTERN MED, V138, P273, DOI 10.7326/0003-4819-138-4-200302180-0000; Fuchs VR, 2001, HEALTH AFFAIR, V20, P30, DOI 10.1377/hlthaff.20.5.3; Greenberg D, 2005, INT J TECHNOL ASSESS, V21, P219, DOI 10.1017/S026646230505029; Hamedi M, 2008, WHY IS DETERIORATIN; HICKS NR, 1994, BRIT MED J, V309, P730, DOI 10.1136/bmj.309.6956.73; HILLMAN AL, 1986, AM J ROENTGENOL, V146, P963, DOI 10.2214/ajr.146.5.96; Karami I., 2005, HEALTH ECON, P1; Keshtkaran A, 2011, EVALUATION APPROPRI; Kistka HM, 2015, J NEUROL SURG PART B, V76, P344, DOI 10.1055/s-0035-154930; Lee JY, 2014, J KOREAN MED SCI, V29, P1590, DOI 10.3346/jkms.2014.29.12.159; Lehnert BE, 2010, J AM COLL RADIOL, V7, P192, DOI 10.1016/j.jacr.2009.11.01; Marzban Sima, 2015, Electron Physician, V7, P1183, DOI 10.14661/2015.1183-118; Neisi K, 2006, J SCI MED, V; News IR., 2013, ADM UNNECESSARY ME; Nicollier-Fahrni A, 2003, INT J QUAL HEALTH C, V15, P15, DOI 10.1093/intqhc/15.1.1; Noureddine Y, 2015, MAGMA NEW YORK N; OC S, 2015, J SCI MED SPOR; Oh EH, 2005, INT J TECHNOL ASSESS, V21, P73, DOI 10.1017/S026646230505009; Palesh M, 2008, INT J TECHNOL ASSESS, V24, P452, DOI 10.1017/S026646230808059; Passariello R, 1997, Eur Radiol, V7 Suppl 5, P25; PHELPS CE, 1993, NEW ENGL J MED, V329, P1241, DOI 10.1056/NEJM19931021329170; Rezaei Y, 2007, TUMJ, V65, P4; Salari H, 2013, INT J HEALTH POLICY, V1, P17, DOI 10.15171/ijhpm.2013.0; Shukla J, 2015, INDIAN J NUCL MED, V30, P295, DOI 10.4103/0972-3919.16401; Vincenzino J V, 1991, Stat Bull Metrop Insur Co, V72, P; Xie L, 2015, BMC MUSCULOSKEL DIS, V16, DOI 10.1186/s12891-015-0716-; Yazdani S, 2002, J OPHTHALMOLOGY BINA, V",35,4,4,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,4.0,,1207.0,1211,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YQ,WOS:000392283200004,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003615702479338843,1.1723589096944107e-11,0.01576582026152442,0.10620439958308191,0.016971597783594347

When untreated, SRBD and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) mainly, may impact school performance, cognition, metabolism, and cardiovascular function. Aim of the present study is assessing the visuomotor integration skills in children affected by OSA. Materials and methods: 57 subjects affected by mild-to severe OSA, PSG diagnosed according to international diagnostic criteria, (31 males and 26 females) (mean age 10.8; SD +/- 2.49) and 83 healthy children (45 males and 38 females) (mean age 9.95; SD +/- 1.87; p = 0.725). All subjects underwent assessment of motor coordination skills with Movement-ABC tests and visual-motor integration ability with Visual Motor Integration (VMI) test. Results: The subjects with OSA show a worse average performances in all items of Movement ABC (p < 0.001) respect of controls. Specifically, children with OSAS show significantly higher values of total points (p < 0.001), manual dexterity (p < 0.001), ball skills (p < 0.001) and balance (p < 0.001). Accordingly, the average centile in OSA children at the MABC-test is significantly reduced compared with controls (p < 0.001). (Table 1) On the other hand, the VMI test evaluation among children with OSAS shows worst result in total Visuo-Motor Integration (p < 0.001), and in Motor Coordination sub-item (p < 0.001) than controls. (Table 1). Conclusion: Our results also support for children and adolescents the hypothesis that executive functioning deficits might be linked primarily to the degree of severity nocturnal hypoxemia rather than daytime sleepiness, although several other studies are needed.","[Ruberto, Maria] Univ Naples 2, Dept Mental Hlth & Phys Med & Prevented, Headache Ctr Children & Adolescents, Clin Child & Adolescent Neuropsychiat, Naples, Italy; [Precenzano, Francesco] Univ Naples 2, Dept Med Surg & Dent Specialties, Naples, Italy; [Parisi, Lucia; Maltese, Agata; Roccella, Michele] Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Salerno, Margherita] Univ Palermo, Sci Mother & Child Hlth Promot, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Messina, Giovanni] Univ Foggia, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Foggia, Italy; [Messina, Giovanni] Univ Naples 2, Dept Expt Med, Naples, Italy","Roccella, M (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Dept Psychol Pedag & Educ Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",,"Messina, Giovanni/AAE-8668-2022","Messina, Giovanni/0000-0002-0011-867X; Precenzano, Francesco/0000-0002-3812-1786",,,"Balottin U, 2007, EXPERT OPIN PHARMACO, V8, P731, DOI 10.1517/14656566.8.6.73; Balottin U, 2013, CEPHALALGIA, V33, P112, DOI 10.1177/033310241246838; Balottin U, 2011, MED HYPOTHESES, V76, P778, DOI 10.1016/j.mehy.2011.02.01; Beery KE, 2004, BEERY BUKTENICA DEV, V; Blechner M, 2016, CURR PROB PEDIATR AD, V46, P19, DOI 10.1016/j.cppeds.2015.10.00; Borgatti R, 2004, J CHILD NEUROL, V19, P509, DOI 10.1177/0883073804019007060; Calderoni S, 2013, J CLIN EXP NEUROPSYC, V35, P167, DOI 10.1080/13803395.2012.76053; Carotenuto M, 2016, ACTA PAEDIATR, V105, P1079, DOI 10.1111/apa.1347; Carotenuto M, 2011, MINERVA PEDIATR, V63, P10; Carotenuto M, 2010, MED HYPOTHESES, V75, P120, DOI 10.1016/j.mehy.2010.02.00; Carotenuto M, 2009, J ENDOCRINOL INVEST, V32, P752, DOI [10.1007/BF03346531, 10.3275/6398; Carotenuto M, 2014, EPILEPSY BEHAV, V35, P50, DOI 10.1016/j.yebeh.2014.03.00; Carotenuto M, 2013, MED HYPOTHESES, V81, P306, DOI 10.1016/j.mehy.2013.04.02; Carotenuto M, 2013, SLEEP BREATH, V17, P93, DOI 10.1007/s11325-012-0654-; Carotenuto M, 2012, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V8, P369, DOI [10.2147/NDT.S35974, 10.2147/NDT.535974; Carotenuto M, 2011, SLEEP BREATH, V15, P221, DOI 10.1007/s11325-010-0388-; Cavanna AE, 2013, BEHAV NEUROL, V27, P83, DOI [10.3233/BEN-120296, 10.1155/2013/732038; Esposito M, 2014, J INTELL DISABIL RES, V58, P421, DOI 10.1111/jir.1203; Esposito M, 2011, MINERVA PEDIATR, V63, P9; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1513, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5271; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1433, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5125; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1351, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5155; Esposito Maria, 2013, Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat, V9, P1087, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4728; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1187, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S5045; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P1061, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4936; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P921, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4677; Esposito M, 2013, J HEADACHE PAIN, V14, DOI 10.1186/1129-2377-14-5; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, P437, DOI [10.2147/NDT.543673, 10.2147/NDT.S43673; Esposito M, 2013, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V9, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S4218; Esposito M, 2012, NEUROPSYCH DIS TREAT, V8, P509, DOI 10.2147/NDT.S3686; Esposito M, 2012, EUR J PEDIATR, V171, P1599, DOI 10.1007/s00431-012-1759-; Esposito M, 2010, NEUROSCI LETT, V485, P89, DOI 10.1016/j.neulet.2010.08.06; Gozal David, 2012, Front Biosci (Elite Ed), V4, P241; Henderson S.

For this aim, 42 samples rice randomly selected from 10 Iranian and 4 imported brands from different parts of city. Results revealed that all samples were contaminated to zearalenone and the zearalenone average in Iranian and imported rice were 4.43 and 3.88 mu g/kg respectively. Given the zearalenone risks for human health, it is recommended the control of zearalenone production during harvesting, preserving, and storage of rice. Therefore, implementing health regulation and monitoring their enforcement, determine the maximum allowable amount of mycotoxins in food and attention of public health andnourishment specialists to this issues is most important.","[Sadeghi, Ehsan; Moradi, Masoud; Sharafi, Kiomars] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, RCEDH, Sch Publ Hlth, Kermanshah, Iran; [Barkhordar, Sodabeh; Mohammadi, Ghobad] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Food & Drugs Affairs, Kermanshah, Iran; [Asadi, Fateme; Nesari, Shiva] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Engn, Kermanshah, Iran; [Sharafi, Kiomars] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Engn, Tehran, Iran","Asadi, F (corresponding author), Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Publ HealthSchool, Dolat Abad,Isar Sq, Kermanshah, Iran.",f_asadi56@yahoo.com,"Asadmasjedi, Nooshin/D-7677-2018; Sharafi, Kiomars/CAF-0682-2022; Asadi, Fateme/Q-8256-2019; Moradi, Masoud/AAF-2174-2020; Mohammadi, Ghobad/S-2374-2017; Sadeghi, Ehsan/S-2246-2017","Moradi, Masoud/0000-0003-2036-5333; Sadeghi, Ehsan/0000-0002-1096-2380",,,"Azizi J, 2002, AGR DEV, V10, P10; Azizi J, 2004, AGR SCI ISLAMIC AZAD, V12, P71; Hussein HS, 2001, TOXICOLOGY, V167, P101, DOI 10.1016/S0300-483X(01)00471-; Ibanez-Vea M, 2011, FOOD CONTROL, V22, P1949, DOI 10.1016/j.foodcont.2011.05.00; Marasas WFO, 1984, TOXIGENIC FUSARIUM ; Musaiger AO, 2008, FOOD CONTROL, V19, P854, DOI 10.1016/j.foodcont.2007.08.01; Nguyen MT, 2007, FOOD CHEM, V105, P42, DOI 10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.03.04; Nori K, 2006, PAJOUHESH SAZANDEGI, P1; Nuryono N, 2005, FOOD CONTROL, V16, P65, DOI 10.1016/j.foodcont.2003.11.00; Pitt JI, 2000, MED MYCOL, V38, P17, DOI 10.1080/mmy.38.s1.17.2; Reddy KRN, 2009, PESTIC BIOCHEM PHYS, V93, P53, DOI 10.1016/j.pestbp.2008.11.00; Rezazadeh A, 2013, J PARAMEDICAL SCI, V; Schothorst RC, 2004, TOXICOL LETT, V153, P133, DOI 10.1016/j.toxlet.2004.04.04; Sharafi K, 2015, J SEP SCI, V38, P1010, DOI 10.1002/jssc.20140120; Sifou A, 2011, FOOD CONTROL, V22, P1826, DOI 10.1016/j.foodcont.2011.04.01; SOARES LMV, 1989, J ASSOC OFF ANA CHEM, V72, P2; Zinedine A, 2007, FOOD CHEM TOXICOL, V45, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.fct.2006.07.03; [No title captured",18,3,3,0,6,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,5.0,,1945.0,1949,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EI1YW,WOS:000392283800005,,,,,2022-07-14,0.001859504132231405,1.2112329286029793e-11,0.010086898960773047,0.10345970095016192,0.010086898960773047

The present study was done to find any relationship between NLR and number of diseased coronary arteries in patients underwent coronary angiography in Imam Ali University Hospital of Kermanshah, Iran between 2012 and 2014. In this retrospective study, medical records of 1,498 patients who underwent coronary angiography were reviewed. The data extracted were entered into a checklist. NLR was calculated using complete blood count (CBC) reports and the number of diseased coronary arteries was determined using coronary angiography reports. The data were analyzed using SPSS software (ver. 20.0) by analysis of variance (ANOVA), t test, Kruskal-Wallis, and Pearson correlation tests. There were significant (P<0.05) relationships between NLR, history of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), fasting blood sugar, serum creatinine and urea, white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin, platelet count, MCV (mean corpuscular volume), and with the number of diseased coronary arteries detected on coronary angiography. However, there was no significant relationship (P>0.05) between history of hyperlipidemia, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, type of cardiac chest pain (acute or chronic), serum total cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein), LDL (low-density lipoprotein), and triglyceride with the number of diseased coronary arteries. NLR was effective on the number of diseased coronary arteries (i.e., the severity of disease). Application of this laboratory factor can be helpful in patients with ischemic heart disease.","[Salehi, Nahid; Bahremand, Mostafa] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Cardiol Dept, Sch Med, Kermanshah, Iran; [Azam, Hossein] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Kermanshah, Iran","Bahremand, M (corresponding author), Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Cardiol Dept, Sch Med, Kermanshah, Iran.",dr-bahremand@kums.ac.ir,"Salehi, Nahid/S-5521-2017","Salehi, Nahid/0000-0002-4757-6336; Bahremand, Mostafa/0000-0002-3076-7398",,,"Abel p wakai, 2011, BMJ CLIN EVID, V201; An X, INTUROL NEPHROL, V25, P12; Arbel Y, 2012, ATHEROSCLEROSIS, V225, P456, DOI 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.09.00; Ates AH, 2011, CARDIOL J, V18, P37; Cho KH, 2011, AM J CARDIOL, V107, P849, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2010.10.06; Demir Mehmet, 2014, EVALUATION PLASMA EO, V69, P32; Dogan M, 2015, CLIN APPL THROMB-HEM, V21, P25, DOI 10.1177/107602961348893; Guasti L, 2011, THROMB HAEMOSTASIS, V106, P591, DOI 10.1160/TH11-02-009; Home BD, 2008, AM J CARDIOL, V102, P814, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.05.02; Karagoz A, 2015, EUR REV MED PHARMACO, V19, P43; Kaya H, 2014, CLIN APPL THROMB-HEM, V20, P50, DOI 10.1177/107602961245211; Kuklina Elena V, 1999, PREVALENCE CORONARY, V8, P32; Lee S, 2011, J EPIDEMIOL, V21, P161, DOI 10.2188/jea.JE2010012; Libby P, 2009, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V54, P2129, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2009.09.00; Madjid M, 2013, TEX HEART I J, V40, P1; Nilsson L, 2014, NEUTROPHIL LYMPHOCYT, V; Nunez J, 2005, REV ESP CARDIOL, V58, P631, DOI 10.1016/S1885-5857(06)60249-; Okyay GU, 2013, RENAL FAILURE, V35, P29, DOI 10.3109/0886022X.2012.73442; Ozgehan G, 2014, TURK J MED SCI, V20, P10; Pitsavos Christos, 2007, Rev Diabet Stud, V4, P98, DOI 10.1900/RDS.2007.4.9; Sari I, 2015, KARDIOL POL, V73, P1310, DOI 10.5603/KP.a2015.009; Sonmez O, 2013, ANATOL J CARDIOL, V13, P662, DOI 10.5152/akd.2013.18; Suliman MARM, 2010, ARCH MED RES, V41, P618, DOI 10.1016/j.arcmed.2010.11.00; Sunbul M, 2014, CLIN EXP HYPERTENS, V36, P217, DOI 10.3109/10641963.2013.80454; Swirta JS, 2015, CARDIOL POL, V73, P44; Tamhane UU, 2008, AM J CARDIOL, V102, P653, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.05.00; Tanaka M, 2012, HYPERTENS RES, V35, P325, DOI 10.1038/hr.2011.19; Toor IS, 2012, THROMB RES, V130, P607, DOI 10.1016/j.thromres.2012.05.03; Twig G, 2012, WHITE BLOOD CELL COU, V; Uthamalingam S, 2011, AM J CARDIOL, V107, P433, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2010.09.03",30,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,2.0,,947.0,952,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SU,WOS:000390175400015,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0030991735537190084,2.302253399988036e-16,0.005219329557906278,0.085386399922376,0.005314243731072487

In the present study we aimed to investigate whether complete blood count parameters can aid in the detection and the differential diagnosis of infarct positive Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), infarct-negative TIA, and ischemic stroke (IS) in patient followed up in the emergency department. Materials and methods: This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 252 patients meeting the medical history and physical examination criteria for TIA (n=99) and IS (n=153) Neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts, platelet distribution width (PDW), and mean platelet volume (MPV) levels obtained from the complete blood count taken at the time of emergency department admission were recorded for both patient and control groups; platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were calculated from these parameters. The ischemic stroke, TIA, and control groups, as well as other subgroups were compared with one another with respect to the complete blood count parameters. Results: Neutrophil count, MPV, and NLR levels were higher in the IS group compared to the control group whereas IS group had a lower lymphocyte count, platelet count, and a PDW level compared to the control group. TIA group had a higher neutrophil count, NLR and PLR than the control group whereas lymphocyte count and PDW level were lower in the TIA group compared to the control group. MPV level was higher in the IS and infarct-positive TIA patient group than both the control group and infarct-negative TIA patient group. Conclusion: Owing to high MPV levels in both infarct-positive TIA and IS, we suggest that MPV can be a good marker for infarction.

The treatment options are very limited in infections caused by multi drug resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa strains. Combinations of antimicrobials are frequently used in the treatment of MDR P. aeruginosa infections. In this study we investigated the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem(IMP), doripenem(DOR), colistin(CO) and polymyxin B (PO) alone and in vitro synergistic activity of carbapenem-polymixin combinations (IMP-CO, DOR-CO and DOR-PO) in MDR P. aeruginosa strains obtained from patients in ICUs. Materials and methods: Thirty P. aeruginosa strains isolated from various clinical specimens of patients in ICUs were included in the study. The epsilometer test(E test), which is a gradient diffusion method was used for determining synergistic activities of different antibiotic combinations. Synergistic, additive, indifferent and antagonist effects of P. aeruginosa strains were evaluated by fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index. Results: Of the 30 MDR P. aeruginosa strains tested, susceptibility rates for IMP, DOR and PO were 40%, 70% and 96.6%, respectively. Resistance to CO was not detected. IMP-CO, DOR-CO and DOR-PO combinations were found to have synergistic or additive effect in 19.9%, 3.3% and 3.3% of the tested strains, respectively. Conclusion: Combination therapy is recommended for the treatment of MDR P. aeruginosa infections in order to ensure synergistic action and decrease the risk of development of resistance. In this study, combinations of IMP-CO, DOR-CO and DOR-PO exhibited synergistic activity in some MDR P. aeruginosa strains. Among the tested antimicrobial combinations, IMP-CO combination was the most effective against MDR P. aeruginosa strains. The development of new combination therapy protocols will help clinicians in selecting appropriate agents for the treatments of infections caused by MDR bacteria.","[Sanal, Laser] Yuksek Ihtisas Training & Res Hosp, Microbiol Lab, TR-06420 Ankara, Turkey; [Sen, Suha] Yuksek Ihtisas Training & Res Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, Ankara, Turkey; [Cesur, Salih] Ankara Numune Training & Res Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, Ankara, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Neziha] Bozok Univ, Dept Microbiol, Yozgat, Turkey","Sanal, L (corresponding author), Yuksek Ihtisas Training & Res Hosp, Microbiol Lab, TR-06420 Ankara, Turkey.",,"yılmaz, neziha/AAH-3524-2020",,"Yuksek Ihtisas Training and Research Hospital, Project Ihtisas Training and Research Hospital [322-1]","This study was presented as a poster presentation in the 7th Eurasia Congress of Infectious Diseases between 30 September and 3 October 2015 in Tbilisi, Georgia and 30th National Congress of Antibiotic and Chemotherapy at 6-10 May 2015 in TRNC (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus) and was supported by a grant from Yuksek Ihtisas Training and Research Hospital, Project Ihtisas Training and Research Hospital, Project no: 322-1.","Aloush V, 2006, ANTIMICROB AGENTS CH, V50, P43, DOI 10.1128/AAC.50.1.43-48.200; CLSI Institute) LS, 2014, M100S24 CLS; Dundar D, 2010, YONSEI MED J, V51, P111, DOI 10.3349/ymj.2010.51.1.11; Falagas ME, 2005, CLIN INFECT DIS, V40, P1333, DOI 10.1086/42932; Fujimura T, 2009, INT J ANTIMICROB AG, V34, P523, DOI 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2009.07.00; Gellatly SL, 2013, PATHOG DIS, V67, P159, DOI 10.1111/2049-632X.1203; Guzel CB, 2008, CHEMOTHERAPY, V54, P147, DOI 10.1159/00011974; He W, 2012, DIAGN MICR INFEC DIS, V74, P417, DOI 10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2012.08.01; Jain SN., 2011, INT RES J PHARM, V2, P19; Kose S, 2014, ANKEM DERG, V28, P10; Manno G, 2003, EUR J CLIN MICROBIOL, V22, P28, DOI 10.1007/s10096-002-0852-; Michalopoulos A, 2005, CRIT CARE, V9, pR53, DOI 10.1186/cc302; Michalopoulos A, 2008, CRIT CARE CLIN, V24, P377, DOI 10.1016/j.ccc.2007.12.00; Mitsugui CS, 2011, INT J ANTIMICROB AG, V38, P447, DOI 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2011.06.01; Nazli E, 2015, J INT MED RES, V43, P217, DOI 10.1177/030006051455349; Ochoa SA, 2013, B MED HOSP INFANT M, V70, P13; Onal S, 2015, ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR, V31, P85; Pankey GA, 2005, ANTIMICROB AGENTS CH, V49, P2959, DOI 10.1128/AAC.49.7.2959-2964.200; Pitt TL, 2003, THORAX, V58, P794, DOI 10.1136/thorax.58.9.79; Sabuda DM, 2008, CAN J INFECT DIS MED, V19, P413, DOI 10.1155/2008/74319; Sueke H, 2010, INVEST OPHTH VIS SCI, V51, P4151, DOI 10.1167/iovs.09-483; TozluKeten D, 2010, ANKEM DERG, V24, P7; Tunyapanit W, 2013, SE ASIAN J TROP MED, V44, P27; Varaiya A, 2008, INDIAN J MED MICROBI, V26, P238, DOI 10.4103/0255-0857.4203; White RL, 1996, ANTIMICROB AGENTS CH, V40, P1914, DOI 10.1128/AAC.40.8.191; Yaman G, 2011, SAKARYAMJ, V3, P9; Zusman O, 2013, ANTIMICROB AGENTS CH, V57, P5104, DOI 10.1128/AAC.01230-1",27,1,1,0,4,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,4.0,,,,,1041.0,1046,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_129,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DY1XF,WOS:000384887000029,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0027892561983471073,1.347725007280145e-26,0.00947711839297653,0.05758100302776142,0.00947711839297653

The purpose of this study is to investigate the levels of Cys-C and total free thiol (TFT) in the serum and synovial liquid of patients with OA. Materials and methods: Forty OA patients, diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, and 40 healthy individuals were included in the study. In serum and fluid samples taken from patients and controls, the serum TFT levels were studied with Elman's method, and the Cys-C levels were studied with colorimetric method using commercially available kits in an autoanalyzer. Results: Cys-C levels were significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group (p<0.05), and serum TFT levels were similar between groups (p>0.05). A correlation analysis showed that the levels of serum Cys-C were positively correlated with the presence of OA (correlation coefficient = 0.300, p = 0.014) and negatively correlated with the TFT levels (correlation coefficient = -0.231, p = 0.024). In the regression analysis, it was observed that only the presence of OA independently affected the levels of Cys-C beta regression coefficient = 0.130, p = 0.024). Conclusion: In patients with OA, the level of serum Cys-C was determined to be higher than in controls. This may be related with the pathogenesis of disease, increased oxidative stress, or chronic inflammation in OA.","[Savik, Emin; Sezen, Hatice; Aksoy, Nurten] Harran Univ, Fac Med, Dept Clin Biochem, TR-63300 Sanliurfa, Turkey; [Altay, Nuray] Harran Univ, Fac Med, Dept Anesthesiol & Reanimat, TR-63300 Sanliurfa, Turkey; [Altay, Mehmet Akif; Erturk, Cemil] Harran Univ, Fac Med, Dept Orthoped Surg, TR-63300 Sanliurfa, Turkey","Sezen, H (corresponding author), Harran Univ, Fac Med, Dept Clin Biochem, Resource & Educ Hosp, Meteorol St, TR-63300 Sanliurfa, Turkey.",,"ALTAY, Mehmet Akif/AAG-2803-2021; Ertürk, Cemil/AAI-7366-2020",,,,"ABRAHAMSON M, 1986, J BIOL CHEM, V261, P128; Abramson SB, 2009, ARTHRITIS RES THER, V11, DOI 10.1186/ar265; ALTMAN R, 1986, ARTHRITIS RHEUM, V29, P1039, DOI 10.1002/art.178029081; Atukorala I, 2014, ANN RHEUM DI; BAICI A, 1995, ANN RHEUM DIS, V54, P281, DOI 10.1136/ard.54.4.28; Blagojevic M, 2010, OSTEOARTHR CARTILAGE, V18, P24, DOI 10.1016/j.joca.2009.08.01; Bossard MJ, 1996, J BIOL CHEM, V271, P12517, DOI 10.1074/jbc.271.21.1251; ELLMAN GL, 1959, ARCH BIOCHEM BIOPHYS, V82, P70, DOI 10.1016/0003-9861(59)90090-; Galasso O, 2012, ADV ORTHOP, V2012, DOI 10.1155/2012/83420; Guo H, 2012, JOINT BONE SPINE, V7; HALL A, 1995, J BIOL CHEM, V270, P5115, DOI 10.1074/jbc.270.10.511; Hootman JM, 2006, ARTHRITIS RHEUM-US, V54, P226, DOI 10.1002/art.2156; Hu PF, 2014, INT J CLIN EXP PATHO, V7, P657; Hussein MR, 2008, PATHOL ONCOL RES, V14, P321, DOI 10.1007/s12253-008-9016-; Keyszer G, 1998, ARTHRITIS RHEUM, V41, P1378, DOI 10.1002/1529-0131(199808)41:8<1378::AID-ART6>3.0.CO;2-; Kim HR, 2014, INT J RHEUM DI; Kyostio-Moore S, 2015, ARTHRITIS RES THER, V17, DOI 10.1186/s13075-015-0519-; LYNN KR, 1984, CAN J BIOCHEM CELL B, V62, P1301, DOI 10.1139/o84-16; Mehraban F, 1997, ANN RHEUM DIS, V56, P108, DOI 10.1136/ard.56.2.10; Monsouvanh A, 2014, ASIAN PAC J CANCER P, V15, P9511, DOI 10.7314/APJCP.2014.15.21.951; Nepple JJ, 2015, CLIN ORTHOP RELAT R, V473, P1683, DOI 10.1007/s11999-015-4148-; Nishiyama K, 2005, BRAIN RES BULL, V67, P94, DOI 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2005.05.02; Olszewska-Slonina D, 2015, SCAND J CLIN LAB INV, V75, P145, DOI 10.3109/00365513.2014.99294; Prasadam I, 2012, J RHEUMATOL, V39, P621, DOI 10.3899/jrheum.11077; Satkunananthan PB, 2014, OSTEOARTHR CARTILAGE, V22, P1461, DOI 10.1016/j.joca.2014.07.01; Suantawee T, 2013, J CLIN DIAGN RES, V7, P1855, DOI 10.7860/JCDR/2013/5802.333; Takahashi D, 2009, ARTHRITIS RHEUM-US, V60, P2372, DOI 10.1002/art.2471; Targonska-Stepniak B, 2011, SCAND J RHEUMATOL, V40, P341, DOI 10.3109/03009742.2011.57121; Thysen S, 2015, DIS MODEL MECH, V8, P17, DOI 10.1242/dmm.01688; Xia Hong, 2014, Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban, V39, P1151, DOI 10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2014.11.00; Yalcin S, 2013, MEDICINA-LITHUANIA, V49, P11; Zhuo Q, 2012, NAT REV RHEUMATOL, V8, P729, DOI 10.1038/nrrheum.2012.13",32,0,0,0,0,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,3.0,,,,,767.0,772,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_3_87,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DM9NQ,WOS:000376693400016,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003409090909090909,1.8798743081042226e-08,0.006600982445594492,0.12778709191957863,0.006600982445594492

Antibiotherapy must be started as early as possible since it seems to be the most important factor determining survival. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the time intervals between diagnosis and first dose of antibiotherapy and its impact on mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock patients. Materials and methods: Medical records of adult patients (>= 18 years old) admitted to medical ICU of a 1200-bed university hospital in Izmir,Turkey with the diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic shock between January 1,2010 and June 30,2014 were evaluated retrospectively. The patients admitted with other diagnosis than severe sepsis and septic shock and patients having an advanced stage of malignancy were excluded. Results: One hundred and ten patients were identified fullfilling the inclusion criteria. 49(44.5%) patients were female and 61(55.5%) were male. Average age of the patients was 74,3 +/- 11,6. Average time from diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock to first dose of antibiotherapy was identified to be 6,9 4,7 hours. Patients were classified into two groups according to application of first dose of antibiotherapy (early<3 hours vs late>3 hours). The overall mortality rate was 54.5%. Mortality rates in early group were significantly lower than late group [25%(n=5) vs 61%(n=55), p<0,05 J. Chronic renal failure was the only comorbidity significantly affecting mortality (p<0,05). Logistic regression analysis displayed early antibiotherapy (p=0,005), culture positivity (p=0,025) and APACHE II scores (p=0,006) to be important in predicting mortality. Conclusions: Time to antibiotherapy is an extremely important factor predicting mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock. Any delay in diagnosis and intense treatment including appropriate antibiotherapy should be avoided to decrease mortality rates.","[Savran, Yusuf; Duran, Yakup] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Izmir, Turkey; [Comert, Bilgin] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Med Intens Care Unit, Izmir, Turkey","Savran, Y (corresponding author), Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Med, Dept Internal Med, Mithatpasa Cad 1606 Inciralti Yerleskesi, TR-35340 Izmir, Turkey.",,"Savran, Yusuf/AAI-1796-2019; Cömert, Bilgin/P-3030-2019","Cömert, Bilgin/0000-0002-2148-5356; SAVRAN, YUSUF/0000-0002-0130-4730",,,"Alberti C, 2002, INTENS CARE MED, V28, P108, DOI 10.1007/s00134-001-1143-; Alberti C, 2003, AM J RESP CRIT CARE, V168, P77, DOI 10.1164/rccm.200208-785O; Angus D C, 2001, Crit Care Med, V29, P1303, DOI 10.1097/00003246-200107000-0000; Annane D, 2005, LANCET, V365, P63, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17667-; Annane D, 2003, AM J RESP CRIT CARE, V168, P165, DOI 10.1164/rccm.220108; Appelboam R, 2010, CRIT CARE, V14, P50, DOI DOI 10.1186/CC828; Boussekey N, 2010, CRIT CARE RES PRACT, V2010, DOI 10.1155/2010/43642; Brun-Buisson C, 2004, INTENS CARE MED, V30, P580, DOI 10.1007/s00134-003-2121-; BRUNBUISSON C, 1995, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V274, P968, DOI 10.1001/jama.274.12.96; Daniels R, 2011, EMERG MED J, V28, P507, DOI 10.1136/emj.2010.09506; Dellinger RP, 2013, INTENS CARE MED, V39, P165, DOI [10.1097/CCM.0b013e31827e83af, 10.1007/s00134-012-2769-8; Ferrer R, 2014, CRIT CARE MED, V42, P1749, DOI 10.1097/CCM.000000000000033; Gaieski DF, 2010, CRIT CARE MED, V38, P1045, DOI 10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181cc482; Gao F, 2005, CRIT CARE, V9, pR764, DOI 10.1186/cc390; Garnacho-Montero J, 2003, CRIT CARE MED, V31, P2742, DOI 10.1097/01.CCM.0000098031.24329.1; Gurnani PK, 2010, CLIN THER, V32, P1285, DOI 10.1016/j.clinthera.2010.07.00; Khwannimit B, 2009, EPIDEMIOL INFECT, V137, P1333, DOI 10.1017/S095026880900202; Kumar A, 2006, CRIT CARE MED, V34, P1589, DOI 10.1097/01.CCM.0000217961.75225.E; Levy MM, 2010, CRIT CARE MED, V38, P367, DOI 10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181cb0cd; Levy MM, 2003, CRIT CARE MED, V31, P1250, DOI 10.1097/01.CCM.0000050454.01978.3; Matot I, 2001, INTENS CARE MED, V27, pS3, DOI 10.1007/PL0000379; Morrell MR, 2009, INFECT DIS CLIN N AM, V23, P485, DOI 10.1016/j.idc.2009.04.00; Nobre V, 2007, CURR OPIN CRIT CARE, V13, P586, DOI 10.1097/MCC.0b013e3282e7d8e; Rezende E, 2008, CLINICS, V63, P457, DOI 10.1590/S1807-5932200800040000",24,3,3,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,17.0,22,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700002,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0024793388429752063,1.457924983758615e-14,0.029198644361296235,0.09401800716790179,0.030597141706883123

While 80% of the arrests occur due to cardiac pathologies, 20% occur due to non-cardiac pathologies. Determining the underlying pathology is very important. In this retrospective study, we examined the potential utilities of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in cardiac and non-cardiac arrest distinction. Materials and methods: We enrolled the following participants: 136 patients with cardiac arrests and 152 patients with noncardiac arrests between January 2012 and December 2015. The distinction was made primarily on whether cardiac pathology was present. The cardiac pathology was determined by using cardiac enzyme levels, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings, angiographic results, and patient history. Results: Cardiac arrests were observed more frequently in male patients, while the number of non-cardiac arrests was greater in female patients (p= 0.018). PLR and NLR were higher in non-cardiac arrests than in cardiac arrests (p< 0.001 for PLR and p= 0.001 for NLR). None of these parameters showed any effect on the 30-day mortality. The sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV) of the PLRs and NLRs were 80.1%, 42.2%, 64.0%, and 62.3% and 49.7%, 73.5%, 68.8%, and 55.4%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for the PLR was 61.7%, and the AUC for the NLR was 61.0%. Conclusion: We suggest that the NLR and PLR can be helpful in the differential diagnosis of cardiac and non-cardiac arrest. Thus, the NLR and PLR should be evaluated in addition to the clinical examination.","[Sen Tanrikulu, Ceren; Akilli, Nazire Belgin; Guunaydini, Yahya Kemal] Konya Training & Educ Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Konya, Turkey; [Koylu, Oznur] Konya Training & Educ Hosp, Dept Biochem, Konya, Turkey","Sen Tanrikulu, C (corresponding author), Sagik Bilimleri Univ, Konya Egitim & Arastirma Hastanesi, Saglik Bakanligi, Acil Tip Anabilim Dali, TR-42100 Meram Konya, Turkey.",,"Akilli, Nazire/AAD-9457-2020","Akilli, Nazire/0000-0001-9329-0964",,,"Alexandrakis MG, 2003, AM J CLIN ONCOL-CANC, V26, P135, DOI 10.1097/00000421-200304000-0000; Azab B, 2012, J THROMB THROMBOLYS, V34, P326, DOI 10.1007/s11239-012-0718-; Azab B, 2010, AM J CARDIOL, V106, P470, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2010.03.06; Balta S, 2014, INTERNAL MED, V53, P1239, DOI 10.2169/internalmedicine.53.178; Baskurt OK, 2003, SEMIN THROMB HEMOST, V29, P43; Celik A, 2015, KAOHSIUNG J MED SCI, V31, P145, DOI 10.1016/j.kjms.2014.12.00; CHIEN S, 1970, SCIENCE, V168, P977, DOI 10.1126/science.168.3934.97; Cho KH, 2011, AM J CARDIOL, V107, P849, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2010.10.06; Cutlip DE, 2007, CIRCULATION, V115, P2344, DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.68531; Felker GM, 2007, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V50, P40, DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2007.02.06; Fowler AJ, 2013, ATHEROSCLEROSIS, V228, P44, DOI 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2013.02.00; Furman MI, 1998, J AM COLL CARDIOL, V31, P352, DOI 10.1016/S0735-1097(97)00510-; Gawaz M, 2005, J CLIN INVEST, V115, P3378, DOI 10.1172/JCI2719; Gursoy OM, 2014, AM J CARDIOL, V113, P860, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2013.11.02; Iijima R, 2007, THROMB HAEMOSTASIS, V98, P852, DOI 10.1160/TH07-04-028; Ilhan M, 2016, J MATERN-FETAL NEO M, V29, P1476, DOI 10.3109/14767058.2015.105102; Jilma B, 1999, AM J RESP CRIT CARE, V159, P857, DOI 10.1164/ajrccm.159.3.980508; Karagoz E, 2014, NETH J MED, V72, P11; Kaya MG, 2013, INT J CARDIOL, V168, P1154, DOI 10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.11.07; Kurtipek E, 2015, J PAK MED ASSOC, V65, P128; Kwon HC, 2012, BIOMARKERS, V17, P216, DOI 10.3109/1354750X.2012.65670; Leong BSH, 2011, SINGAP MED J, V52, P57; Liu Q, 2014, PLATELETS, V25, P246, DOI 10.3109/09537104.2013.81033; Park JJ, 2013, AM J CARDIOL, V111, P636, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2012.11.01; Peerschke EI, 2010, MOL IMMUNOL, V47, P2170, DOI 10.1016/j.molimm.2010.05.00; Rubart M, 2005, J CLIN INVEST, V115, P2305, DOI 10.1172/JCI2638; Salvagno GL, 2015, CRIT REV CL LAB SCI, V52, P86, DOI 10.3109/10408363.2014.99206; Saygitov RT, 2010, EMERG MED J, V27, P105, DOI 10.1136/emj.2008.06815; Soylu K, 2014, PAK J MED SCI, V30, P936, DOI 10.12669/pjms.305.493; Suliman MARM, 2010, ARCH MED RES, V41, P618, DOI 10.1016/j.arcmed.2010.11.00; Tamhane UU, 2008, AM J CARDIOL, V102, P653, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.05.00; Tanboga IH, 2014, CLIN APPL THROMB-HEM, V20, P716, DOI 10.1177/107602961348316; Temiz A, 2014, MED SCI MONITOR, V20, P660, DOI 10.12659/MSM.89015; Uthamalingam S, 2011, AM J CARDIOL, V107, P433, DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2010.09.03; Wang D, 2013, ONCOTARGETS THER, V6, P211, DOI 10.2147/OTT.S4171; Yildiz A, 2015, CLIN APPL THROMB-HEM, V21, P223, DOI 10.1177/107602961351985; Zaman S, 2014, CIRCULATION, V129, P2426, DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.00749; Zhang SZ, 2007, CLIN CARDIOL, V30, P26, DOI 10.1002/clc.; Zheng Z.J., 2002, MMWR-MORBID MORTAL W, V51, P12",39,0,0,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_140,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000011,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0040289256198347105,5.197641457632446e-14,0.07202708867087144,0.09938296321393005,0.07604596303852901

Materials and methods: This prospective study was performed on a total of 270 participants between January 2013 and June 2014. The participants were divided into two groups: Group 1 (PAD group) included 180 patients with PAD (mean age: 55 +/- 18 years, 128 males), and Group 2 (control group) included 90 participants (mean age: 53 +/- 15 years, 61 males) with normal physical examination and arterial duplex ultrasonography findings for PAD. Groups were compared with each other according to the clinical and demographic characteristics, levels of some biochemical parameters, allele frequencies, and particularly Adducin Gly460Trp, MTHFR C677T and A1298C gene polymorphisms, which were determined by using real time polymerase chain reaction. Results: The incidences of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, family history of cardiovascular diseases and fasting glucose levels were significantly higher in PAD group. Both groups were statistically similar according to the levels of total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, urea and creatinine. Comparison of both groups according to the Adducin Gly460Trp, MTHFR C677T and A1298C gene polymorphisms, and allele frequencies did not yield any statistically significant differences. Conclusion: We concluded that Adducin Gly460Trp, MTHFR C677T and A1298C gene polymorphisms were not predictive factors for PAD.

The aim of the present study is to analyze the effects of the endurance and resistance training on IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-10 in sedentary young women. Materials and methods: Thirty female volunteer students who were overweight were chosen (BMI >= 25), and they were randomly distributed into three groups of resistance training, endurance training and control. The training groups practiced for twelve weeks and three times a week with a definite intensity and distance. IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-10, weight, fat percentage, BMI and the maximum oxygen consumption were measured before and after the twelve weeks of exercise. Results: The results showed that the endurance and resistance trainings, except for BMI have a significant effect upon the body fat percentage, VO2max, IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-10. In addition, there was not a significant difference between the effect of the resistance and endurance trainings upon the above mentioned variables. Conclusion: It seems that the endurance and resistance trainings with the significant decrease of the inflammation cytokines will decrease the chronic Non-communicable diseases in sedentary young women.","[Shahram, Soheily] Islamic Azad Univ, Shahr E Qods Branch, Dept Phys Educ & Sport Sci, Tehran, Iran; [Elham, Yadegari; Abdolali, Banaeifar] Islamic Azad Univ, South Tehran Branch, Dept Phys Educ & Sport Sci, Tehran, Iran","Shahram, S (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Shahr E Qods Branch, Dept Phys Educ & Sport Sci, Tehran, Iran.",shsohaily@gmail.com,,,"Islamic Azad University, Shahr - e - Qods Branch","The researchers hereby extend their appreciation to the Research and Technology vice chancellor of Islamic Azad University, Shahr - e - Qods Branch for sponsoring this project.","Balducci S, 2009, NUTR METAB CARDIOVAS, V20, P; Batista ML, 2010, CYTOKINE, V49, P102, DOI 10.1016/j.cyto.2009.10.00; Beavers KM, 2010, CLIN CHIM ACTA, V411, P785, DOI 10.1016/j.cca.2010.02.06; Bruunsgaard H, 2005, J LEUKOCYTE BIOL, V78, P819, DOI 10.1189/jlb.050524; Daar AS, 2007, NATURE, V450, P494, DOI 10.1038/450494; Das UN, 2004, NUTRITION, V20, P323, DOI 10.1016/j.nut.2003.11.01; Haghighi AH, 2006, OLYMPIC, V14, P1; Huffman KM, 2008, METABOLISM, V57, P577, DOI 10.1016/j.metabol.2007.11.02; Jung SH, 2008, J NUTR BIOCHEM, V19, P371, DOI 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2007.05.00; Kadoglou NPE, 2007, EUR J CARDIOV PREV R, V14, P837, DOI 10.1097/HJR.0b013e3282efaf5; Kadoglou NPE, 2010, METABOLISM, V59, P599, DOI 10.1016/j.metabol.2009.09.00; Kohut ML, 2006, BRAIN BEHAV IMMUN, V20, P201, DOI 10.1016/j.bbi.2005.12.00; Lira FS, 2009, CELL BIOCHEM FUNCT, V27, P458, DOI 10.1002/cbf.159; Mathur N, 2008, MEDIAT INFLAMM, V2008, DOI 10.1155/2008/10950; Nicklas BJ, 2004, AM J CLIN NUTR, V79, P54; Nikseresht M, 2014, J STRENGTH COND RES, V28, P2560, DOI 10.1519/JSC.000000000000044; Pedersen Bente Klarlund, 2011, J Exp Biol, V214, P337, DOI 10.1242/jeb.04807; Petersen AMW, 2005, J APPL PHYSIOL, V98, P1154, DOI 10.1152/japplphysiol.00164.200; Prestes J, 2009, J SPORT SCI, V27, P1607, DOI 10.1080/0264041090335292; Pretolani M, 1999, CLIN EXP ALLERGY, V29, P1164, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2222.1999.00456.; Radom-Aizik S, 2007, CYTOKINE, V40, P75, DOI 10.1016/j.cyto.2007.08.00; Rall LC, 2000, J NUTR BIOCHEM, V11, P581, DOI 10.1016/S0955-2863(00)00123-",22,3,4,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,,,,2.0,,999.0,1002,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SU,WOS:000390175400025,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0022727272727272726,2.5987903468105105e-11,0.004334360236312917,0.10349952420156747,0.004334360236312917

Aim of our study is to compare the effect of patients with local advanced or metastatic SQCLC, in comparable groups of patients treated with systemic chemotherapy containing gemcitabine/cisplatin (GP) or GP+ Endostar. Materials and methods: All patients with local advanced or metastatic SQCLC who had undergone GP+ continuous administration of Endostar from September 2009 to January 2014 were evaluated. The GP group was constituted by selecting patients with local advanced or metastatic SQCLC treated with GP chemotherapy during the same period. Results: Fifty-two patients were retrospectively included in the GP group and were compared with 98 patients who had undergone continuous administration of Endostar +GP and were evaluated prospectively. All characteristics were comparable. Median follow-up was 60 months in the GP group versus 58 months in the Endostar +GP group. The response rate (RR) was 34.7% in Endostar +GP group and 34.6% in the GP group. The disease control rate (DCR) was 89.7% in Endostar +GP group and 80.8% in the GP group. Both the RR and DCR were not found to be significantly different with each other. Median progression free survival (PFS) was 5.56 months in the GP group versus 7.23 months in the Endostar +GP group. Discussion: The combination of continuous infusion of Endostar with chemotherapy can improve the PFS in local advanced or metastatic SQCLC patients without increasing adverse events.","[Shen, Hong; Zhao, Jing; Weng, Shan-Shan; Fang, Xue-Feng; Huang, Jian-Jin] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Hosp 2, Dept Med Oncol, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yi-Yang] Hangzhou Sanat Peoples Liberat Army, Dept Med Ctr, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Huang, JJ (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Sch Med, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Med Oncol, 88 Jiefang Rd, Hangzhou 310009, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [81201640]; Department of Education of Zhejiang Province of China [Y201225802]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [Y16H160082]; Medical and Technology Plan of Zhejiang Province of China [2013KYA093],"The present study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81201640), the Department of Education of Zhejiang Province of China (No. Y201225802), Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Y16H160082) and the Medical and Technology Plan of Zhejiang Province of China (No. 2013KYA093)","Bao Y, 2015, RADIOTHER ONCOL, V114, P161, DOI 10.1016/j.radonc.2014.11.03; Boehm T, 1997, NATURE, V390, P404, DOI 10.1038/3712; Cirillo M, 2009, ANN ONCOL, V20, P1929, DOI 10.1093/annonc/mdp28; Eisenhauer EA, 2009, EUR J CANCER, V45, P228, DOI 10.1016/j.ejca.2008.10.02; Fossella F, 2003, J CLIN ONCOL, V21, P3016, DOI 10.1200/JCO.2003.12.04; Gazdar AF, 2009, ONCOGENE, V28, pS24, DOI 10.1038/onc.2009.19; Goss GD, 2010, J CLIN ONCOL, V28, P49, DOI 10.1200/JCO.2009.22.942; Govindan R, 2006, J CLIN ONCOL, V24, P4539, DOI 10.1200/JCO.2005.04.485; Hainsworth JD, 2011, J THORAC ONCOL, V6, P109, DOI 10.1097/JTO.0b013e3181f94ad; Han BH, 2011, J THORAC ONCOL, V6, P1104, DOI 10.1097/JTO.0b013e3182166b6; Hansma AHG, 2005, ANN ONCOL, V16, P1695, DOI 10.1093/annonc/mdi31; Jia HP, 2006, NAT BIOTECHNOL, V24, P117, DOI 10.1038/nbt0206-11; Jiang X, 2015, CELL BIOCHEM BIOPHYS, V71, P571, DOI 10.1007/s12013-014-0236-; Johnson DH, 2004, J CLIN ONCOL, V22, P2184, DOI 10.1200/JCO.2004.11.02; Kelly K, 2001, J CLIN ONCOL, V19, P3210, DOI 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.13.321; Kisker O, 2001, CANCER RES, V61, P766; Kuroiwa M, 2003, J PEDIATR SURG, V38, P1499, DOI 10.1016/S0022-3468(03)00503-; Langer CJ, 2010, J CLIN ONCOL, V28, P5311, DOI 10.1200/JCO.2010.28.812; Novello Silvia, 2003, Oncology (Williston Park), V17, P35; Rong BX, 2012, WORLD J SURG ONCOL, V10, DOI 10.1186/1477-7819-10-17; Sakurai H, 2010, J THORAC ONCOL, V5, P1594, DOI 10.1097/JTO.0b013e3181f1923; Scagliotti G, 2010, J CLIN ONCOL, V28, P1835, DOI 10.1200/JCO.2009.26.132; Scagliotti GV, 2012, J CLIN ONCOL, V30, P2829, DOI 10.1200/JCO.2011.41.498; Scagliotti GV, 2008, J CLIN ONCOL, V26, P3543, DOI 10.1200/JCO.2007.15.037; Scagliotti GV, 2002, J CLIN ONCOL, V20, P4285, DOI 10.1200/JCO.2002.02.06; Schiller JH, 2002, NEW ENGL J MED, V346, P92, DOI 10.1056/NEJMoa01195; Wang J, 2010, J CLIN ONCOL, V28, DOI 10.1200/jco.2010.28.15_suppl.759; Wang Jinwan, 2005, Zhongguo Fei Ai Za Zhi, V8, P283, DOI 10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2005.04.0; Zhao X, 2012, INVEST NEW DRUG, V30, P1144, DOI 10.1007/s10637-011-9631-",29,5,5,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,57.0,62,,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700008,,,,,2022-07-14,0.002995867768595041,2.9331146541885275e-21,0.005777055036933499,0.0650035255011248,0.005777055036933499

This study want to survey the potential of Tobit regression as a tool to study risk factors of time to onset of CMV in kidney transplant recipients. Materials and methods: 242 kidney transplant recipients from 2010 to 2015 in Shahid Beheshti hospital, Babol, Iran entered to the retrospective cohort study. All patients' clinical and demographic characteristics were analyzed as risk factors. The response variable was the time to onset of CMV infection and Tobit model was used to evaluate the factors affecting it. Results: Evaluating the time to incidence of CMV infection in recipients of renal transplants with Tobit regression, revealed that age at the time of transplantation (p=0.01), hypertension (p=0.05), etiology of urologic disease (p=0.02) have a significant relationship with the period of time to onset of CMV infection after renal transplantation. Conclusion: As a results in this study, the time to onset of CMV is influenced by the age of patients. So, the more the age is, the less period of time is to onset of CMV infection. This time will be shorter with hypertension and etiology of urologic diseases for ESRD in these patients.","[Shirafkan, Hoda] Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Dept Biostat, Sari, Iran; [Yazdani-Charati, Jamshid] Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Dept Biostat, Hlth Sci Res Ctr, Fac Hlth, Sari, Iran; [Mozaffarpur, Seyyed Ali] Babol Univ Med Sci, Res Ctr Tradit Med & Hist Med Sci, Babol Sar, Iran; [Khafri, Soraya] Babol Univ Med Sci, Dept Social Med, Babol Sar, Iran; [Akbari, Roghaye] Babol Univ Med Sci, Dept Internal Med, Babol Sar, Iran; [Pasha, Abazar Akbarzadeh] Babol Univ Med Sci, Dept Kidney & Urinary Tract Surg, Babol Sar, Iran","Yazdani-Charati, J (corresponding author), Mazandaran Univ Med Sci, Dept Biostat, Hlth Sci Res Ctr, Fac Hlth, Sari, Iran.",Jamshid.charati@gmail.com,"Khafri, Soraya/N-5630-2017; Khafri, Abolfazl/H-3772-2017; Shirafkan, Hoda/AAE-8403-2020; Mozaffarpur, Seyyedali/AEF-6020-2022; mozaffarpur, seyyedali/R-3599-2016","Shirafkan, Hoda/0000-0002-5682-1153; khafri, soraya/0000-0002-2398-7560; Mozaffarpur, Seyyed Ali/0000-0002-8138-6229",,,"Abedi G, 2012, INT J COLLAB RES INT, V4, P10; AMEMIYA T, 1984, J ECONOMETRICS, V24, P3, DOI 10.1016/0304-4076(84)90074-; Anastasopoulos PC, 2008, ACCIDENT ANAL PREV, V40, P768, DOI 10.1016/j.aap.2007.09.00; Bal Z, 2013, TRANSPLANTATION ; Brennan DC, 2001, J AM SOC NEPHROL, V12, P848, DOI 10.1681/ASN.V12484; Chiasakul T, 2015, TRANSPLANTATION ; Cordero E, 2012, TRANSPLANTATION ; Diaz J, 2014, TRANSPLANTATION ; Ekstrand C, 1998, PREV VET MED, V37, P219, DOI 10.1016/S0167-5877(98)00090-; Erdbruegger U, 2012, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V27, P435, DOI 10.1093/ndt/gfr30; Falahi S, 2009, IRANIAN J MED MICROB, V3, P6; FORMAN SJ, 1994, BLOOD, V83, P239; Hartmann A, 2006, TRANSPLANTATION, V82, pS15, DOI 10.1097/01.tp.0000230460.42558.b; Helantera I, 2009, NEPHROL DIAL TRANSPL, V24, P316, DOI 10.1093/ndt/gfn55; Jahromi V.

Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a common side effect of cancer therapy that can have an impact on quality of life and survivorship. PN may happen in MM due to adverse effect of chemotherapeutics, amyloidosis or as a part of paraneoplastic syndrome. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in multiple myeloma patients and its association with age and disease outcome. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 92 multiple myeloma patients who presented to hematology clinic between 2009 and 2014. Their age, gender, performance status, chemotherapeutic regimens, stage of disease, diabetes status and electromyography results were noted. An association between clinical parameters and neuropathy was analyzed. Kaplan Meier analysis was used in statistical comparisons between mortality and other parameters. Results: The mean age of patients was 64 +/- 11.6. Patients with neuropathy were enrolled as group 1 (27.2%) and patients without neuropathy were enrolled as group 2 (72.8%). No significant association was found between age and peripheral neuropathy (p=1.00). The estimated median survival time was 27 months in patients with PN, whereas 56 months in patients without PN (p=0.273). In group 1 three year overall survival rate was 41% whereas in group 2 it was 57%. Conclusion: It is important to understand pathophysiology of PN and recognize who is at risk since; it is a common side effect of MM treatment. This study is among the few analyses evaluating prevalence of peripheral neuropathy confirmed with electromyography in MM patients. There was no significant association between increased age, survival and neuropathy. Evaluating other associations and understanding potential risks with further research may guide us in developing better preventive and treatment modalities for PN in older MM patients.","[Silay, Kamile] Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Fac Med, Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Internal Med & Geriatr, Ankara, Turkey; [Akinci, Sema; Guney, Tekin] Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Hematol, Ankara, Turkey; [Ulas, Arife] Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Ankara, Turkey; [Yalcin, Ahmet] Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Geriatr, Ankara, Turkey; [Dilek, Imdat] Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Fac Med, Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Hematol, Ankara, Turkey","Silay, K (corresponding author), Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Fac Med, Ataturk Training & Res Hosp, Dept Internal Med & Geriatr, Ankara, Turkey.",,"Yalcin, Ahmet/AAA-9697-2020","Yalcin, Ahmet/0000-0001-9472-2212",,,"Argyriou AA, 2006, SUPPORT CARE CANCER, V14, P223, DOI 10.1007/s00520-005-0868-; Argyriou AA, 2008, BLOOD, V112, P1593, DOI 10.1182/blood-2008-04-14938; Argyriou AA, 2012, CRIT REV ONCOL HEMAT, V82, P51, DOI 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2011.04.01; Badros A, 2007, CANCER-AM CANCER SOC, V110, P1042, DOI 10.1002/cncr.2292; Blade J, 1998, LEUKEMIA LYMPHOMA, V30, P493, DOI 10.3109/1042819980905756; Broyl A, 2010, LANCET ONCOL, V11, P1057, DOI 10.1016/S1470-2045(10)70206-; Cavo M, 2012, BLOOD, V120, P9, DOI 10.1182/blood-2012-02-40889; Delforge M, 2010, LANCET ONCOL, V11, P1086, DOI 10.1016/S1470-2045(10)70068-; Facon T, 2007, LANCET, V370, P1209, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61537-; Hulin C, 2009, J CLIN ONCOL, V27, P3664, DOI 10.1200/JCO.2008.21.094; Ja'afer FMH, 2006, EXP BRAIN RES, V173, P334, DOI 10.1007/s00221-006-0499-; Jagannath S, 2005, BRIT J HAEMATOL, V129, P776, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05540.; Kaufmann H, 2004, BLOOD, V104, P2269, DOI 10.1182/blood-2004-03-109; Kyle RA, 2003, MAYO CLIN PROC, V78, P21, DOI 10.4065/78.1.2; Lanzani F, 2008, J PERIPHER NERV SYST, V13, P267, DOI 10.1111/j.1529-8027.2008.00192.; Palumbo A, 2011, BLOOD, V118, P4519, DOI 10.1182/blood-2011-06-35881; Raab MS, 2009, LANCET, V374, P324, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60221-; Rajkumar SV, 2008, J CLIN ONCOL, V26, P2171, DOI 10.1200/JCO.2007.14.185; Richardson PG, 2012, LEUKEMIA, V26, P595, DOI 10.1038/leu.2011.34; Richardson PG, 2006, J CLIN ONCOL, V24, P3113, DOI 10.1200/JCO.2005.04.777; Richardson PG, 2010, BLOOD, V116, P679, DOI 10.1182/blood-2010-02-26886; Siegel R, 2014, CA-CANCER J CLIN, V64, P9, DOI [10.3322/caac.21254, 10.1001/jamaoto.2014.2530, 10.3322/caac.21208, 10.1136/bmj.g1502; Velasco R, 2010, J PERIPHER NERV SYST, V15, P17, DOI 10.1111/j.1529-8027.2010.00248.; Windebank AJ, 2008, J PERIPHER NERV SYST, V13, P27, DOI 10.1111/j.1529-8027.2008.00156.",24,1,1,0,5,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,123.0,126,,,,4,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700019,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0024793388429752063,4.688926279131009e-18,0.0047466654826543615,0.07459868527523678,0.0047466654826543615

Because of steadily expanding ascend in death rate, the earnest need is to discover novel prognostic biomarkers. In this attempt, inflammation has been a prominent target because of its importance in the development and behavior of atherosclerotic plaques. The current article came up from the recent suggestions by the scientific community on the role of neutrophils to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as an inflammatory predictive biomarker of cardiovascular events at an early stage. Materials and methods: Blood samples were collected from 100 chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) patients who have visited the outpatient department (OPD) at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and 100 healthy control individuals. Complete blood examination was done on Cell-Dyn Ruby, USA to calculate NLR. In addition, lipid profile, platelet counts, red cell distribution width (RDW), C-reactive proteins (CRP), fasting glucose, insulin and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were also measured by various procedures on different instruments. Results: Total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) showed a significant rise of around 13%. However, non-highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (Non-HDL) level showed a similar decline (P< 0.05) compared with control. A remarkable rise in fasting glucose, Hb1Ac, and insulin by 58%, 53%, and 44% was recorded in CAD group. Moreover, CRP level also showed a significant rise of 39% in CAD group compared with control individuals. The white blood cell (WBC) analysis revealed a significant enhancement in total WBC, neutrophils and lymphocytes counts. The calculated NLR was found to be significantly (P< 0.001) elevated by 110% in CAD patients compared with control individuals. Conclusions: In view of significant enhancement of NLR level in our samples, we recommend its use as a predictive biomarker of CAD because it is a simple and inexpensive method and could be performed in a routine blood sample.","[Tabrez, Shams; Jabir, Nasimudeen R.; Firoz, Chelapram K.] King Abdulaziz Univ, King Fahd Med Res Ctr, POB 80216, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Nabilalama, Mohammed] King Abdulaziz Univ Hosp, Dept Med, Cardiol Unit, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia","Tabrez, S (corresponding author), King Abdulaziz Univ, King Fahd Med Res Ctr, POB 80216, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.",,"Tabrez, Shams/H-9476-2012; Rehumathbeevi, Jabir Nasimudeen/H-9483-2012; Tabrez, Shams/H-7315-2019; KANDY, FIROZ CHELAPRAM/H-9487-2012","Tabrez, Shams/0000-0003-4550-415X; Rehumathbeevi, Jabir Nasimudeen/0000-0001-8548-7986; Tabrez, Shams/0000-0003-4550-415X; KANDY, FIROZ CHELAPRAM/0000-0002-8832-9411","Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah [141 - 912 - D1435]; DSR","This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, under grant No. (141 - 912 - D1435).

Although mortality risk factors have been investigated in previous studies, there is not sufficient data about the prognostic roles of tracheostomy and central venous catheterization (CVC) in patients with AB bacteremia. Therefore, we performed this study to assess the risk factors associated to mortality from AB bacteremia in intensive care unit (ICU) with a new perspective. Materials and methods: Data of 90 adult patients with AB bacteremia hospitalized between 01 January 2010 and 01 December 2014 in ICU were evaluated retrospectively. The results were assessed in terms of 14th and 28th day mortality rates. Results: The 14th day and 28th day mortality rates for patients with AB bacteremia were 31.1 % and 48.9 %, respectively. The 14th day non-survivors were more likely to have chronic kidney disease, insertion of subclavian and femoral CVC compared to survivors. While tracheostomy, jugular CVC, absence of CVC, higher serum albumin and lower procalcitonin (PCT) levels were observed significantly more common in survivors; higher high-sensitivity CRP, higher PCT, and lower albumin levels were significantly more common in mortality group. Risk factors associated with 14th day mortality were high serum PCT (p<0.001), lack of tracheostomy (p=0.004) and CVC location (p=0.007). Whereas, 28th day mortality was associated with chronic kidney disease, malignancy, insertion of subclavian and femoral CVC. High serum PCT (p<0.001), lack of tracheostomy (p=0.001) and CVC location (p=0.006) were determined as independent predictors for 28th day mortality. Conclusion: These data reveal that lack of tracheostomy and presence of subclavian or femoral CVC are independent risk factors for 14th and 28th day mortality, and high PCT level is a good predictor for poor prognosis in ICU patients with AB bacteremia. According to our knowledge, this study contributes to current literature in terms of being the first study focused on the prognostic roles of tracheostomy and CVC in patients with AB bacteremia.","[Taskin, Gurhan; Ocal, Nesrin; Ozer, Serhat; Yamanel, Levent] Gulhane Mil Med Fac, Dept Intens Care, Ankara, Turkey; [Ozturk, Kadir] Gulhane Mil Med Fac, Dept Gastroenterol, Ankara, Turkey; [Turker, Turker] Gulhane Mil Med Fac, Dept Hlth Publ & Epidemiol, Ankara, Turkey; [Cakar, Mustafa] Gulhane Mil Med Fac, Dept Rheumatol, Ankara, Turkey","Taskin, G (corresponding author), Gulhane Mil Med Fac, Dept Intens Care, Ankara, Turkey.;Taskin, G (corresponding author), Gulhane Askeri Tip Akad, TR-06010 Ankara, Turkey.",,"Taskin, Gurhan/AGQ-8182-2022; ocal, nesrin/D-4118-2016",,,,"Arora S, 2015, SHOCK, V43, P212, DOI 10.1097/SHK.000000000000030; Choi JY, 2005, INTERN MED J, V35, P599, DOI 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2005.00925.; Costello SE, 2016, MICROB DRUG RESIST, V22, P253, DOI 10.1089/mdr.2015.016; Ellis D, 2015, ANTIMICROB RESIST IN, V4, DOI 10.1186/s13756-015-0083-; Garcia-Garmendia JL, 1999, CRIT CARE MED, V27, P1794, DOI 10.1097/00003246-199909000-0001; Georgopoulou AP, 2011, J CRIT CARE, V26, DOI 10.1016/j.jcrc.2010.07.01; Huang ST, 2012, J MICROBIOL IMMUNOL, V45, P356, DOI 10.1016/j.jmii.2011.12.00; Jung JY, 2010, BMC INFECT DIS, V10, DOI 10.1186/1471-2334-10-22; Karageorgopoulos DE, 2008, LANCET INFECT DIS, V8, P751, DOI 10.1016/S1473-3099(08)70279-; Katsaragakis S, 2010, AM J INFECT CONTROL, V38, P631, DOI 10.1016/j.ajic.2010.01.00; Le Hello S, 2010, SCAND J INFECT DIS, V42, P821, DOI 10.3109/00365548.2010.49608; Liu C, 2014, INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRONIC AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING (CEEE 2014), P; Maragakis LL, 2008, CLIN INFECT DIS, V46, P1254, DOI 10.1086/52919; Marik PE, 2012, CRIT CARE MED, V40, P2479, DOI 10.1097/CCM.0b013e318255d9b; Park SY, 2013, INFECT CHEMOTHER, V45, P325, DOI 10.3947/ic.2013.45.3.32; Reinert RR, 2007, J ANTIMICROB CHEMOTH, V60, P1018, DOI 10.1093/jac/dkm31; Routsi C, 2010, INFECTION, V38, P173, DOI 10.1007/s15010-010-0008-; Saravu K, 2015, PATHOG GLOB HEALTH, V109, P228, DOI 10.1179/2047773215Y.000000002; Schroeder S, 2009, LANGENBECK ARCH SURG, V394, P221, DOI 10.1007/s00423-008-0432-; Schuetz P, 2013, CRIT CARE, V17, DOI 10.1186/cc1278; Schuetz P, 2011, ARCH INTERN MED, V171, P1322, DOI 10.1001/archinternmed.2011.31; Schuetz P, 2009, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V302, P1059, DOI 10.1001/jama.2009.129; Sheng WH, 2010, INT J INFECT DIS, V14, pE764, DOI 10.1016/j.ijid.2010.02.225; Sunenshine RH, 2007, EMERG INFECT DIS, V13, P97, DOI 10.3201/eid1301.06071; Szakmany T, 2015, BRIT J ANAESTH, V114, P396, DOI 10.1093/bja/aeu44; VANHOLDER R, 1993, J AM SOC NEPHROL, V3, P154",26,1,1,0,3,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1891.0,1897,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_179,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300023,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0026859504132231405,1.7178392618532554e-20,0.01988583531356545,0.07453664846884168,0.01988583531356545

In this study, the role of this drug on apoptosis in rat spermatozoa was investigated along with the effectiveness of two herbal antioxidants of vitamin C (VC) and menthone in the prevention of ACV adverse effects was compared. Materials and methods: Albino Wister adult male rats with mean weight of 200-250 g were divided randomly into six groups. Treatment groups consisted of acyclovir (ACV) at the dose of 15mg/kg/d, ACV (15mg/kg/d) and VC at the dose of 20mg/kg/d, ACV (15mg/kg/d) and menthone at the dose of 100 mu l/d, ACV (15mg/kg/d) and menthone at the dose of250 mu l/d, ACV (15mg/kg/d) and menthone at the dose of 400 mu l/d and control group ended the trial period without any treatment. The animals were anesthetized and epididymal sperm cells from each rats were isolated in PBS to evaluate the expression of caspase3 enzyme by flow cytometry method. Results: The present results demonstrated a very strong supportive, protective effect along with impressive anti-apoptotic role of VC. The expression level of caspase 3 in VC receiving group was close to normal levels. Menthone, another antioxidant compound in the high dose level showed to have a strong anti-apoptotic power, against changes induced by ACV.","[Toghiani, Shima; Roudbari, Nasim Hayati] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Biol, Tehran, Iran; [Dashti, Gholam Reza] Isfahan Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Dept Anat Sci, Esfahan, Iran; [Roozbehani, Shahla] Islamic Azad Univ, Falavarjan Branch, Dept Biol, Esfahan, Iran","Dashti, GR (corresponding author), Isfahan Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Dept Anat Sci, Esfahan, Iran.",dashti@med.mui.ac.ir,"dashti, Gholam reza/R-8062-2017; dashti, gholam/AAR-5400-2020","dashti, Gholam reza/0000-0002-2725-6423; ","Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran","This work was funded by Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.

Chronic viral hepatitis D continues to be a significant health problem in certain regions of the world. Rates of response to currently proposed treatments are rather low. The aim of this study was to investigate oxidative stress in patients with chronic viral hepatitis D. Materials and methods: A total of 91 patients with chronic hepatitis D virus infection were included in this study (mean age: 42.2 +/- 11.7). In addition, 40 healthy volunteers were included in the study to form the control group. Patients were divided into two main sub-groups as cirrhotic (n=30) and non-cirrhotic (n=61) groups. Blood samples were taken from both patients and control subjects and compared for total oxidant status (TOS), total anti-oxidant status (TAS) and oxidative stress index (OSI). Results: TOS levels were significantly higher in the patients compared to the control sub-jects (p<0.001). Moreover, TOS levels were higher in the cirrhotic patients compared to the non-cirrhotic patients (p=0.006). TAS levels were significantly lower in the patients compared to the control subjects (p=0.003). OSI levels were significantly higher in the patients compared to the control subjects (p<0.001). Moreover, OSI levels were higher in the cirrhotic patients compared to the non-cirrhotic patients (p<0.05). Conclusion: These results are supportive of the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of chronic viral hepatitis D. Antioxidant therapies might be considered in patients with chronic viral hepatitis D considering the presence of oxidative stress in these patients.","[Ucmak, Feyzullah; Ekin, Nazim; Tuncel, Elif Tugba; Yalcin, Kendal] Dicle Univ, Sch Med, Dept Gastroenterol, TR-21100 Diyarbakir, Turkey; [Solmaz, Ihsan] Siverek State Hosp, Internal Med Clin, Sanliurfa, Turkey; [Kaplan, Ibrahim] Dicle Univ, Sch Med, Dept Clin Biochem, Diyarbakir, Turkey; [Senates, Ebubekir] Medeniyet Univ, Sch Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Istanbul, Turkey","Ucmak, F (corresponding author), Dicle Univ, Sch Med, Dept Gastroenterol, TR-21100 Diyarbakir, Turkey.",,,,,,"Alves C, 2013, ADV VIROL, V2013, DOI 10.1155/2013/56010; Bolukbas C, 2005, BMC INFECT DIS, V5, DOI 10.1186/1471-2334-5-9; Chiou YL, 2012, CLIN BIOCHEM, V45, P1389, DOI 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.06.02; Cichoz-Lach H, 2014, WORLD J GASTROENTERO, V20, P8082, DOI 10.3748/wjg.v20.i25.808; Dikici I, 2005, CLIN BIOCHEM, V38, P1141, DOI 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2005.10.00; Duygu F, 2012, ANN LAB MED, V32, P113, DOI 10.3343/alm.2012.32.2.11; Erel O, 2004, CLIN BIOCHEM, V37, P277, DOI 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2003.11.01; Erel O, 2005, CLIN BIOCHEM, V38, P1103, DOI 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2005.08.00; Ha HL, 2010, WORLD J GASTROENTERO, V16, P6035, DOI 10.3748/wjg.v16.i48.603; Heidrich B, 2012, LIVER INT, V32, P1415, DOI 10.1111/j.1478-3231.2012.02831.; Higgs MR, 2014, J GEN VIROL, V95, P991, DOI 10.1099/vir.0.059485-; ISHAK K, 1995, J HEPATOL, V22, P696, DOI 10.1016/0168-8278(95)80226-; Jaeschke H, 2011, J GASTROEN HEPATOL, V26, P173, DOI 10.1111/j.1440-1746.2010.06592.; Koruk M, 2004, ANN CLIN LAB SCI, V34, P5; Levent G, 2006, J TRANSL MED, V4, DOI 10.1186/1479-5876-4-2; Look MP, 1999, ANTIVIR RES, V43, P113, DOI 10.1016/S0166-3542(99)00041-; Muriel P, 2009, HEPATOL INT, V3, P526, DOI 10.1007/s12072-009-9158-; Namiduru ES, 2012, ADV CLIN EXP MED, V21, P4; Pascarella S, 2011, LIVER INT, V31, P7, DOI 10.1111/j.1478-3231.2010.02320.; Pijls KE, 2013, LIVER INT, V33, P1457, DOI 10.1111/liv.1227; Rizzetto M, 2015, HEPATOLOGY, V61, P1109, DOI 10.1002/hep.2758; Sanchez-Valle V, 2012, CURR MED CHEM, V19, P4850, DOI 10.2174/09298671280334152; SMEDILE A, 1982, LANCET, V2, P945, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(82)90156-; Takaki A, 2015, WORLD J HEPATOL, V7, P968, DOI 10.4254/wjh.v7.i7.96; Takaki A, 2014, INT J MOL SCI, V15, P7352, DOI 10.3390/ijms1505735; Torres JR, 1996, GUT, V38, pS48, DOI 10.1136/gut.38.Suppl_2.S4; Uhl P, 2014, INT J MOL SCI, V15, P7500, DOI 10.3390/ijms1505750; Wedemeyer H, 2010, NAT REV GASTRO HEPAT, V7, P31, DOI 10.1038/nrgastro.2009.20; Williams V, 2012, J VIRAL HEPATITIS, V19, P744, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2893.2012.01597.; Yurdaydin C, 2010, J VIRAL HEPATITIS, V17, P749, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2893.2010.01353.; Zuwala-Jagiello J, 2009, ACTA BIOCHIM POL, V56, P67",31,0,0,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,6.0,,,,,1865.0,1871,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_6_175,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2SJ,WOS:000390174300019,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003202479338842975,1.202213644589806e-11,0.04753723839660826,0.10347739638898094,0.04755797106399165

Although multiple agents have been used to minimize this pathology, I/R injury remains a challenging problem. In this study, we investigated the effectivity of escin on hepatic I/R injury. Materials and methods: Hepatic I/R injury was determined in rats by the clamping of the hepatic artery and portal vein for 60 minutes, followed by 60-minute reperfusion. Escin 10 mg/kg (i.p.) was administered 30 minutes prior to ischemia and 30 minutes prior to reperfusion. Liver function tests were evaluated by the assessment of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, the radical oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated by the assessment of malondialdehyde (MDA), and the antioxidant activity was evaluated by the assessment of glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Samples of liver tissues were histopathologically evaluated. Results: The results revealed that serum AST, ALT, and LDH and the MDA levels were lower both in the pre-ischemia and pre-reperfusion escin groups. The CAT and SOD levels were higher in the pre-reperfusion escin group. Histopathologic injury was lower in the rats administered with escin. Discussion: In this study, it was demonstrated that escin provides useful outcomes since it reduces ROS formation when administered prior to ischemia and removes ROS when administered prior to reperfusion.","[Ugras, Daban; Mustafa, Ugur; Seckin, Akkucuk; Gazi, Ozbilen Orhan; Cem, Oruc; Erol, Kilic; Akin, Aydogan] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Sch Med, Dept Gen Surg, TR-31100 Serinyol, Hatay, Turkey; [Oguzhan, Ozcan] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem, TR-31100 Serinyol, Hatay, Turkey; [Mehmet, Yaldiz] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, TR-31100 Serinyol, Hatay, Turkey","Mustafa, U (corresponding author), Mustafa Kemal Univ, Tip Fak, Genel Cerrahi AD, TR-31100 Serinyol, Hatay, Turkey.",,,,Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of Mustafa Kemal University,This study was granted by Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of Mustafa Kemal University.,"Aebi H., 1974, METHODS ENZYMATIC AN, P67; Atila K, 2002, CLIN NUTR, V21, P309, DOI 10.1054/clnu.2002.054; Bilbao G, 1999, ANN SURG, V230, P185, DOI 10.1097/00000658-199908000-0000; Bougelet C, 1998, EUR J PHARMACOL, V345, P89, DOI 10.1016/S0014-2999(97)01616-; Crockett ET, 2006, BMC CLIN PATHOL, V6, DOI 10.1186/1472-6890-6-; DAWSON TL, 1993, AM J PHYSIOL, V264, pC961, DOI 10.1152/ajpcell.1993.264.4.C96; DRAPER HH, 1990, METHOD ENZYMOL, V186, P42; Dufour DR, 2000, CLIN CHEM, V46, P202; DURAK I, 1993, CLIN CHIM ACTA, V214, P103, DOI 10.1016/0009-8981(93)90307-; GUILLAUME M, 1994, ARZNEIMITTELFORSCH, V44-1, P2; HORTON JW, 1993, J APPL PHYSIOL, V74, P1515, DOI 10.1152/jappl.1993.74.4.151; JENNINGS RB, 1991, ANNU REV MED, V42, P225, DOI 10.1146/annurev.med.42.1.22; Kahraman A, 2003, J NEPHROL, V16, P21; KNIGHT KR, 1991, CLIN SCI, V80, P235, DOI 10.1042/cs080023; KOBAYASHI S, 1989, J BIOL CHEM, V264, P1799; Kucukkurt I, 2010, J ETHNOPHARMACOL, V129, P18, DOI 10.1016/j.jep.2010.02.01; Mandrekar P, 2011, MOL PATHOL LIB, V5, P411, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-7107-4_2; MORRIS SF, 1993, PLAST RECONSTR SURG, V92, P1162, DOI 10.1097/00006534-199311000-0002; Nath KA, 1994, AM J MED, V42, P63; Onody P, 2013, PLOS ONE, V8, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.007375; PAGLIA DE, 1967, J LAB CLIN MED, V70, P15; Seeto RK, 2000, AM J MED, V109, P109, DOI 10.1016/S0002-9343(00)00461-; Sehirli O, 2008, PHYTOTHER RES, V22, P43, DOI 10.1002/ptr.225; Serracino-Inglott Ferdinand, 2002, BMC Gastroenterol, V2, P22, DOI 10.1186/1471-230X-2-2; Siemionow M, 2004, MICROSURG, V24, P468, DOI 10.1002/micr.2006; Sirtori CR, 2001, PHARMACOL RES, V44, P183, DOI 10.1006/phrs.2001.084; Sozen S, 2011, HIPPOKRATIA, V15, P16; SUN Y, 1988, CLIN CHEM, V34, P49; Wilhelm J, 1990, Acta Univ Carol Med Monogr, V137, P; Yildirim Sadik, 2002, Asian J Surg, V25, P149, DOI 10.1016/S1015-9584(09)60164-; Yining L, 2015, BIOMEDICAL REPORTS, P1; Zhang QQ, 2013, PLOS ONE, V8, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.007442",32,2,2,1,8,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,4.0,,,,,973.0,979,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_4_118,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DY1XF,WOS:000384887000018,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003305785123966942,6.062013100810895e-21,0.006257320027994382,0.06447272896810331,0.006257320027994382

Materials and methods: Alcohol and drug abuse groups constituted of male abusers who presented to a local Alcohol and Drug Abuse Research Center. Control groups were composed of age-matched healthy men who denied any drug/alcohol abuse. Each group was composed of 30 men. Beck Depression and Anxiety Scales, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OAB-V8), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) and sexual satisfaction scale were the tools applied to the subjects and controls. Additionally, maximum (Qmax) and average urinary flow rates (Qave) were recorded for statistical assessment in all groups. Results: The mean age, number of children, number of siblings, were comparable between the subjects and controls (p> 0.05). LUTS and ED were more prevalent in drug and alcohol abusers when compared with their controls. Higher mean depression and anxiety scores of the drug and alcohol abusers highlighted their worse psychological status. The quality of life and sexual satisfaction assessment of the drug abusers yielded significantly lower results when compared with their controls. Regarding the comparison between alcohol addicts and their controls; quality of life scores were significantly higher whereas sexual satisfaction assessment results were comparable. The Qave values were similar between drug abusers and their controls while mean Qave was significantly higher in the alcohol addicts than their controls. Conclusion: ED and LUTS are more prevalent in alcohol and drug abusers when compared to healthy controls. It can be proposed that alcohol and drug addiction should be considered in the etiology of ED and LUTS especially in young adult population.","[Uluocak, N.; Atilgan, D.; Parlaktas, B.

Materials and methods: A number of 30 patients with confirmed CO poisoning and a number of 7 healthy control volunteers were involved into the study. All participants received at least 60 minutes of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2) at 2.5 atmospheres absolute (ATA). Standard blood gas analysis was performed on 10 mL venous blood samples obtained immediately before and after HBO2. Seven biomarkers and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels were measured. Results: Following HBO2, all patients recovered fully and were discharged in stable condition. Significant differences between pre and post HBO2 values were found in three of the seven biomarkers analyzed: TNF-alpha, IL-10, and S100B. Additionally, S100B and NSE levels were significantly different from controls for the 10 patients who experienced temporary loss of consciousness (LOC), and IL-6 levels were significantly different from controls for all CO-intoxicated patients. Conclusion: Conclusive evidence of a correlation between a single biomarker and LOC patients was not found. However, the data suggests that the significance of the fall between pre and post HBO2 values for TNF-alpha and IL-10, along with the resolution of IL-6 levels, may herald the severity of the patient's neurological condition.","[Vezzani, Giuliano; Caberti, Leonardo; Cantadori, Luca; Manelli, Daniele; Mordacci, Marco] Vaio Hosp, Parma, Italy; [Socias, Stephanie; Mangar, Devanand; Camporesi, Enrico M.] Florida Gulf To Bay Anesthesiol Associates LLC, Tampa Gen Circle, Tampa, FL USA; [Bianco, Antonino] Univ Palermo, Sport & Exercise Sci Res Unit, Via Giovanni Pascoli 6, I-90144 Palermo, Italy; [Paoli, Antonio; Bosco, Gerardo] Univ Padua, Dept Biomed Sci, I-35100 Padua, Italy","Bianco, A (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Sport & Exercise Sci Res Unit, Via Giovanni Pascoli 6, I-90144 Palermo, Italy.",,"Bianco, Antonino/AAB-8023-2020; Paoli, Antonio/A-6151-2015; Bianco, Antonino/AAI-7451-2020","Paoli, Antonio/0000-0003-0474-4229; Bianco, Antonino/0000-0001-8334-6581; BOSCO, GERARDO/0000-0001-6595-7944",,,"Akelma AZ, 2013, AM J EMERG MED, V31, P524, DOI 10.1016/j.ajem.2012.10.00; Brvar M, 2003, RESUSCITATION, V56, P105, DOI 10.1016/S0300-9572(02)00289-; Cakir Z, 2010, AM J EMERG MED, V28, P61, DOI 10.1016/j.ajem.2008.10.03; Ide T, 2012, AM J EMERG MED, V30, P222, DOI 10.1016/j.ajem.2010.11.02; Lippi G, 2012, CLIN BIOCHEM, V45, P1278, DOI 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.06.00; Martines F, 2015, EUR ARCH OTO-RHINO-L, V272, P2719, DOI 10.1007/s00405-014-3275-; Martines F, 2011, ORL-J OTO-RHIN-LARYN, V73, P137, DOI 10.1159/00032752; Prockop LD, 2007, J NEUROL SCI, V262, P122, DOI 10.1016/j.jns.2007.06.03; Rabczynski M, 2015, INT J OCCUP MED ENV, V28, P169, DOI 10.2478/s13382-014-0293-; Rasmussen LS, 2004, ACTA ANAESTH SCAND, V48, P469, DOI 10.1111/j.1399-6576.2004.00362.; Thom SR, 2010, CLIN TOXICOL, V48, P47, DOI 10.3109/1556365090346820; Weaver LK, 2009, NEW ENGL J MED, V360, P1217, DOI 10.1056/NEJMcp080889; Yardan T, 2009, AM J EMERG MED, V27, P838, DOI 10.1016/j.ajem.2008.04.01",13,4,4,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,189.0,193,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700029,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0013429752066115702,5.1498070498101625e-11,0.0024779299821800454,0.10457516339869281,0.0024779299821800454

They are composed of a benign epithelial component and a cellular, spindle cell stroma forming a leaf-like structure. No one morphologic finding is reliable in predicting the clinical behavior of the tumor. The rarity of phyllodes tumor and similarity to fibroadenoma necessitate studies and case series presentations delineating differential characteristics. We aimed to present our phylloides tumor experience to make contribution to the knowledge in the literature. Materials and method: This retrospective study includes 414 patients (62 Phyllodes tumor and 352 fibroadenoma)that were diagnosed and treated at Izmir Bozyaka Education and Research Hospital between January 2005 and January 2013. Patients demographic findings, tumor characteristics, diagnostic and treatment modalities and also their follow-up results were examined. Multivariate regression analysis and ROC curve were structured in order to see the significance. Results: The mean age was 42.5 (22-62) and mean tumor diameter was 4.4 (1,2-15) cm in phylloides tumor group. Breast preserving surgery was the preferred treatment of 52 and total mastectomy in 10 patients out of 62 phylloides tumor. The mean follow up time interval was 51 and 66 months for breast preserving and mastectomy patients respectively in phylloides tumor group. Recurrent cases in phylloides tumor group were respectively (12.5%) and 5 (12.5%) in breast preserving and mastectomy patients. Tumor size and patients age were found to be concordant with the type of histopathology (benign, borderline and malignant) of the phylloides tumor. Tumor size was found to be correlated with phylloides tumor diagnosis rather than fibroadenoma. Conclusion: Histopathologically more aggressive phylloides tumor is more likely in bigger tumor size and older age. This is also true in differential diagnosis of fibroadenoma in suspicion of phylloides tumor. The lesions greater than 3 cm should always be surgically excised with clear surgical margins.","[Yildirim, Mehmet; Carti, Erdem Baris; Ucar, Ahmet Deniz; Erkan, Nazif; Yakan, Savas; Sipahi, Ozgur Esen] Izmir Bozyaka Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Izmir, Turkey; [Vardar, Enver] Izmir Bozyaka Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Pathol, Izmir, Turkey; [Adibelli, Zehra] Izmir Bozyaka Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Radiol, Izmir, Turkey","Erkan, N (corresponding author), Izmir Bozyaka Educ & Res Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Surg, TR-35350 Izmir, Turkey.",,"Ucar, Ahmet Deniz/O-4435-2014; Yildirim, Mehmet/Y-7939-2018; Adibelli, Zehra Hilal/ABE-8234-2020; vardar, enver/AAB-1508-2020","Ucar, Ahmet Deniz/0000-0002-2678-3133; Adibelli, Zehra Hilal/0000-0001-9265-8114; ",,,"Barrio AV, 2007, ANN SURG ONCOL, V14, P2961, DOI 10.1245/s10434-007-9439-; Benningron J, 1979, PROBLEMS BREAST PATH, V11, P33; Blaker KM, 2010, AM SURGEON, V76, P30; Chaney A W, 1998, Radiat Oncol Investig, V6, P264, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6823(1998)6:6<264::AID-ROI3>3.0.CO;2-; Chelius M., 1827, NEUEJAHRABUCHER TEU; Chen WH, 2005, J SURG ONCOL, V91, P185, DOI 10.1002/jso.2033; FIKS A, 1981, VIRCHOWS ARCH A, V392, P1, DOI 10.1007/BF0043054; Foxcroft LM, 2007, BREAST, V16, P27, DOI 10.1016/j.breast.2006.05.00; Kapiris I, 2001, EUR J SURG ONCOL, V27, P723, DOI 10.1053/ejso.2001.120; Mishra SP, 2013, ISRN SURG, V2013, DOI DOI 10.1155/2013/36146; Priolo S., 1998, CONTEMP SURG, V53, P16; Ramakant P, 2013, INDIAN J CANCER, V50, P345, DOI 10.4103/0019-509X.12362; Reinfuss M, 1996, CANCER-AM CANCER SOC, V77, P910, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960301)77:5<910::AID-CNCR16>3.0.CO;2-; Reinfuss Martin, 1995, Strahlentherapie und Onkologie, V171, P; Richard J., 2009, BREAST ONCOLOGY, V16, P228; Richard J., 2009, ANN SURG ONCOLOGY, V1; Rosen PP., 2001, ROSENS BREAST PATHO; ROWELL MD, 1993, AM J SURG, V165, P376, DOI 10.1016/S0002-9610(05)80849-; Spitaleri G, 2013, CRIT REV ONCOLHEMATO, V1; World Health Organization, 1981, HIST TYP BREAST TUM HIST TYP BREAST TUM, V; Wurdinger S, 2005, AM J ROENTGENOL, V185, P1317, DOI 10.2214/AJR.04.162",21,1,1,0,2,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,1.0,,,,,157.0,161,,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,DL0QN,WOS:000375337700024,,,,,2022-07-14,0.0022727272727272726,1.8669633798976202e-08,0.004334360236312917,0.12774999010201524,0.004334360236312917

Material and method: This study included 541 adults with T2DM using 2010 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data. Results: The key study results were as follows: First, after adjusted for the related variables [age, gender, smoking, drinking, exercising, TC, 25(OH)D, and BMI], metabolic syndrome (p = 0.967) and MSS increases (p = 0.131) were not significantly associated with the HOMA-IR levels. Second, after adjusting the related variables (except BMI), MetS (p = 0.264) and MSS increases (p = 0.359) were not significantly associated with HOMA-B levels. However, when further adjusted for BMI, MetS (p = 0.004) and MSS increases (p = 0.010) were inversely associated with HOMA-B levels. Conclusion: Metabolic syndrome and increase of metabolic syndrome score were inversely associated with beta cell function, but were not independently associated with insulin resistance in Korean adults with T2DM.","[Yoon, Hyun] Hanlyo Univ, Dept Biomed Lab Sci, 94-13 Hallyeodae Gil, Gwangyang Si, Jellanam Do, South Korea; [Kim, Sung Gil] Hanlyo Univ, Dept Radiol Sci, 94-13 Hallyeodae Gil, Gwangyang Si, Jellanam Do, South Korea; [Kim, Gwang Seok] Chungbuk Hlth & Sci Univ, Emergency Med Technol, 10 Deogam Gil, Cheongju, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea; [Park, Bu Yeon] Seonam Univ, Dept Hosp Adm, 439 Chunhyang Ro, Namwon Si, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea","Yoon, H (corresponding author), Hanlyo Univ, Dept Biomed Lab Sci, 94-13 Hallyeodae Gil, Gwangyang Si, Jellanam Do, South Korea.",,"yoon, hyun/E-6542-2015","yoon, hyun/0000-0002-4741-9664",,,"Ahmed Shahid, 2010, J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad, V22, P2; Alarcon C, 2002, DIABETES, V51, P2496, DOI 10.2337/diabetes.51.8.249; Amer Diabet Assoc, 2012, DIABETES CARE, V35, pS64, DOI [10.2337/dc09-S062, 10.2337/dc11-S011, 10.2337/dc12-S064; Baez-Duarte BG, 2010, DIABET METAB SYND OB, V3, P301, DOI 10.2147/DMSOTT.S1237; Cai XL, 2014, BIOMED RES INT, V2014, DOI 10.1155/2014/64090; Cleeman JI, 2001, JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC, V285, P2486, DOI 10.1001/jama.285.19.248; Cubeddu LX, 2012, METAB SYNDR RELAT D, V10, P344, DOI 10.1089/met.2012.004; Gobato Amanda Oliva, 2014, Rev. paul. pediatr., V32, P55, DOI 10.1590/S0103-0582201400010001; Guo JJ, 2013, PAK J MED SCI, V29, P809, DOI 10.12669/pjms.293.298; Haffner SM, 2000, CIRCULATION, V101, P975, DOI 10.1161/01.CIR.101.9.97; Hanley AJG, 2003, DIABETES, V52, P2740, DOI 10.2337/diabetes.52.11.274; Harris MI, 1998, DIABETES CARE, V21, P518, DOI 10.2337/diacare.21.4.51; Heine RJ, 2006, BMJ-BRIT MED J, V333, P1200, DOI 10.1136/bmj.39022.462546.8; Imamura F, 2013, AM J EPIDEMIOL, V177, P1418, DOI 10.1093/aje/kws44; Iozzo P, 1999, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V84, P863, DOI 10.1210/jc.84.3.86; Kahn SE, 2001, J NUTR, V131, p354S, DOI 10.1093/jn/131.2.354; Kim KA, 2010, J DIABETES INVEST, V1, P232, DOI 10.1111/j.2040-1124.2010.00054.; Kitabchi AE, 2005, DIABETES, V54, P2404, DOI 10.2337/diabetes.54.8.240; Laws A, 1997, ARTERIOSCL THROM VAS, V17, P64, DOI 10.1161/01.ATV.17.1.6; Lee S, 2006, J KOREAN MED SCI, V21, P69; Liu YQ, 2002, J BIOL CHEM, V277, P39163, DOI 10.1074/jbc.M20715720; MATTHEWS DR, 1985, DIABETOLOGIA, V28, P412, DOI 10.1007/BF0028088; Nathan DM, 2009, DIABETES CARE, V32, P193, DOI 10.2337/dc08-902; REAVEN GM, 1988, DIABETES, V37, P1595, DOI 10.2337/diabetes.37.12.159; Robertson RP, 2007, CELL BIOCHEM BIOPHYS, V48, P139, DOI 10.1007/s12013-007-0026-; Saely CH, 2005, J CLIN ENDOCR METAB, V90, P5698, DOI 10.1210/jc.2005-079; Schmitz O, 2008, AGEING RES REV, V7, P301, DOI 10.1016/j.arr.2008.04.00; Sowjanya B, 2011, INT J APPL BIOL PHAR, V2, P16; Staten MA, 2010, DIABETES CARE, V33, P205, DOI 10.2337/dc09-120; Wallace TM, 2004, DIABETES CARE, V27, P1487, DOI 10.2337/diacare.27.6.148; World Health Organization, 2000, ASIA PACIFIC PERSPEC, P1; Yamada C, 2012, J DIABETES INVEST, V3, P185, DOI 10.1111/j.2040-1124.2011.00162.; Ying X, 2011, IRAN J PUBLIC HEALTH, V40, P; Yoon H, 2016, ENDOCR J, V63, P785, DOI 10.1507/endocrj.EJ16-010; Yoon H, 2015, METAB SYNDR RELAT D, V13, P329, DOI 10.1089/met.2015.003; Yoon H, 2015, J CLIN BIOCHEM NUTR, V57, P82, DOI 10.3164/jcbn.15-3; Zhou LJ, 2009, MOL PHARMACOL, V76, P596, DOI 10.1124/mol.109.05706",37,0,0,0,1,CARBONE EDITORE,PALERMO,"VIA QUINTINO SELLA, 68, PALERMO, 90139, ITALY",0393-6384,2283-9720,,ACTA MEDICA MEDITERR,Acta Medica Mediterr.,,2016,32,5.0,,,,,,,,10.19193/0393-6384_2016_5_152,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",General & Internal Medicine,EF2RM,WOS:000390172000023,,,,,2022-07-14,0.003822314049586777,1.435223868775387e-10,0.016255680239553028,0.11148605848411208,0.016248273138654536

The study method was correlational. The statistical population consisted of first grade female students of second high school in Kabudrahang in 2014-15. The sample size was estimated to be 210 individuals through Cochran formula. In so doing, multi-stage cluster sampling was employed. Data collection was carried out using Zajacova, Lynch and Espenshade academic stress questionnaire and Savari's procrastination survey. The results of Pearson correlation coefficient indicated that there is a direct significant relationship between female students' academic stress and the dimensions of intentional procrastination, procrastination caused by physical and mental fatigue, and procrastination caused by disorganization. The results of stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that in the second step, the dimensions of procrastination caused by mental and physical fatigue and also intentional procrastination can predict and explain 49% of changes in female students' academic stress. Therefore, it can be concluded that students' academic stress will decrease with a drop in their procrastination.","[Zohreyi, Tahereh] Islamic Azad Univ, Hamedan Branch, Educ Psychol, Hemedan, Iran; [Erfani, Nasrollah] Payame Noor Univ, Dept Psychol, Tehran, Iran; [Jadidiyan, Ahmad Ali] Islamic Azad Univ, Kangavar Branch, Kangavar, Iran","Erfani, N (corresponding author), Payame Noor Univ, Dept Psychol, Tehran, Iran.",erfani@pnu.ac.ir,,,,,"Abedi G., 2014, J MAZANDARAN U MED S, V24, P18; Abedi Gh, 2011, WORLD APPL SCI J, V12, P93; Akgun S., 2009, ED PSYCHOL, V23, P28; AMES C, 1992, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V84, P261, DOI 10.1037/0022-0663.84.3.26; Amirian S.

In order to fully clarify specific changes in the use intensity of antimicrobial agents for spinal orthopedic disease after comprehensive intervention and improve rationality of use of antimicrobial agents, this study selected 2000: cases of patients admitted to the spinal orthopedics department as research subjects and grouped them based On whether they received comprehensive intervention. 1000 patients admitted from January 2013 to January 2014 didn't receive comprehensive intervention and were classified as the reference group; 1000 patients admitted from May 2014 to May 2016 had comprehensive intervention and were classified as the observation group. Use intensity of antimicrobial drug was calculated with defined daily dose (DDD) as the unit, drug use intensity of the two groups of patients, was judged and analyzed using SPSS19.0 statistical software. The results show that after comprehensive intervention, antimicrobial use density (AUD) of,spinal orthopedics patients decreased from the original 69 23 DDDs/100 people / day to 22.30 DDDs1100 person / day. The difference between the two groups was compared and there is a significant statistical difference. Therefore, the results of this study fully confirm the specific role of comprehensive intervention in improving the use intensity of antimicrobial agents. Implementation' of comprehensive fluffing methods can effectively reduce use intensity' of antimicrobial agents of spinal orthopedics patients, and thus improve the rationality of drug use in treatment.","[Zong, Yang; Zhan, Yulin; Peng, Jun] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Affiliated Peoples Hosp 6, Dept Orthoped, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China","Peng, J (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Affiliated Peoples Hosp 6, Dept Orthoped, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.",,,,,,"Aldea M, 2016, ASIAN PAC J SURG ONC, V2, P16; August DA, 2016, ASIAN PAC J SURG ONC, V2, P15; Dobson P.
