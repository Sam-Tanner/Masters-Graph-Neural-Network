Pathologic assessment of tumor budding by light microscopy requires close evaluation of tumor invasive front on intermediate to high power magnification, entailing locating the 'hotspot' of tumor budding, counting all TB in one high power field, and generating a tumor budding score. By automating these time-consuming tasks, computer-assisted image analysis tools can be helpful for daily pathology practice, since tumor budding reporting is now recommended on select cases.

Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare systems is now emerging solution for modern e-healthcare system to provide high quality medical care. In this research work, we proposed a novel method which utilizes a modified vesselness measurement and a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to identify the oral cancer region structure in IoT based smart healthcare system. The robust vesselness filtering scheme handles noise while reserving small structures, while the CNN framework considerably improves classification accuracy by deblurring focused region of interest (ROI) through integrating with multi-dimensional information from feature vector selection step. The marked feature vector points are extracted from each connected component in the region and used as input for training the CNN. During classification, each connected part is individually analysed using the trained DCNN by considering the feature vector values that belong to its region. For a training of 1500 image dataset, an accuracy of 96.8% and sensitivity of 92% is obtained. Hence, the results of this work validate that the proposed algorithm is effective and accurate in terms of classification of oral cancer region in accurate decision making.

Although, research on AD has increased in recent years, however, the complexity associated with brain structure and functions makes the early diagnosis of this disease a challenging task. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a neuroimaging technology that has been widely used to study the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In literature, the computer-aided diagnosis of AD is limited to binary classification or diagnosis of AD and MCI stages. However, its applicability to diagnose multiple progressive stages of AD is relatively under-studied. This study explores the effectiveness of rs-fMRI for multi-class classification of AD and its associated stages including CN, SMC, EMCI, MCI, LMCI, and AD. A longitudinal cohort of resting-state fMRI of 138 subjects (25 CN, 25 SMC, 25 EMCI, 25 LMCI, 13 MCI, and 25 AD) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is studied. To provide a better insight into deep learning approaches and their applications to AD classification, we investigate ResNet-18 architecture in detail. We consider the training of the network from scratch by using single-channel input as well as performed transfer learning with and without fine-tuning using an extended network architecture. We experimented with residual neural networks to perform AD classification task and compared it with former research in this domain. The performance of the models is evaluated using precision, recall, f1-measure, AUC and ROC curves. We found that our networks were able to significantly classify the subjects. We achieved improved results with our fine-tuned model for all the AD stages with an accuracy of 100%, 96.85%, 97.38%, 97.43%, 97.40% and 98.01% for CN, SMC, EMCI, LMCI, MCI, and AD respectively. However, in terms of overall performance, we achieved state-of-the-art results with an average accuracy of 97.92% and 97.88% for off-the-shelf and fine-tuned models respectively. The Analysis of results indicate that classification and prediction of neurodegenerative brain disorders such as AD using functional magnetic resonance imaging and advanced deep learning methods is promising for clinical decision making and have the potential to assist in early diagnosis of AD and its associated stages.","[Ramzan, Farheen; Khan, Muhammad Usman Ghani; Rehmat, Asim; Iqbal, Sajid] UET, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Lahore, Pakistan; [Iqbal, Sajid] Bahauddin Zakariya Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Multan, Pakistan; [Saba, Tanzila; Rehman, Amjad] Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia; [Mehmood, Zahid] Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Engn, Taxila 47050, Pakistan","Iqbal, S (corresponding author), UET, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Lahore, Pakistan.;Iqbal, S (corresponding author), Bahauddin Zakariya Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Multan, Pakistan.",sajid.iqbal@bzu.edu.pk,"Iqbal, Sajid/AAS-8369-2020; Mehmood, Zahid/S-1709-2018; Saba, Tanzila/D-4593-2018","Mehmood, Zahid/0000-0003-4888-2594; Saba, Tanzila/0000-0003-3138-3801; iqbal, sajid/0000-0002-8464-2275","HEC Pakistan [NRPU-4223]; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (National Institutes of Health) [U01 AG024904]; DOD ADNI (Department of Defense) [W81XWH-12-2-0012]; National Institute on Aging; AbbVie; Alzheimer's Association; Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation; Araclon Biotech; BioClinica, Inc.; Biogen; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; CereSpir, Inc.; Cogstate; Eisai Inc.; Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Eli Lilly and Company; EuroImmun; Fujirebio; GE Healthcare; IXICO Ltd.; Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research & Development, LLC.; Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development LLC.; Lumosity; Lundbeck; Merck Co., Inc.; Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC.; NeuroRx Research; Neurotrack Technologies; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation; Pfizer Inc.; Piramal Imaging; Servier; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company; Transition Therapeutics; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) Lab Prince Sultan University Riyadh Saudi Arabia; F.

As an important basis for diagnosing heart disease and evaluating heart function, the electrocardiogram (ECG) records cardiac physiological electrical activity. Abnormalities in cardiac physiological activity are directly reflected in the ECG. Thus, ECG research is conducive to heart disease diagnosis. Considering the complexity of arrhythmia detection, we present an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) model for accurate classification. Compared with the traditional machine learning methods, CNN requires no additional feature extraction steps due to the automatic feature processing layers. In this paper, an improved CNN is proposed to automatically classify the heartbeat of arrhythmia. Firstly, all the heartbeats are divided from the original signals. After segmentation, the ECG heartbeats can be inputted into the first convolutional layers. In the proposed structure, kernels with different sizes are used in each convolution layer, which takes full advantage of the features in different scales. Then a max-pooling layer followed. The outputs of the last pooling layer are merged and as the input to fully-connected layers. Our experiment is in accordance with the AAMI inter-patient standard, which included normal beats (N), supraventricular ectopic beats (S), ventricular ectopic beats (V), fusion beats (F), and unknown beats (Q). For verification, the MIT arrhythmia database is introduced to confirm the accuracy of the proposed method, then, comparative experiments are conducted. The experiment demonstrates that our proposed method has high performance for arrhythmia detection, the accuracy is 99.06%. When properly trained, the proposed improved CNN model can be employed as a tool to automatically detect different kinds of arrhythmia from ECG.","[Wang, Haoren; Shi, Haotian; Chen, Xiaojun; Huang, Yixiang; Liu, Chengliang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Mech Engn, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Liqun] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Cardiol, Shanghai Peoples Hosp 1, 100 Haining Rd, Shanghai 200080, Peoples R China","Liu, CL (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Mech Engn, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",chlliu@sjtu.edu.cn,,"Chen, Xiaojun/0000-0002-0298-4491",National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB1307005]; Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning [2018ZHYL0226],"Our research is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2018YFB1307005), and the major project from Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning (No. 2018ZHYL0226).",,33,20,23,11,46,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

This manuscript employs a high pass filter image to prominent the inhomogeneities field effect of the MR slices and fused with the input slices. Moreover, the median filter is applied to the fused slices. The resultant slices quality is improved with smoothen and highlighted edges of the input slices. After that, based on these slices' intensity, a 4-connected seed growing algorithm is applied, where optimal threshold clusters the similar pixels from the input slices. The segmented slices are then supplied to the fine-tuned two layers proposed stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) model. The hyperparameters of the model are selected after extensive experiments. At the first layer, 200 hidden units and at the second layer 400 hidden units are utilized. The testing is performed on the softmax layer for the prediction of the images having tumors and no tumors.

The current research takes a two-study approach, with study 1 investigating if gender or price of the procedure affects willingness to undergo a robotic dental procedure. Study 2 further investigates this phenomenon, identifying ten separate types of dental procedures (ranging from minimally invasive to extremely invasive) to further understand consumer perceptions. Results indicate that females are less willing to undergo a robotic dental procedure, and that participants in general are more willing to undergo a procedure if it is half price than if it full price. Willingness is influenced by gender and the type of procedure being performed - participants were less willing to undergo invasive procedures such as gum surgery than noninvasive procedures such as teeth whitening.

Time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) methodology identifies cost drivers and reduces inaccurate costing based on siloed budgets. Inaccurate costing also results from the fact that current costing methods use charges and there has been tremendous cost shifting throughout health care. High cost, high variability processes can be identified for process improvement. As payment models inevitably evolve towards value-based metrics, it will be critical to knowledgably participate in the coordination of these changes. This document provides 8 practical Recommendations from the Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) aimed at outlining the principles of TDABC, creating process maps for patient workflows, understanding payment structures, establishing physician alignment across service lines to create integrated practice units to facilitate development of evidence-based pathways for specific patient risk groups, establishing consistent care delivery, minimizing variability between physicians and departments, utilizing data analytics and information technology tools to track progress and obtain actionable data, and using TDABC to create costing transparency.","[Allin, Olivia] Harvard Univ, Harvard Coll, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Urman, Richard D.; Bader, Angela M.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Surg & Publ Hlth, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Urman, Richard D.; Bader, Angela M.] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, 75 Francis St CWN L1, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Edwards, Angela F.] Wake Forest Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Winston Salem, NC 27101 USA; [Blitz, Jeanna D.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Pfeifer, Kurt J.] Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Med, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Feeley, Thomas W.] Harvard Univ, Harvard Business Sch, Inst Strategy & Competitiveness, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Urman, RD (corresponding author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Surg & Publ Hlth, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Urman, RD (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, 75 Francis St CWN L1, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",rurman@bwh.harvard.edu,"Urman, Richard/ABG-4830-2020","Urman, Richard/0000-0002-0516-5977",,,,24,9,9,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Reichertz is one of the most significant pioneers in the field of medical informatics worldwide. In 1969, 50 years ago, he became Professor at the Hannover Medical School. On the occasion of this anniversary an attempt was made to report on the scientific work of Peter Reichertz and to reflect on this work in the light of medical informatics knowledge today. The aim of this study was to search publications listings in the Peter L. Reichertz Archive, in Pubmed/Medline, and in the Web of Science. As well as to analyse contents and communication approaches to help in classifying Peter Reichertz's scientific publications. Three comprehensive publication lists were identified: the Print Bibliography (384 publications), the Disc Bibliography (285 publications) and the Selected Publications Bibliography (111 publications). Based on the last bibliography, a classification was built along the semantic dimensions of (1) major topics, (2) fields of publication, and (3) publication languages. Major contents of Peter Reichertz's research in informatics were medical informatics as a field (including education), informatics applications in medicine and health care, and health information systems. Clear shifts over time were observed. To his research on informatics applications, in the 1970s health information systems was added as topic, which then became a major part of his research. While in the 1960s and earlier German was a major publication language, from the 1970s onwards this shifted to English as the major language. Peter Reichertz very early identified the potential of computers in medicine and health care. He did not just use information and communication technology and information processing methodology as if they were other technology, such as microscopes or ultrasonic devices, for improving diagnosis and therapy. He was visionary enough to very early see the revolutionary potential of informatics for biomedicine and health care, with consequential impact on research and education.","[Haux, Reinhold] TU Braunschweig, Peter L Reichertz Inst Med Informat, Muehlenpfordtstr 23, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [Haux, Reinhold] Hannover Med Sch, Muehlenpfordtstr 23, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany","Haux, R (corresponding author), TU Braunschweig, Peter L Reichertz Inst Med Informat, Muehlenpfordtstr 23, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany.;Haux, R (corresponding author), Hannover Med Sch, Muehlenpfordtstr 23, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany.",Reinhold.Haux@plri.de,,"Haux, Reinhold/0000-0001-5376-8660",,,,47,0,0,1,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

A mobile app was developed to facilitate self-management skills following SCI in the inpatient rehabilitation and early community settings. The objective of this study was to explore patients' perspectives on the usability of this self-management app. A mixed-methods study design was implemented. The app was trialed at a local rehabilitation centre with 20 inpatient participants who experienced a SCI. They received mobile app training sessions throughout their inpatient rehabilitation. A thematic analysis was performed on qualitative data from post-discharge exit questionnaires and researchers' field notes. Quantitative data (in the form of participants' tool usage data and self-reported system usability scale scores) were collected at discharge and 3 months post-discharge. Three main themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: (1) being accessible to users (i.e., being easy to adopt and compatible with assistive technologies), (2) being intuitive to navigate (i.e., incorporating a simple app layout and a system of alert notifications), and (3) offering users flexibility (i.e., providing users with control over their data). The mobile app received above average mean system usability scale scores, both at discharge (78.1/100) and 3 months post-discharge (71.6/100). Given that participants found the app acceptable for use in inpatient rehabilitation and following discharge into the community, further testing is warranted to explore its efficacy in preventing secondary complications.","[Singh, Gurkaran; MacGillivray, Megan; Sawatzky, Bonita; Mortenson, W.

A more realistic approach is to develop a comprehensive outcome that includes cognitive functioning of dementia, as this will offer a robust and unbiased outcome for an individual. In this research, a mobile screening application for dementia traits called DementiaTest is proposed, which adopts the gold standard assessment criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). DementiaTest is implemented and tested on the Android and IOS stores. More importantly, it collects data from cases and controls using an easy, interactive, and accessible platform. It provides patients and their family with quick pre-diagnostic reports using certain cognitive functioning indicators; these can be utilized by general practitioners (GPs) for referrals for further assessment in cases of positive outcomes. The data gathered using the new application can be analysed using Artificial Intelligence methods to evaluate the performance of the screening to pinpoint early signs of the dementia.","[Thabtah, Fadi; Mampusti, Ella; Herradura, Raymund; Varghese, Jithin] Manukau Inst Technol, Digital Technol, Auckland, New Zealand; [Peebles, David] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Human & Hlth Sci, Ctr Appl Psychol Res, Dept Psychol, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England","Thabtah, F (corresponding author), Manukau Inst Technol, Digital Technol, Auckland, New Zealand.",fadi.fayez@manukau.ac.nz,,"Peebles, David/0000-0003-1008-9275",,,,38,7,8,4,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Studies conducted on adult (>= 18 years) patients between 2015 and February 2019 were deemed eligible. A total of 19 papers were included. Our review suggests that the use of Machine Learning (ML) in the field of OR organization has many potentials. Predictions of the surgical case duration were obtain with a good performance; their use could therefore allow a more precise scheduling, limiting waste of resources. ML is able to support even more complex models, which can coordinate multiple spaces simultaneously, as in the case of the post-anesthesia care unit and operating rooms. Types of Artificial Intelligence could also be used to limit another organizational problem, which has important economic repercussions: cancellation. Random Forest has proven effective in identifing surgeries with high risks of cancellation, allowing to plan preventive measures to reduce the cancellation rate accordingly. In conclusion, although data in literature are still limited, we believe that ML has great potential in the field of OR organization; however, further studies are needed to assess the effective role of these new technologies in the perioperative medicine.","[Bellini, Valentina; Bignami, Elena] Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Anesthesiol Crit Care & Pain Med Div, Viale Gramsci 14, I-43126 Parma, Italy; [Guzzon, Marco; Bigliardi, Barbara; Mordonini, Monica; Filippelli, Serena] Dept Engn & Architecture, Parco Area Sci 181-A, I-43124 Parma, Italy","Bignami, E (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Anesthesiol Crit Care & Pain Med Div, Viale Gramsci 14, I-43126 Parma, Italy.",elenagiovanna.bignami@unipr.it,,,,,,37,15,16,7,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Thus, it is necessary to enhance the accessibility of EHR by improving the user experience (UX). To apply information visualization that turns EHR data into an understandable visual format, we propose following five screen design principles when designing UX interfaces. #1: One view should contain single patient data. #2: Data should be summarized or titled for overview and details should be given on-demand. #3: Data should be displayed in time-series. #4: Data should be categorized by primary type. #5: More data should be displayed at the same time. Three screen designs are plausible utilizing the above-mentioned principles. To measure the UX of screen designs and validate the design principles, we built an EHR viewer system that has three windows corresponding to these screen designs and had it tested by medical staff. The results of the test revealed that the UX of the screen design is proportional to the number of design principles that the screen design incorporates.

This longitudinal, retrospective study enrolled 88 high-risk patients and had a follow-up time of 12.4 years. We collected clinical and laboratory data, as well as information on arterial stiffness parameters using arterial tonometry and measurements from ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. We considered nonfatal, incident cardiovascular events as the primary outcome. Given the small size of our dataset, we used survival analysis (i.e., Cox proportional hazards model) combined with a machine learning-based algorithm/penalization method to evaluate the data. Our predictive model, calculated with Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), included body mass index, diabetes mellitus, gender (male), and PWV. We recorded 16 nonfatal cardiovascular events (5 myocardial infarctions, 5 episodes of heart failure, and 6 strokes). The adjusted hazard ratio for PWV was 1.199 (95% confidence interval: 1.09-1.37, p < 0.001). Arterial stiffness was a predictor of cardiovascular disease development, as determined by PWV in a high-risk population. Thus, in obese, hypertensive, hyperglycemic patients with preserved kidney function, PWV can serve as a prognostic factor for major adverse cardiac events.","[Garcia-Carretero, Rafael; Vigil-Medina, Luis] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Mostoles Univ Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Mostoles, Spain; [Barquero-Perez, Oscar; Ramos-Lopez, Javier] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Signal Theory & Commun & Telemat Syst & Comp, Mostoles, Spain","Garcia-Carretero, R (corresponding author), Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Mostoles Univ Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Mostoles, Spain.",rgcarretero@salud.madrid.org; luis.vigil@salud.madrid.org; oscar.barquero@urjc.es; javier.ramos@urjc.es,"Garcia-Carretero, Rafael/E-1935-2015","Garcia-Carretero, Rafael/0000-0001-7532-4585",,,,38,10,10,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Prevention relies on periodic DR screening, yet overall national screening rates are not optimal, especially in low-income, minority patients. We prospectively evaluated show rates for prescheduled teleretinal DR screening appointments in diabetic patients (n = 301) in a large safety-net clinic in South Central Los Angeles. Patients were predominately African American (n = 88) and Latino (n = 200). Patients received either usual care telephone reminders or automated reminder calls in addition to usual care. The overall mean (SEM) show rate for DR screening, irrespective of reminder method, was low: 54 + 1.03%. Show rates with usual care alone were 46.3 + 2.6%, and with automated reminders added, 59.9 + 1.47% (p = 0.036). Show rate with usual care amongst African Americans was 23.6 + 6.46% compared with 53.2 + 3.41% for Latinos (p = 0.025). When automated calling was added, the show rate doubled amongst African Americans, to 51.6 + 3.96% (p = 0.002) with a slightly higher, non-significant show rate in Latinos. In summary, show rates for pre-scheduled teleretinal DR screening appointments were low with usual care alone in a safety-net clinic, with evidence for a racial disparity amongst low-income, minority patients with diabetes. Addition of a pre-recorded automated reminder call improved show rates, and corrected much of the racial disparity observed. Greater focus on failed appointments as an explanation for low DR screening rates and racial disparities, and as a potentially remediable target with automated reminders, may improve DR screening rates and reduce blindness in low-income minority patients with diabetes.","[Mehranbod, Christina; Genter, Pauline; Serpas, Lilian; Macias, Johana; Ipp, Eli] Harbor UCLA Med Ctr, 1124 West Carson St, Torrance, CA 90502 USA; [Mehranbod, Christina; Genter, Pauline; Serpas, Lilian; Macias, Johana; Ipp, Eli] Lundquist Res Inst, 1124 West Carson St, Torrance, CA 90502 USA; [Campa, David; Bermon, David; Ipp, Eli] Los Angeles Cty Dept Hlth Serv, Los Angeles, CA 90012 USA","Ipp, E (corresponding author), Harbor UCLA Med Ctr, 1124 West Carson St, Torrance, CA 90502 USA.;Ipp, E (corresponding author), Lundquist Res Inst, 1124 West Carson St, Torrance, CA 90502 USA.;Ipp, E (corresponding author), Los Angeles Cty Dept Hlth Serv, Los Angeles, CA 90012 USA.",ipp@labiomed.org,,"Ipp, Eli/0000-0003-1588-0146; Mehranbod, Christina/0000-0003-1235-3252","California Community Foundation [CMCH-14-111,663]; Genentech Foundation; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (CTSI grant) [UL1TR000124]","This study was funded by the California Community Foundation (principal investigator, EI, CMCH-14-111,663) and the Genentech Foundation.

Clear visual behaviour patterns were observable in all cases. There is a significant differences in visual attention distribution of the experts compared to the novices. Experts spent 79% of dwell time on the Echo screen and 17% on the Fluoro screen, novices spent 52% on the Echo screen and 40% on the Fluoro screen. Additionally, results showed that experts focused their gaze on smaller areas than novices during critical interventional actions. Operators seem to exhibit identifiable visual behaviour patterns for CBCVIs. These identifiable patterns were significantly different between the expert and the novice operators.

The introduction of smartphone ophthalmoscopes enables groups of teachers and students to view images together which could encourage peer-to-peer learning. In addition, the technology is significantly cheaper than the direct ophthalmoscope. User acceptability and engagement is essential to the success of any (medical) technological innovation. We sought to understand student opinions of a new commercially-available smartphone device for fundus examination, and compare usability to the traditional ophthalmoscope, from the perspective of both student practitioners and patients. Fifty-four undergraduate optometry students with prior experience of the traditional direct ophthalmoscope were asked to examine at least one eye with the D-EYE smartphone ophthalmoscope and also given an opportunity to experience the D-EYE from a patient's perspective. Minimal instructions were provided and all examinations conducted through undilated pupils. Participants completed an opinion survey to feedback on aspects such as the ease of handling and working distance. Compared to the direct ophthalmoscope, 92% of students preferred the (longer) working distance of the D-EYE; 77% felt it was easier to handle; and 92% preferred the patient experience with the D-EYE. Despite the positive feedback, only 43% of students preferred the D-EYE when assuming the role of the practitioner. Free text responses indicated that students felt the D-EYE may be most useful as a teaching tool.

The structure and shape of the organ, combined with morphological measurements such as volume and curvature, can provide significant guidance towards establishing progression or severity of a condition, and thus support improved diagnosis and therapy planning. Furthermore, the classification and stratification of organ abnormalities aim to explore and investigate organ deformations following injury, trauma and illness. This paper presents a framework for automatic morphological feature extraction in computer-aided 3D organ reconstructions following organ segmentation in 3D radiological scans. Two different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets are evaluated. Using the MRI scans of 85 adult volunteers, the overall mean volume for the pancreas organ is 69.30 +/- 32.50cm(3), and the 3D global curvature is (35.23 +/- 6.83) x 10(-3). Another experiment evaluates the MRI scans of 30 volunteers, and achieves mean liver volume of 1547.48 +/- 204.19cm(3) and 3D global curvature (19.87 +/- 3.62) x 10(- 3). Both experiments highlight a negative correlation between 3D curvature and volume with a statistical difference (p < 0.0001). Such a tool can support the investigation into organ related conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and liver disease.","[Asaturyan, Hykoush; Villarini, Barbara] Univ Westminster, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, London, England; [Thomas, E.

However, the advancement of ophthalmic imaging technologies produces an ever-growing scale of retina images, both in volume and variety, which overwhelms the ophthalmologist ability to segment these images. While many automated methods exist, speckle noise and intensity inhomogeneity negatively impacts the performance of these methods. We present a comprehensive and fully automatic method for annotation of retinal layers in OCT images comprising of fuzzy histogram hyperbolisation (FHH) and graph cut methods to segment 7 retinal layers across 8 boundaries. The FHH handles speckle noise and inhomogeneity in the preprocessing step. Then the normalised vertical image gradient, and it's inverse to represent image intensity in calculating two adjacency matrices and then the FHH reassigns the edge-weights to make edges along retinal boundaries have a low cost, and graph cut method identifies the shortest-paths (layer boundaries). The method is evaluated on 150 B-Scan images, 50 each from the temporal, foveal and nasal regions were used in our study. Promising experimental results have been achieved with high tolerance and adaptability to contour variance and pathological inconsistency of the retinal layers in all (temporal, foveal and nasal) regions. The method also achieves high accuracy, sensitivity, and Dice score of 0.98360, 0.9692 and 0.9712, respectively in segmenting the retinal nerve fibre layer. The annotation can facilitate eye examination by providing accurate results. The integration of the vertical gradients into the graph cut framework, which captures the unique characteristics of retinal structures, is particularly useful in finding the actual minimum paths across multiple retinal layer boundaries. Prior knowledge plays an integral role in image segmentation.","[Dodo, Bashir Isa; Li, Yongmin; Eltayef, Khalid; Liu, Xiaohui] Brunel Univ London, Dept Comp Sci, Kingston Lane, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England","Dodo, BI (corresponding author), Brunel Univ London, Dept Comp Sci, Kingston Lane, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",dokkt1k@yahoo.com; yongmin.li@brunel.ac.uk; Khalid.Eltayef@brunel.ac.uk; xiaohui.liu@brunel.ac.uk,"Dodo, Bashir Isa/AAI-7448-2020","Dodo, Bashir Isa/0000-0001-5467-4324",,,,48,4,4,1,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In this article, a novel computerized automated method is proposed for the classification of abdominal infections of gastrointestinal track from WCE images. Three core steps of the suggested system belong to the category of segmentation, deep features extraction and fusion followed by robust features selection. The ulcer abnormalities from WCE videos are initially extracted through a proposed color features based low level and high-level saliency (CFbLHS) estimation method. Later, DenseNet CNN model is utilized and through transfer learning (TL) features are computed prior to feature optimization using Kapur's entropy. A parallel fusion methodology is opted for the selection of maximum feature value (PMFV). For feature selection, Tsallis entropy is calculated later sorted into descending order. Finally, top 50% high ranked features are selected for classification using multilayered feedforward neural network classifier for recognition.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of texture features derived from apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, to serve as imaging markers for predicting important histopathologic prognostic factors in rectal cancer. One hundred patients of rectal cancer received 3 T preoperative magnetic resonance imaging including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Skewness, kurtosis, uniformity from the histogram and entropy, energy, inertia, correlation from gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) derived from whole-lesion volumes were measured. Independent sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used for statistical analysis. Uniformity, energy and entropy were significantly different (p = 0.026, 0.001, and 0.006, respectively) between stage pT1-2 and pT3-4 tumors. Skewness, kurtosis and correlation were significantly different (p = 0.000, 0.006, and 0.041, respectively) between grade 1-2 and grade 3 tumors. Energy and entropy (p = 0.008 and 0.033, respectively) could significantly differentiate negative circumferential resection margin (CRM) from positive CRM. Furthermore, predicted probabilities derived by logistic regression analysis yielded greater area under the curve (AUC) in differentiating pT3-4 stage and grade 3 grade tumors. Texture features derived from ADC maps may useful to predict important histopathologic prognostic factors of rectal cancer.","[Lu, Zhihua; Wang, Lei; Xia, Kaijian; Jiang, Heng; Weng, Xiaoyan; Jiang, Jianlong; Wu, Mei] Soochow Univ, Peoples Hosp Changshu City 1, Changshu Hosp, Changshu, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Lu, ZH (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Peoples Hosp Changshu City 1, Changshu Hosp, Changshu, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",luzhihua79@163.com,,,Jiangsu Provincial Medical Youth Talent [QNRC2016212]; Suzhou Clinical Special Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Program [LCZX201823]; Suzhou GuSu Medical Talent Project [GSWS2019077]; Science and Technology Bureau of Changshu [CS201624],"This study was funded by Jiangsu Provincial Medical Youth Talent (QNRC2016212), Suzhou Clinical Special Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Program (LCZX201823), Suzhou GuSu Medical Talent Project (GSWS2019077) and Science and Technology Bureau of Changshu (CS201624).",,42,13,15,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Heart rate (variability) was measured upon waking. Log-transformed HRV metrics were evaluated in three segments (first min discarded for stabilization): 0-3 min supine, 3-6 min supine, and standing. Heart rate was assessed while supine, 15 s after standing and average final 30 s standing (Rusko protocol). A RM-ANOVA compared intra-individual means, standard deviations (SD) and coefficients of variation (CV%) for HRV and heart rate. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEmeas) were used for relative and absolute reliability, respectively. Time and frequency domain HRV metrics had low variation (CV% <8.5%; SEmeas% <= 4.0%) for 0-3 min supine which was not improved during 3-6 min. Standing HRV had lower ICC and higher SEmeas than supine values. Variability and reliability outcomes for heart rate were comparable to log-transformed HRV metrics. This study uniquely describes the intra-individual variation of HRV metrics during an orthostatic challenge and demonstrated low variability in this cohort of elite male athletes. These data can be helpful for identifying when true individual changes occur for the autonomic nervous system indices in supine and standing positions.","[Vescovi, Jason D.] Univ Toronto, Grad Sch Exercise Sci, Fac Kinesiol & Phys Educ, Toronto, ON, Canada","Vescovi, JD (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Grad Sch Exercise Sci, Fac Kinesiol & Phys Educ, Toronto, ON, Canada.",VescoviJ@aol.com,,"Vescovi, Jason/0000-0003-2656-5109","Research Program in Applied Sport Sciences from the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport (Ontario, Canada)","This study was funded by the Research Program in Applied Sport Sciences from the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport (Ontario, Canada).",,40,4,4,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Persons with diabetes and health professionals were involved the design, development and evaluation of the self-management system; which comprised three iterative cycles: scenario definition, user archetype definition and system development. A comprehensive system was developed integrating modules for the management of blood glucose levels, medication, food intake habits, physical activity, diabetes education and messaging. The system was adapted for two types of principal users (personas): Type 1 Diabetes user and Type 2 Diabetes user. The system was evaluated by assessing the use, the compliance, the attractiveness and perceived usefulness in a multicenter randomized pilot study involving 20 patients and 24 treating professionals for a period of four weeks. Usage and compliance of the co-designed system was compared during the first and the last two weeks of the study, showing a significantly improved behaviour of patients towards the system for each of the modules. This resulted in a successful adoption by both type of personas. Only the medication module showed a significantly different use and compliance (p= 0.01) which can be explained by the different therapeutic course of the two types of diabetes.

While many management processes have been adapted for NORA from the traditional operating room, it is still unclear what scheduling paradigm will maximize efficiency of resource utilization in this arena. In this study, we investigate the impact of tactical a shift from a shared group to individual, provider-specific block allocations for available anesthesia time in an endoscopy suite for adult patients undergoing elective endoscopy procedures at an academic hospital. Using a retrospective and prospective analysis, we measured elective time-in-block; elective time out-of-block; under-utilized (opportunity and non-opportunity unused) time; over-utilized time; and case tardiness to determine operational efficiency and clinical productivity. Over the study period, the monthly caseload remained constant. Elective time in block increased by 156% (p < 0.0001) and elective time out of block decreased by 38% (p < 0.0001). Opportunity unused time decreased by 28% (p < 0.0001) and productivity increased by 51% (p < 0.0001). Neither over-utilized time nor case tardiness showed a significant change after the intervention. Despite the evidence base supporting traditional approaches to anesthesia block allocation involving group block allocation and non-sequential case scheduling, we have demonstrated an advantage to individual block allocation in a GI endoscopy setting. This sequential case scheduling highlights how tactical decisions in NORA environments may require a rethinking of many practices that anesthesiologists have brought with them from the traditional OR. Using these efficiency and productivity metrics, further adjustments to scheduling practices should be investigated, and connecting these metrics to other systems outcomes, such as financial productivity, is an important next step as NORA services expand into the future.","[Tsai, Mitchell H.] Univ Vermont, Dept Anesthesiol, Larner Coll Med, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Tsai, Mitchell H.] Univ Vermont, Dept Orthoped & Rehabil, Larner Coll Med, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Tsai, Mitchell H.] Univ Vermont, Dept Surg, Larner Coll Med, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Hall, Michael A.] Anesthesia Serv PA, Dept Anesthesiol, Christiana Care Hlth Syst, Newark, DE USA; [Cardinal, Melanie S.] Green Mt Surg Ctr, Colchester, VT USA; [Breidenstein, Max W.] Univ Vermont, Dept Anesthesiol, Med Ctr, 111 Colchester Ave, Burlington, VT USA; [Abajian, Michael J.] Univ Vermont, Coll Nursing & Hlth Sci, Dept Nursing, Burlington, VT USA; [Zubarik, Richard S.] Univ Vermont, Dept Internal Med, Div Gastroenterol, Larner Coll Med, Burlington, VT USA","Tsai, MH (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Anesthesiol, Larner Coll Med, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.;Tsai, MH (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Orthoped & Rehabil, Larner Coll Med, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.;Tsai, MH (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Surg, Larner Coll Med, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",Mitchell.Tsai@uvmhealth.org,,,,,,19,1,1,1,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Firstly, the sample in euclidean space is mapped into the high dimensional feature space through the kernel function. Then the linear weighted filtering image is obtained by combining the current pixel with its neighborhood pixels through the space information in CT image. Finally, the two-dimensional histogram between the clustered pixel and its neighborhood mean is introduced into the robust kernel space image fuzzy clustering, and the iterative expression of the fast robust fuzzy clustering in kernel space is obtained by using Lagrange multiplier method. The experimental results on four databases show that our proposed method can segment liver tumors from abdominal CT volumes effectively and automatically, and the comprehensive segmentation performance of the proposed method is superior to that of several existing methods.","[Cai, Jianhong] Hubei Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430064, Hubei, Peoples R China","Cai, JH (corresponding author), Hubei Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430064, Hubei, Peoples R China.",caijianhongls@163.com,,,,,,38,5,5,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

As a crucial application of IoT, telecare medicine information system (TMIS) provides people a high quality of life and advanced level of medical service. In TMIS, smart card-based authenticated key agreement schemes for multi-server architectures have gathered momentum and positive impetus due to the conventional bound of a single server. However, we demonstrate that most of the protocols in the literatures can not implement strong security features in TMIS, such as Lee et al.'s and Shu's scheme. They store the identity information directly, which fail to provide strong anonymity and suffer from password guessing attack. Then we propose an extended authenticated key agreement scheme (short for AKAS) with strong anonymity for multi-server environment in TMIS, by enhancing the security of the correlation parameters stored in the smart cards and calculating patients' dynamic identities. Furthermore, the proposed chaotic map-based scheme provides privacy protection and is formally proved under Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic. At the same, the informal security analysis attests that the AKAS scheme not only could resist the multifarious security attacks but also improve efficiency by 21% compared with Lee et al.'s and Shu's scheme.","[Qiao, Hui; Dong, Xuewen; Shen, Yulong] Xidian Univ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Shen, YL (corresponding author), Xidian Univ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",qiaohui1007300405@163.com; xwdong@xidian.edu.cn; ylshen@mail.xidian.edu.cn,"Qiao, Hui/AAA-4976-2021",,"National key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB1400704]; Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province [2019ZDLGY12-03, 2019ZDLGY13-06, 2019ZDLGY12-04, 2019Z-DLGY13-01]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61972310, 61972308, 61902295]","This work is supported in part by the National key Research and Development Program of China under Grant No. 2017YFB1400704, the Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province under Grant No. 2019ZDLGY12-03, 2019ZDLGY13-06, 2019ZDLGY12-04 and 2019Z-DLGY13-01, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61972310, 61972308 and 61902295.",,28,7,7,5,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Since patients still get a paper proof of the ePrescription, sometimes pharmacists use the ePrescription as paper-based prescription. When the government demands a complete dematerialization, i.e. no more paper-based prescriptions, this will no longer be possible. Therefore, we questioned the frequency and reasons for treating an ePrescription as paper-based. The logged interactions in the national database were used to identify possible reasons. The tarification service Koninklijk Limburgs Apothekers Verbond (KLAV) provided prescriptions of June 2018. KLAV supports tarification for community pharmacies all over Belgium, thereby providing a representative sample for the Belgian community pharmacies. A two-stage cluster random sampling technique was applied to retrieve a subset of 10,000 prescriptions. In this subset we identified 4961 ePrescriptions (49.61%) of which 226 (4.56%, in total 2.26%) were treated as paper-based. Reasons observed for this incorrect handling are (1) non-compliance of the community pharmacist; (2) errors in software or handling of the community pharmacist; (3) errors at the prescriber side or patient tries to fraud; (4) incorrectly revoking the ePrescription; and (5) errors in software of prescriber. The main reasons for treating ePrescriptions as paper-based are non-compliance of the community pharmacist (n = 124, 54.87%) by ignoring its digital nature, and errors in software or handling of the community pharmacist (n = 85, 37.61%). Future research is necessary to investigate user opinions and to measure the impact of introducing ePrescribing in the daily routine.","[Van Laere, Sven; Buyl, Ronald] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Publ Hlth GEWE, Laarbeeklaan 103, B-1090 Brussels, Belgium; [Cornu, Pieter] Vrije Univ Brussel, Ctr Pharmaceut Res CePhar, Laarbeeklaan 103, B-1090 Brussels, Belgium; [Dreesen, Evy; Lenie, Jan] KLAV, Tarificat Serv, Ilgatlaan 3, B-3500 Hasselt, Belgium","Van Laere, S (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Publ Hlth GEWE, Laarbeeklaan 103, B-1090 Brussels, Belgium.",Sven.Van.Laere@vub.be; Pieter.Cornu@vub.be; Evy.Dreesen@klav.be; Jan.Lenie@klav.be; Ronald.Buyl@vub.be,"Buyl, Ronald/F-3862-2015","Buyl, Ronald/0000-0002-6598-9505; Van Laere, Sven/0000-0001-8474-9729; Cornu, Pieter/0000-0002-4802-0241",,,,17,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Bluetooth is one of the most popular and widely adopted means of communicating this sensed information to a mobile terminal. However, over simplified implementations of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) protocol in eHealth sector is susceptible to several wireless attacks, in particular the Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. The issue arises due to a lack of mutual authentication and integrity protection between the communicating devices, which may lead to compromise of confidentiality, availability and even the integrity of this safety-critical information. This research paper presents a novel framework named MARC to detect, analyze, and mitigate Bluetooth security flaws while focusing upon MITM attack against NiNo devices. For this purpose, a comprehensive solution has been proposed, which can detect MITM signatures based upon four novel anomaly detection metrics: analyzing Malicious scan requests, Advertisement intervals, RSSI levels, and Cloned node addresses. The proposed solution has been evaluated through practical implementation and demonstration of different attack scenarios, which show promising results concerning accurate and efficient detection of MITM attacks.","[Yaseen, Muhammad; Iqbal, Waseem; Rashid, Imran; Abbas, Haider; Bangash, Yawar Abbas] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Signals, Dept Informat Secur, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Abbas, Haider] NUST, Islamabad 46000, Pakistan; [Mohsin, Ahid] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Aeronaut Engn, Dept Avion Engn, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Saleem, Kashif] King Saud Univ, Ctr Excellence Informat Assurance, Riyadh 12372, Saudi Arabia","Abbas, H (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Signals, Dept Informat Secur, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.;Abbas, H (corresponding author), NUST, Islamabad 46000, Pakistan.",dr.h.abbas@ieee.org,"Abbas, Haider/G-1077-2014; Abbas, Haider/ABB-1219-2021; Saleem, Kashif/K-1140-2012","Abbas, Haider/0000-0002-2437-4870; Abbas, Haider/0000-0002-2437-4870; Saleem, Kashif/0000-0001-8062-3301; Iqbal, Waseem/0000-0002-3616-2621",Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University [RG-1439-022],The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University for funding this work through research group no (RG-1439-022).,,27,9,9,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Secondly, Squeeze-and-Excitation block is embedded to learn feature weights, using feature re-calibration to improve network representation, and the robustness of the network is enhanced by adding spatial pyramid pooling.

It includes as well an investigation of the relationships between the functional sizes of these apps, their ratings in the apps stores, as well as the number of installs. As results, it was noticed that there is a considerable shift between the rankings of the functional sizes and the functionality scores obtained in the opinion-based questionnaire, for most of the apps assessed. Moreover, the study of the relationship between the functional sizes and the ratings, as well as the number of installs indicated that these variables are not linked, since they are impacted by external factors. The findings support the use of the COSMIC method for these apps in regard to measuring the functional size for further updates or improvements, which can also help developers to have an overview about the existing apps on the market and compare between them.

This limits the use of surgical image-guidance technologies and challenges the appropriate placement of trocars, which influences the operative ease and potential quality of laparoscopic surgery. This work describes the development of a platform that simulates pneumoperitoneum in a patient-specific manner, using preoperative CT scans as input data. This aims to provide a more realistic representation of the intraoperative scenario and guide trocar positioning to optimize the ergonomics of laparoscopic instrumentation. The simulation was developed by generating 3D reconstructions of insufflated and deflated porcine CT scans and simulating an artificial pneumoperitoneum on the deflated model. Simulation parameters were optimized by minimizing the discrepancy between the simulated pneumoperitoneum and the ground truth model extracted from insufflated porcine scans. Insufflation modeling in humans was investigated by correlating the simulation's output to real post-insufflation measurements obtained from patients in theatre. The simulation returned an average error of 7.26 mm and 10.5 mm in the most and least accurate datasets respectively. In context of the initial discrepancy without simulation (23.8 mm and 19.6 mm), the methods proposed here provide a significantly improved picture of the intraoperative scenario. The framework was also demonstrated capable of simulating pneumoperitoneum in humans. This study proposes a method for realistically simulating pneumoperitoneum to achieve optimal ergonomics during laparoscopy. Although further studies to validate the simulation in humans are needed, there is the opportunity to provide a more realistic, interactive simulation platform for future image-guided minimally invasive surgery.","[Dawda, Shivali; Camara, Mafalda; Pratt, Philip; Vale, Justin; Darzi, Ara; Mayer, Erik] Imperial Coll London, Dept Surg & Canc, London, England","Dawda, S (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Surg & Canc, London, England.",shivali.dawda@gmail.com,"; Mayer, Erik/A-6207-2013","Dawda, Shivali/0000-0002-3091-2305; Mayer, Erik/0000-0002-5509-4580",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Imperial Biomedical Research Centre (BRC),"This work is independent research funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Imperial Biomedical Research Centre (BRC).

Then, taking the burst imaging cohort and the calculation data set of new cervical cancer cases as the objects, based on the difficulties of cervical cancer feature modeling, this paper proposes the transfer learning algorithm of clinical and pathological features of cervical cancer. Finally, a medical intelligent computing system for cervical cancer pathology analysis and calculation with high efficiency and reliability is established. A series of proposed algorithms are compared with single-scale Retinex (SSR), which is based on single-scale Retinex migration learning (SSR-TL).

This study conducts a review to substantially analyse and map the research landscape of current technologies, mainly the use of blockchain in healthcare applications, into a coherent taxonomy. The present study systematically searches all relevant research articles on blockchain in healthcare applications in three accessible databases, namely, ScienceDirect, IEEE and Web of Science, by using the defined keywords 'blockchain', 'healthcare' and 'electronic health records' and their variations. The final set of collected articles related to the use of blockchain in healthcare application is divided into three categories. The first category includes articles (i.e. 43/58 scientific articles) that attempted to develop and design healthcare applications integrating blockchain, particularly those on new architecture, system designs, framework, scheme, model, platform, approach, protocol and algorithm. The second category includes studies (i.e., 6/58 scientific articles) that attempted to evaluate and analyse the adoption of blockchain in the healthcare system. Finally, the third category comprises review and survey articles (i.e., 6/58 scientific articles) related to the integration of blockchain into healthcare applications. The final articles for review are discussed on the basis of five aspects: (1) year of publication, (2) nationality of authors, (3) publishing house or journal, (4) purpose of using blockchain in health applications and the corresponding contributions and ((5)) problem types and proposed solutions.

Traditional segmentation algorithms often require manual intervention or introduction of some prior information, which results in low efficiency and is unable to meet clinical needs. In order to overcome the sensitivity of classical fuzzy clustering image segmentation algorithm to image noise, this paper proposes a fuzzy clustering image segmentation algorithm combining Gaussian regression model (GRM) and hidden Markov random field (HMRF). The algorithm uses the prior information to regularize the objective function of the fuzzy C-means, and then improves it with KL information. The HMRF model establishes the neighborhood relationship of the label field by prior probability, while CRM model establishes the neighborhood relationship of feature field on the basis of the consistency between the central pixel label and its neighborhood pixel label. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has high segmentation accuracy.","[Liu, Haiyang] Shangluo Cent Hosp, Dept Radiol, Shangluo 726000, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Dai, Guochao] First Peoples Hosp Kashgar, Image Ctr, Kashgar 844000, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Pu, Fushun] First Peoples Hosp Honghe State, Southern Cent Hosp Yunnan Prov, Mengzi 661199, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Pu, FS (corresponding author), First Peoples Hosp Honghe State, Southern Cent Hosp Yunnan Prov, Mengzi 661199, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",hhzfskmri@126.com,,,,,,22,1,1,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

It provides better services than fog-cloud computing with better performance in reasonably low cost way and allows users to eliminate numerous limitations inherent in fog-cloud computing, although it inherits those security-privacy issues from fog-cloud computing. A novel privacy-preserving mutual authentication in TMIS for mobile Edge-Cloud architecture (abbreviated to NPMA) is constructed in this paper. NPMA scheme not only mitigates some weaknesses of fog-cloud computing, but has other advantages. First, NPMA scheme supports patients(edge-servers) anonymity and forward-backward untraceability (traceability, when needed), since their identities are hidden in two distinct dynamic anonyms and a static one and only the trusted center can recover their real identities, when needed. Second, each edge-server shares a secret value, which realizes authentication with extremely low computional cost in authentication phase. Finally, NPMA scheme is proven safely against passive and active attacks under elliptic curve computable Diffie-Hellman problem (ECDHP) assumption in random oracle model. Hence, it achieves the required security properties and outperforms prior approaches in terms of energy and computational costs.","[Liu, Xiaoxue; Ma, Wenping; Cao, Hao] Xidian Univ, 2 South Taibai Rd, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Cao, Hao] Anhui Sci & Technol Univ, Chuzhou 233100, Peoples R China","Liu, XX (corresponding author), Xidian Univ, 2 South Taibai Rd, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",862417756@qq.com; wp_ma@mail.xidian.edu.cn; 13655505689@163.com,,,The 111 Project [B08038] Funding Source: Medline; National Science Foundation of China under grant [61373171] Funding Source: Medline; the Program for Excellent Young Talents in University of Anhui Province under Grant [gxyqZD2019060] Funding Source: Medline; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0802400] Funding Source: Medline; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and the Innovation Fund of Xidian University [5001-20109195456] Funding Source: Medline,,,31,7,7,3,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the use of technology by medical students and assess the effect of a newly developed mobile app for the study of human physiology. We used a standardised questionnaire to assess the profile of educational technology use, from which a mobile app (PhysioQuiz) was developed. The effectiveness and user opinion were assessed in a randomised controlled study (n = 110). Of 1022 students enrolled in medical school, 489 (47.9%) participated in the study. Of the respondents, 96.7% used mobile applications, with the main purpose being entertainment (94.7%) and study (81.9%). Only 6.1% reported use of physiology apps. PhysioQuiz use did not yield higher average grades (p = 0.48); however, user opinion demonstrated that it was useful for assisted learning (82.1%) and identification of non-learned content (78.6%) and considered a tool for self-assessment (89.3%).

To achieve the development of this research, first, a photosensitive device was designed, which is formed by a phototransistor with a transparent casing allowing the red light coming from a red LED to penetrate the sensor. This means, that when the intensity of the light varies, the amount of current flowing through the sensor also changes. In consequence, this variation in electric current causes a variation on the voltage drop across the connections of a resistor, which is read by a microcontroller that calculates the number of red blood cells. Second, some formulas were established to represent the relationship between the extreme points of a data set obtained during a sampling process. Finally, to verify the device operation, a sampling process was performed in volunteer patients (range 18-84 years) with venous blood samples run on a laboratory hematology analyzer, a total 68 measurements were made to people of different ages and genders, of which 34 are females and 34 are males.","[Quinonez, Yadira] Univ Autonoma Sinaloa, Mazatlan, Mexico; [Almeraya, Said; Almeraya, Selin; Reyna, Jorge] Inst Tecnol Mazatlan, Mazaltan, Mexico; [Mejia, Jezreel] Ctr Invest Matemat, Zacatecas, Mexico","Quinonez, Y (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Sinaloa, Mazatlan, Mexico.",yadiraqui@uas.edu.mx; 141000013@itmazatlan.edu.mx; almerayamorales@hotmail.com; reynajr@itmazatlan.edu.mx; jmejia@cimat.mx,,"Quinonez, Yadira/0000-0002-7604-8532",,,,22,0,0,5,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The underlying motive behind the image restoration is devoted to the augmentation of the perceived visual impact of image so as to make it almost identical to the original image. A host of exploration approaches are now in vogues which are intended to steer clear of the noise, thereby regaining the images with original quality. In our earlier research, two distinct noise elimination methods like the (OGHP) and SURE shrinkage were effectively employed for the purpose of denoising, though the relative PSNR and SSIM efficiencies did not come up to the desired level. In the innovative approach envisaged in the document, at the outset, the noise is included by means of two processes like the salt and pepper and impulse noise. Subsequently, the pre-processing methods are performed with the able assistance of two novel filters such as the adaptive median filter and adaptive fuzzy switching. Thereafter, the preprocessed image is furnished to the succeeding function of noise elimination like the (OGHP) and SURE shrinkage. In the course of the OGHP noise elimination technique, the GHP constraints are optimized by employing the Cuckoo Search Algorithm. Thereafter, the noise-eliminated image is effectively estimated with the help of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The consequential noiseless images are subjected to the image restoration procedure by efficiently employing the AGA approach. The cheering performance outcomes chant the success stories of the novel image restoration method, highlighting its superlative efficiency. Moreover, the efficacy of the innovative approach is assessed by means of a set of noise-polluted images and contrasted with the modern noiseless image restoration technique.","[Sankaran, Sakthidasan K.; Vasudevan, N.; Diderot, Kumara Guru P.] Hindustan Inst Technol & Sci, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Chennai 603103, Tamil Nadu, India; [Nagarajan, V] Adhiparasakthi Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Melmaruvathur 603319, India","Sankaran, KS (corresponding author), Hindustan Inst Technol & Sci, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Chennai 603103, Tamil Nadu, India.",sakthidasan.sankaran@gmail.com; drvasudevan93@gmail.com; diderotpec2007@gmail.com; nagarajanece31@gmail.com,"Sankaran, Sakthidasan/D-7185-2019; velmurugan, nagarajan/AAD-6724-2020; N, Vasudevan/AAG-1051-2021; Sankaran, K./AAA-2986-2020","Sankaran, Sakthidasan/0000-0002-5905-0809; velmurugan, nagarajan/0000-0002-1031-0737; N, Vasudevan/0000-0003-2021-2361; ",,,,16,4,4,3,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

However, there exist some limitations in the use of HRV in the clinical practice. Examples are the lack of reference values for healthy populations, different HR (Heart Rate) acquisition systems, and varying software packages. Other factors that affect HRV values are the influence of lifestyle, drugs and alcohol consumption, and pollution. In this work, recommendations to perform HRV-based experiments were established. These suggestions refer to best moment of the day to record data, the optimal body position, and the quality and duration of the recorded signals. In this way, HR data from 6 healthy subjects (2 women, 4 men), with median age of 50 years old, were recorded during 15 days, 3 times a day. Recordings were performed in the following situations: both supine and sitting body positions, in the morning, in the afternoon and at night. Data were processed and HRV analysis was performed. Distorting factors affecting HRV have been determined. The most stable HRV indexes (less variation over the days) have also been established. For this task, a variation coefficient was calculated for each parameter, as the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean value. Results indicated that HR data should be recorded in the morning, the sitting position. Related to signals duration, when comparing HR signals, they should be of equal length (same recording time). In addition, HRVi (HRV triangular index) and MADRR (median of the absolute differences between adjacent RR intervals) resulted in the most robust indexes in both low and high frequency domains. For global indexes, the ApEn (approximate entropy) measure emerged as the most stable one. As a conclusion, researchers must be extremely cautious in studies involving HRV analysis; the moment of the day to record data, the body position, or the quality of recorded data will produce different HR signals, and thus, the values of the HRV parameters will be different in each case. This may clearly bias the conclusions of the study.","[Vila, Xose A.; Lado, Maria J.; Cuesta-Morales, P.] Univ Vigo, ESEI, Dept Comp Sci, Campus As Lagoas, Orense 32004, Spain","Lado, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, ESEI, Dept Comp Sci, Campus As Lagoas, Orense 32004, Spain.",mrpepa@uvigo.es,"Lado, María J./F-9196-2011; Cuesta-Morales, Pedro/F-6418-2011","Lado, María J./0000-0002-9027-7788; Cuesta-Morales, Pedro/0000-0003-2523-923X; Vila Sobrino, Xose Anton/0000-0002-8572-1637",,,,35,5,5,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Risk stratification tools have been developed to identify patients at risk for PPCs. While otolaryngology cases were included in the development of common predictive tools, they comprised small percentages in each tool. It is unclear how these tools perform in patients undergoing major head and neck surgery with free flap reconstruction. This retrospective review studied all free flap reconstructions in head and neck surgery over a 12-year period at a single institution in the southeastern US. Baseline demographic and medical information were included for each case. All cases were reviewed for development of major PPCs, including pneumonia and respiratory failure. The cohort underwent risk stratification using the ARISCAT and Gupta pulmonary risk indices. Performance of these predictive models for head and neck surgery was determined through receiver-operator curve comparison. 794 patients were identified with a median age of 62 years (IQR 41-83). Sixty-five percent were male. Forty-three (5.4%) developed pneumonia, 23 patients developed respiratory failure (2.9%), and 38 patients developed both (4.8%), resulting in a total PPC proportion of 13.1% (n = 104). Both ARISCAT and Gupta pulmonary risk indices demonstrated low discrimination to predict PPCs in head and neck free flap reconstruction, with areas under the curve of 0.60 and 0.65, respectively. Two major indices for prediction of postoperative pulmonary complications do not accurately identify risk in patients undergoing major head and neck surgery. Further studies are needed to develop predictive tools for PPCs in this high-risk population.","[Wood, C.

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals may provide a reasonable option for this type of identification due its unique features that overcome the lacks of other common methods. Currently, however, the processing load for such signals requires considerable time and labor. New methods and algorithms have attempted to reduce EEG processing time, including a reduction of the number of electrodes and segmenting the EEG data into its typical frequency bands. This work complements other efforts by proposing a genetic algorithm to reduce the number of necessary electrodes for measurements by EEG devices. Using a public EEG dataset of 109 subjects who underwent relaxation with eye-open and eye-closed stimuli, we aimed to determine the minimum set of electrodes required for optimum identification accuracy in each EEG sub-band of both stimuli. The results were encouraging and it was possible to accurately identify a subject using about 10 out of 64 electrodes. Moreover, higher frequency bands required a fewer number of electrodes for identification compared with lower frequency bands.","[Albasri, Ahmed; Abdali-Mohammadi, Fardin; Fathi, Abdolhossein] Razi Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Technol, Fac Engn, Kermanshah, Iran","Abdali-Mohammadi, F (corresponding author), Razi Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Technol, Fac Engn, Kermanshah, Iran.",fardin.abdali@razi.ac.ir,"Abdali-Mohammadi, Fardin/D-6558-2011; Fathi, Abdolhossein/ABH-8117-2020","Abdali-Mohammadi, Fardin/0000-0002-6691-680X; Albasri, Ahmed/0000-0002-9282-3340",,,,28,15,15,3,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Increasingly the utility of these apps is being explored in healthcare delivery. Hydrocephalus is a condition that is usually followed by a neurosurgeon for the patient's life. We explore patient acceptability of a mobile app as an adjunct to outpatient follow-up of patients with hydrocephalus. A questionnaire was circulated amongst patients with hydrocephalus (adults and children). Patients were asked questions about their hydrocephalus; expectations for outpatient follow up, whether they have smartphone/tablet/internet access and whether they would be interested in a mobile app for their long term hydrocephalus follow up. 191 patients completed questionnaires, 98 respondents were adults (mean age 46.1) and 93 were children less than 18 years old (mean age 8). Overall 36.1% of patients did not know the cause of their hydrocephalus. 96.7% have a shunt. 76.5% of adults and 80.6% of children had 1-4 shunt surgeries, 14.3% of adults and 11.8% of children had 5-9 shunt surgeries, 3.1% of adults and 5.4% of children had 10-14 shunt surgeries. 71.7% of patients expect to be followed-up routinely in clinic for life. All children had smartphones or tablets, compared to 86.7% of adults. Children were more interested in a hydrocephalus app, 84.9% saying yes, compared to 71.4% of adults. Adults who were not interested in the app did not have a smartphone or tablet. Hydrocephalus management is a lifelong task and innovations in technology for engaging patients in its management are vital. The majority of patients are interested in mobile apps for outpatient management of hydrocephalus. We will follow this up with a feasibility study of a custom designed hydrocephalus app.","[Aljaaf, Ahmed J.] Univ Anbar, Ctr Comp, Ramadi, Iraq; [Aljaaf, Ahmed J.; Al-Jumeily, Dhiya; Hussain, Abir] LJMU, Fac Engn, Technol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Van Tonder, Libby; Mallucci, Conor] Alder Hey Childrens Hosp, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Alloghani, Mohamed] Abu Dhabi Hlth Serv Co SEHA, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","Aljaaf, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Anbar, Ctr Comp, Ramadi, Iraq.;Aljaaf, AJ (corresponding author), LJMU, Fac Engn, Technol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",A.J.Aljaaf@uoanbar.edu.iq; Cmallucci@me.com; D.Aljumeily@ljmu.ac.uk; A.Hussain@ljmu.ac.uk; mloghani@seha.ae,"Alloghani, Dr Mohamed Ahmed/AAJ-7651-2020; Al-Jumeily, Dhiya/AAE-8272-2020; Aljaaf, Ahmed J./G-9047-2019","Alloghani, Dr Mohamed Ahmed/0000-0003-3617-0987; Al-Jumeily, Dhiya/0000-0002-9170-0568; Aljaaf, Ahmed J./0000-0001-5072-2464; Mallucci, Conor/0000-0002-5509-0547",,,,25,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The study reports on the characteristics of eHealth applications in Hong Kong information and communication technology (ICT) users, their attitudes towards eHealth, and their reasons for not using eHealth applications. A cross-sectional random-digit dialing survey targeting adults using ICT was conducted in Hong Kong to elicit information on respondents' use of and attitudes towards eHealth. A total of 495 ICT users completed the survey, of whom 353 (71.3%) were eHealth users. A smartphone was the most frequent way of performing eHealth activities (71.7%). The most prevalent eHealth activity was reading about health/illness (86.4%), with 93.5% indicating that eHealth applications improved their understanding of health care issues. People with less education were less likely to use eHealth applications. Non-eHealth users indicated that the main reasons for not using eHealth applications were lack of interest in health information (49.3%) and lack of confidence in the reliability of online information (45.1%). Quality monitoring of health information available on ICTs and tailoring the design and readability are recommended to meet the needs of those seeking health resources and to promote eHealth.

To determine the best method to predict demand for outpatient appointments comparing machine learning and traditional methods, this retrospective study analyzed appointment requests at a major outpatient department in a destination medical center. Two separate locations (A and B) were assessed with 20 traditional, hybrid (traditional + machine learning) and machine learning methods to determine the best forecasting outcome (lowest Forecast Standard Error, FSE). Data characteristics from both datasets were examined. 20 forecasting models were then assessed and compared for the best result. Location A's data displayed a cyclical and non-trending pattern while Location B's displayed a cyclical and trending pattern. Both Location A and B yielded the feature engineered XGBoost model (machine learning) with the lowest out-of-sample FSE. It is important to carefully analyze and understand the underlying data set pattern and then test a variety of traditional, machine learning, and hybrid prediction methods to achieve optimal predictive results.

Firstly, the improved wavelet denoising method was used for signal preprocessing. Then, the logistic regression based hidden semi-Markov model algorithm was utilized to locate the boundary of the first HS and the second HS, therefore, the ratio of diastolic to systolic duration can be calculated. Eleven features were extracted based on multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis to analyze the differences of multifractal behavior of HS between healthy people and HFpEF patients. Afterwards, the statistical analysis was implemented on the extracted HS characteristics to generate the diagnostic feature set. Finally, the extreme learning machine was applied for HFpEF identification by the comparison of performances with support vector machine.

The images are received by the detector and this can be degraded by several factors like atmospherical things and device noises which emit temperature noise, processing noise and explosion noise. There are several strategies are developed already to cut back the signal to noise magnitude relation of the hyperspectral image. However, the stationary noise of the many denoising ways developed cannot be applied on to the gauge boson noise. Thus, the each gauge boson and thermal noise square measure gift within the captured hyperspectral image (HSI). during this paper, we tend to projected a replacement denoising framework known as tensor-based filtering employing a PARAFAC tensor decomposition methodology for scale back each noise. The proposed technique is performs higher in removing noise as compared with different strategies like Multiple linear regression (MLR) algorithm and combined algorithm called multidimensional wavelet transforms with multiway wiener filter (MWPT-MWF) technique. The performance analysis of the new denoising framework has more efficient for reducing signal dependent (PN) and signal independent noise (TN) as compared with other conventional method.

It is either diagnosed malignant or benign - depending upon the severity of the infection and the current stage. The conventional methods require a detailed physical inspection by an expert dermatologist, which is time-consuming and imprecise. Therefore, several computer vision methods are introduced lately, which are cost-effective and somewhat accurate. In this work, we propose a new automated approach for skin lesion detection and recognition using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). The proposed cascaded design incorporates three fundamental steps including; a) contrast enhancement through fast local Laplacian filtering (FlLpF) along HSV color transformation; b) lesion boundary extraction using color CNN approach by following XOR operation; c) in-depth features extraction by applying transfer learning using Inception V3 model prior to feature fusion using hamming distance (HD) approach. An entropy controlled feature selection method is also introduced for the selection of the most discriminant features. The proposed method is tested on PH2 and ISIC 2017 datasets, whereas the recognition phase is validated on PH2, ISBI 2016, and ISBI 2017 datasets. From the results, it is concluded that the proposed method outperforms several existing methods and attained accuracy 98.4% on PH2 dataset, 95.1% on ISBI dataset and 94.8% on ISBI 2017 dataset.","[Saba, Tanzila; Marie-Sainte, Souad Larabi] Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia; [Khan, Muhammad Attique] HITEC Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Museum Rd, Taxila, Pakistan; [Rehman, Amjad] Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Saba, T (corresponding author), Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia.",drtsaba@gmail.com,"Khan, Muhammad Attique Attique/AAX-2644-2021; Saba, Tanzila/D-4593-2018","Khan, Muhammad Attique Attique/0000-0002-6347-4890; Saba, Tanzila/0000-0003-3138-3801",research Project [Skin Cancer Melanoma Detection from Dermoscopic Images Using Machine Learning Techniques]; Prince Sultan University; Saudi Arabia [SSP -18-5-04]; Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) Lab Prince Sultan University Riyadh Saudi Arabia,"This work was supported by the research Project [Skin Cancer Melanoma Detection from Dermoscopic Images Using Machine Learning Techniques]; Prince Sultan University; Saudi Arabia [SSP -18-5-04] Additionally, in part supported by Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) Lab Prince Sultan University Riyadh Saudi Arabia.

However, in the current medical data management, it is difficult to share medical data due to the fragmentation of medical data and the lack of effective sharing methods. On the other hand, the security of medical data is difficult to protect because the centralized data storage is vulnerable to attack and tampering. Therefore, we propose a model called Med-PPPHIS, which consists of a permission-less blockchain and a permissioned blockchain, named Med-DLattice, to serve the management of user's personal health information and form a chained protection mechanism for medical data. Med-DLattice features Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, where each account updates its Account-DAG asynchronously to other unrelated accounts. The Med-DLattice nodes can reach an efficient consensus with proposed DPoS-Quorum algorithm. Based on this model, by converting the medical data into on-chain tokens, a safe and efficient channel for data circulation is established, while the privacy of data is secured. We implement a prototype of Med-PPPHIS and introduce a blockchain-based closed-loop method for chronic disease management, which initially applies the model to national physique monitoring in Anhui Province, China.

Since the DTI data is a tensor space, its segmentation is different from ordinary MRI images. Based on the existing deep learning model, an improved image semantic segmentation method based on super-pixels and conditional random field is proposed. Firstly, this paper uses the existing feature extraction model based on deep learning to obtain rough semantic segmentation results, including high-level semantic information of the image but lacking details of the image. In addition, the super-pixel segmentation algorithm is implemented to obtain super-pixels that carries more low-level information. Secondly, due to the lack of image details in rough segmentation results, the segmentation of the edge of the image is inaccurate. In this paper, a boundary optimization algorithm is proposed to optimize the edge segmentation accuracy of the rough results. Finally, the use of super-pixels for local boundary optimization can improve the segmentation accuracy.

The method utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for classification with several feature extraction techniques. MRI is a non-invasive procedure, widely adopted in hospitals to examine cognitive abnormalities. Images are acquired using the T2 imaging sequence. The paradigm consists of a series of quantitative techniques: filtering, feature extraction, Student's t-test based feature selection, and k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) based classification. Additionally, a comparative analysis is done by implementing other feature extraction procedures that are described in the literature. Our findings suggest that the Shearlet Transform (ST) feature extraction technique offers improved results for Alzheimer's diagnosis as compared to alternative methods. The proposed CABD tool with the ST + KNN technique provided accuracy of 94.54%, precision of 88.33%, sensitivity of 96.30% and specificity of 93.64%. Furthermore, this tool also offered an accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity of 98.48%, 100%, 96.97% and 100%, respectively, with the benchmark MRI database.","[Acharya, U.

In this work, an algorithmic approach is proposed to detect the lung oblique fissures from lung computed tomography (CT) images. In the preprocessing module of our approach, the lung structures are enhanced using morphological operation and lung images are de-noised using Wiener filter. In the second module, lung regions are segmented using techniques, namely, thresholding and background subtraction. In the third module of our algorithm, initially, fissure regions are segmented using the active contour model, then by applying the rule based approach on the fissure regions, the oblique fissures are segmented. The proposed algorithm has been tested on 50 images collected from Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and 30 images obtained from Early Lung Cancer Action Program (ELCAP).","[Anitha, S.; Babu, T.

In this paper, the impulse noise and Rician noise in the medical MR images are removed by using Bilateral Filter (BF). The novel approaches are presented in this paper; Enhanced grasshopper optimization algorithm (EGOA) is used to optimize the BF parameters. To simulate the medical MR images (with different variances), the impulse and Rician noises are added. The EGOA is applied to the noisy image in searching regions of window size, spatial and intensity domain to obtain the filter parameters optimally. The PSNR is taken as fitness value for optimization. We examined the proposed technique results with other MR images After the optimal parameters assurance. In order to comprehend the BF parameters selection importance, the results of proposed denoising method is contrasted with other previously used BFs, genetic algorithm (GA), gravitational search algorithm (GSA) using the quality metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), structural similarity index metric (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), and PSNR. The outcome shows that the EOGA method with BF shows good results than the earlier methods in both edge preservation and noise elimination from medical MR images.

This involves evaluating the usage pattern and trails of the customer left as a log, deriving pattern from click stream etc. However, the cutting edge technology applied by the big healthcare E-Commerce industries like private Cloud utilization (John et al., Optimization and Computing, 2012), web content mining enables them to attract and retain innumerable number of customers even during peak hours. According to the research carried out in this paper, there are two distinct types of online business based on web content promoted towards buy, they are classified as exhaustive promote and partial promote. Typically exhaustive promote website perform even complex web mining operations for identifying and enticing the potential customers to buy various healthcare products based on various factors such as buying habits, interests etc. However for the partial promote in the observed cases, they are not even aware of the existence of such techniques. Based on the analysis performed on various renounced online websites, if 60% and above of the web content leads the customer to perform the buy, then it is exhaustive promote the rest is considered as partial promote. Moreover a huge gap is observed between Partial and exhaustive promote when it comes to the deployment of the web mining techniques. Consequently to understand the varying role of web mining in the online business successes, this paper models the web mining as a Game in Cournot Model. The results show that the model suits the economics behind the online businesses in both the cases and thus helps to identify or enhance the underlying web mining techniques towards business success.","[Damodharan, P.] Akshaya Coll Engn & Technol, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Ravichandran, C.

In Iran, most outpatient clinics and our study population suffer from high patient' no-show rate and long waiting times because of not using online appointment scheduling system. In this study, the effect of an online appointment scheduling system was investigated by comparing the evaluation metrics of appointment scheduling before and after the intervention. This before-after pilot study was conducted on ten outpatient clinics with different specializations. Five clinics were selected as the intervention group and five clinics as the control group. A checklist was designed to evaluate appointment scheduling metrics. These checklists were completed from April to July 2017 in the pre-implementation phase and from September to December 2017 in the post-implementation phase. The evaluation metrics were evaluated before and after the implementation of the online appointment scheduling system. A total of 470 checklists containing 9034 patients' information and 460 checklists containing 9130 patients' information were completed at the pre- and post-implementation phases, respectively. There were significant positive effect on the improvement of the three metrics means, including Patient waiting time (38.2min before vs. 23.8min after the intervention), No-show rate (25% before vs. 11% after the intervention), and Physician punctuality (-30min before vs. -14.2min after the intervention).

Thirty COPD and 25 healthy subject data are recorded. Total of 39 lung sound features and 3 spirometry features are extracted and evaluated. Various parametric and nonparametric tests are conducted to evaluate the relevance of extracted features. Classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), decision tree and discriminant analysis (DA) are used to categorize normal and COPD breath sounds. Classification based on spirometry parameters as well as respiratory sound parameters are assessed. Maximum classification accuracy of 83.6% is achieved by the SVM classifier while using the most relevant lung sound parameters i.e. median frequency and linear predictive coefficients. Further, SVM classifier and LR classifier achieved classification accuracy of 100% when relevant lung sound parameters, i.e. median frequency and linear predictive coefficient are combined with the spirometry parameters, i.e. forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1). It is concluded that combining lung sound based features with spirometry data can improve the accuracy of COPD diagnosis and hence the clinician's performance in routine clinical practice. The proposed approach is of great significance in a clinical scenario wherein it can be used to assist clinicians for automated COPD diagnosis. A complete handheld medical system can be developed in the future incorporating lung sounds for COPD diagnosis using machine learning techniques.","[Haider, Nishi Shahnaj; Singh, Bikesh Kumar] NIT Raipur, Biomed, GE Rd, Raipur 492010, Madhya Pradesh, India; [Periyasamy, R.] NIT Tiruchirappall, Dept Instrumentat & Control Engn, Tiruchirappall 620015, Tamil Nadu, India; [Behera, Ajoy K.] AIIMS Raipur, Dept Pulm Med, GE Rd, Raipur 492010, Madhya Pradesh, India","Singh, BK (corresponding author), NIT Raipur, Biomed, GE Rd, Raipur 492010, Madhya Pradesh, India.",bsingh.bme@nitrr.ac.in,"Singh, Bikesh Kumar/AAT-2203-2020; Haider, Nishi Shahnaj/AAU-7385-2021; R, Periyasamy/AAY-7571-2021","Haider, Nishi Shahnaj/0000-0002-4486-2409; Singh, Bikesh Kumar/0000-0002-5052-9768",,,,34,11,12,3,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

We used Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) medical data sets from the UCI machine learning repository. The proposed method is assessed using various performance indices like true classification accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, recall, precision, f measure, and MCC. Simulation and result proved that the proposed approach gives better results in terms of different parameters. The prediction results obtained by the proposed approach were very promising (98.60% true accuracy). In addition, the proposed method outperforms the Stacked Sparse Autoencoders and Softmax Regression based (SSAE-SM) model and other State-of-the-art classifiers in terms of various performance indices.

However, most multi-atlas-based methods depend on the registration that may not give the correct information during the label propagation. To address the issue, we designed a new automatic labeling method through the hashing retrieval based atlas forest. The proposed method propagates labels without registration to reduce the errors, and constructs a target-oriented learning model to integrate information among the atlases. This method innovates a coarse classification strategy to preprocess the dataset, which retains the integrity of dataset and reduces computing time. Furthermore, the method considers each voxel in the atlas as a sample and encodes these samples with hashing for the fast sample retrieval. In the stage of labeling, the method selects suitable samples through hashing learning and trains atlas forests by integrating the information from the dataset. Then, the trained model is used to predict the labels of the target. Experimental results on two datasets illustrated that the proposed method is promising in the automatic labeling of MR brain images.","[Liu, Hong; Xu, Lijun; Song, Enmin; Jin, Renchao] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Hung, Chih-Cheng] Kennesaw State Univ, Marietta, GA USA","Song, EM (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",enmin_song@126.com,"Jin, Renchao/F-4880-2018","Jin, Renchao/0000-0002-1591-3510",National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0112804],This study was funded by National Key R&D Program of China(2017YFC0112804).,,33,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The main objective of HelPath is to continuously collect user's information that, complemented with data from the electronic health record, supports the identification of risks associated with suicidality. Through the virtual agent, the users also receive information and suggestions based on cognitive behaviour therapy that would help them to maintain a healthy condition. The paper also presents the execution of an exploratory pilot to assess the acceptability, perception and adherence of users towards the virtual agent. The obtained results are presented and discussed, and some actions for further improvement of the embodied conversational agent are also identified.","[Martinez-Miranda, Juan] CONACYT, Ctr Invest Cient & Educ Super Ensenada, Unidad Transferencia Tecnol, Tepic, Mexico; [Martinez, Ariadna; Aguilar, Hector; Jimenez, Liliana; Valencia, Elizabeth] Serv Salud Nayarit, Tepic, Mexico; [Ramos, Roberto; Rosales, Giovanni] Ctr Invest Cient & Educ Super Ensenada, Unidad Transferencia Tecnol, Tepic, Mexico; [Arias, Hodwar] Univ Vizcaya, Tepic, Mexico","Martinez-Miranda, J (corresponding author), CONACYT, Ctr Invest Cient & Educ Super Ensenada, Unidad Transferencia Tecnol, Tepic, Mexico.",jmiranda@cicese.mx,"Martínez-Miranda, Juan/ABB-7942-2020","Martínez-Miranda, Juan/0000-0001-5081-8212",Mexican National Research Council (CONACyT) [2016-1-273163],This study was funded by the Mexican National Research Council (CONACyT grant number 2016-1-273163).,,63,17,17,4,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

A phenomenal feature termed as Predictability' helps in predicting and portraying related data to the user according to their needs. Moreover, classification of Big Data is usually a tedious and lengthy task. The technique of MapReduce Framework performs the data processing that being paralleled by data distribution in small chunks through the clusters. This Map Reduce technique is being proposed which is employed to process heterogeneous data items. Few issues that are being targeted in the existing paper include associating climatologically and meteorological information with large variety of farming decisions. Using the well-known MapReduce framework the above issues and challenges can be resolved. The existing paper proposes empirical techniques of climate classification and prediction by adopting Co-EANFS (Co-Effective and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy System) approach for data handling. Furthermore, the paper examines association rule mining too, which is being implemented for examining the best crop production by relying upon the soil and weather condition. Lastly, a technique is proposed for managing various levels such as preprocessing, clustering, classification and prediction. First, the weather dataset is being collected which undergoes processing; thereafter the proposed model is implemented which results in formation of cluster data sets linked to each season. For evaluating the performance, accuracy predictions generated by Co-EANFS is used which being formulated with varying no: of inputs and variables. The proposed framework acquires least execution time.","[Meena, K.] Vel Tech Rangarajan Dr Sagunthala R&D Inst Sci &, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Sujatha, J.] Vel Tech Rangarajan Dr Sagunthala R&D Inst Sci &, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","Meena, K (corresponding author), Vel Tech Rangarajan Dr Sagunthala R&D Inst Sci &, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.",meen.nandhu@gmail.com; jsujathacse@gmail.com,,,,,,18,4,5,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Classification of these neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) is clinically important to analyze the destruction of nerve cells. Early diagnosis of NDD'S helps in saving the human life. Based on the report of previous studies, motor impairment or human gait cycle is largely affected by the clinical symptoms of NDD. Accurate diagnosis of various neurodegenerative diseases in correct time is very important for early diagnosis of the disease. Diseases can be diagnosed earlier by means of characterizing the gait cycle. In this work, a gait dynamics classification method is proposed for determining the neurodegenerative diseases from the brain signals using multilevel feature extraction method. From force sensitive resistors, the left and right feet signals recorded in 60 one minute are included in the input database. It is obtained through fixing 16 healthy subjects, 13 ALS, 20 HD, and 15 PD. Using six levels of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), the features are determined by means of decomposing the raw signal. Ultimately, the pathological gait signals are classified through exploiting three multilevel feature extraction techniques named as, (Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), Positive, Negative Peak Histogram Analysis (PNPHA) (proposed Method) and Statistical Temporal parameter Analysis (STA)). Experimental outcomes proved that the gait dynamics are successively distinguished between NDD and group of healthy controls using the proposed method.","[Mole, S. S.

We obtained data from 2344 ACS patients, who required revascularization and from 3538 non-ACS patients. We analyzed 20 features that are relevant to ACS using standard algorithms, support vector machines and linear discriminant analysis. Based on feature pattern and filter characteristics, we analyzed and extracted a strong prediction function out of the 20 selected features. The obtained prediction functions are relevant showing the area under curve of 0.860 for the prediction of ACS that requiring revascularization. Some features are missing in many data though they are considered to be very informative; it turned out that omitting those features from the input and using more data without those features for training improves the prediction accuracy. Additionally, from the investigation using the receiver operating characteristic curves, a reliable prediction of 2.60% of non-ACS patients could be made with a specificity of 1.0. For those 2.60% non-ACS patients, we can consider the recommendation of medical treatment without risking misdiagnosis of the patients requiring revascularization. We investigated prediction algorithm to select ACS patients requiring revascularization and non-ACS patients presenting angina-like symptoms at an early stage. In the future, a large cohort study is necessary to increase the prediction accuracy and confirm the possibility of safely discriminating the non-ACS patients from the ACS patients with confidence.","[Noh, Yung-Kyun] Hanyang Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 04763, South Korea; [Park, Ji Young] Eulji Univ, Nowon Eulji Hosp, Div Cardiol, 68 Hangeulbiseok Ro, Seoul 01830, South Korea; [Choi, Byoung Geol; Rha, Seung-Woon] Korea Univ, Guro Hosp, Cardiovasc Ctr, 148 Gurodong Ro, Seoul 08308, South Korea; [Kim, Kee-Eung] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Comp, 291 Daehak Ro, Daejeon 34141, South Korea","Rha, SW (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Guro Hosp, Cardiovasc Ctr, 148 Gurodong Ro, Seoul 08308, South Korea.",nohyung@hanyang.ac.kr; cisamoe74@eulji.ac.kr; trv940@korea.ac.kr; kekim@cs.kaist.ac.kr; swrha617@yahoo.co.kr,"Rha, Seung-Woon/AGE-5810-2022","Rha, Seung-Woon/0000-0001-9456-9852; Choi, Byoung Geol/0000-0002-6090-869X",EMBRI Grants from the Eulji University [2017SN0002]; National Research Foundation of Korea - Korea government [NRF/MSIT-2017R1E1A1A03070945],This research was supported by EMBRI Grants 2017SN0002 from the Eulji University and partly supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant NRF/MSIT-2017R1E1A1A03070945 funded by the Korea government.,,21,6,6,1,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The security level of the contents that are stored in the cloud can be guaranteed by focusing on a task that helps in both securing and verifying the data.

The classifier was developed and validated using a reference dataset with consensus manual segmentation of fibroglandular tissue. Accuracy was evaluated at the pixel-level to examine how well the algorithm identified pixels with fibroglandular tissue using true and false positive fractions (TPF and FPF, respectively). Quantitative estimates of the patient-level CT percent density were contrasted to each other using the concordance correlation coefficient, (c), and to subjective ACR BI-RADS density assessments using Kendall's (b).

An effective segmentation, edge detection and intensity enhancement can detect brain tumor easily. For that, active contour with level set method has been utilized. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated in terms of white pixels, black pixels, tumor detected area, and the processing time. This technique can deal with a higher number of segmentation problem and minimum execution time by ensuring segmentation quality. Additionally, tumor area length in vertical and horizontal positions is determined to measure sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and similarity index values. Further, tumor volume is computed. Knowledge of the information of tumor is helpful for the physicians for effective diagnosing in tumor for treatments. The entire experimentation was implemented in MATLAB environment and simulation results were compared with existing approaches.","[Rajan, P.

Microarray data classification plays an important role in cancer treatment. An efficient gene selection technique to select the more promising genes is necessary for cancer classification. Here, we propose a Two-stage MI-GA Gene Selection algorithm for selecting informative genes in cancer data classification. In the first stage, Mutual Information based gene selection is applied which selects only the genes that have high information related to the cancer. The genes which have high mutual information value are given as input to the second stage. The Genetic Algorithm based gene selection is applied in the second stage to identify and select the optimal set of genes required for accurate classification. For classification, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used.

It can be based on various criteria such as face image, DNA methylation, chest plate radiographs, knee radiographs, dental images and etc. Most of the age prediction researches have mainly been based on images. Since the image processing and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have grown up, the investigations were led to use them in age prediction problem. The implementations would be used in different fields, especially in medical applications. Brain Age Estimation (BAE) has attracted more attention in recent years and it would be so helpful in early diagnosis of some neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, etc. BAE is performed on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images to compute the brain ages. Studies based on brain MRI shows that there is a relation between accelerated aging and accelerated brain atrophy. This refers to the effects of neurodegenerative diseases on brain structure while making the whole of it older. This paper reviews and summarizes the main approaches for age prediction based on brain MRI images including preprocessing methods, useful tools used in different research works and the estimation algorithms. We categorize the BAE methods based on two factors, first the way of processing MRI images, which includes pixel-based, surface-based, or voxel-based methods and second, the generation of ML algorithms that includes traditional or Deep Learning (DL) methods. The modern techniques as DL methods help MRI based age prediction to get results that are more accurate. In recent years, more precise and statistical ML approaches have been utilized with the help of related tools for simplifying computations and getting accurate results. Pros and cons of each research and the challenges in each work are expressed and some guidelines and deliberations for future research are suggested.","[Sajedi, Hedieh; Pardakhti, Nastaran] Univ Tehran, Coll Sci, Sch Math Stat & Comp Sci, Tehran, Iran; [Sajedi, Hedieh] Inst Res Fundamental Sci IPM, Sch Comp Sci, POB 19395-5746, Tehran, Iran","Sajedi, H (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Coll Sci, Sch Math Stat & Comp Sci, Tehran, Iran.;Sajedi, H (corresponding author), Inst Res Fundamental Sci IPM, Sch Comp Sci, POB 19395-5746, Tehran, Iran.",hhsajedi@ut.ac.ir; n.pardakhti@ut.ac.ir,,"sajedi, hedieh/0000-0003-4782-9222",IPM [CS1398-4-69],This research was in part supported by a grant from IPM (No. CS1398-4-69).,,115,20,20,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

This is a manual procedure, so it causes subjectivity and variability in the IMT classification. Instead, this article proposes a methodology based on artificial intelligence methods for IMT classification. For this purpose, a deep learning strategy with multiple hidden layers has been developed. In order to create the proposed model, convolutional neural network algorithm, which is frequently used in image classification problems, is used. 501 ultrasound images from 153 patients were used to test the model. The images are classified by two specialists, then the model is trained and tested on the images, and the results are explained. The deep learning model in the study achieved an accuracy of 89.1% in the IMT classification with 89% sensitivity and 88% specificity.

These include joint replacement procedures, and in order to reduce patient anxiety, the supervising anaesthetist delivers the sedative propofol intravenously using a target-controlled infusion (TCI) device. However, it is clinically challenging to judge the required effect-site concentration of sedative for an individual patient, resulting in patient care issues related to over or under-sedation. To improve the process, patient-maintained propofol sedation (PMPS), where the patient can request an increase in concentration through a hand-held button, has been considered as an alternative. However, due to the proprietary nature of modern TCI pumps, the majority of PMPS research has been conducted using prototypes in research studies. In this work, a PMPS system is presented that effectively converts a standard infusion pump into a TCI device using a laptop with TCI software. Functionally, the system delivers sedation analogous to a modern TCI pump, with the differences in propofol consumption and dosage within the tolerance of clinically approved devices. Therefore, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved the system as a safe alternative to anaesthetist-controlled TCI procedures. It represents a step forward in the consideration of PMPS as a sedation method as viable alternative, allowing further assessment in clinical trials.","[Sprinks, James; Worcester, Frank; Breedon, Philip; Watts, Paul] Nottingham Trent Univ, Med Engn Design Res Grp, Nottingham, England; [Hewson, David; Bedforth, Nigel] Nottingham Univ Hosp NHS Trust, Dept Anaesthesia & Crit Care, Nottingham, England","Breedon, P (corresponding author), Nottingham Trent Univ, Med Engn Design Res Grp, Nottingham, England.",philip.breedon@ntu.ac.uk,"Sprinks, James/AAO-6983-2021","Sprinks, James/0000-0003-3781-5484",UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Invention for Innovation Award [II-LA-0716-20002],This work is funded by a UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Invention for Innovation Award (Reference II-LA-0716-20002).,,31,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Invited women also need to be able to contact screening programs to get further information on screening procedures and/or cancel and reschedule appointments. This study describes the communication channels used by women invited for breast cancer screening to contact the program. The study population consisted of 141,684 women, aged 50-69years, who were invited during 2015-2016 for screening by the Catalan Breast Cancer Screening Program (Spain). Multiple logistic regression models were performed to assess the association between age, screening history, socioeconomic status and reasons for contacting the program and the outcome variables (contact with the program; contact through information and communication technology (ICT) channels). Among the 141,684 women invited for BC screening, 22.5% contacted the screening office mainly to reschedule (42.2%) and cancel (29.2%) appointments. While the communication channel mostly used was the telephone, 24.8% of the women used ICT. ICT was more frequently used by women who had never been screened. Women who wanted to change their appointment were 65% (OR 1.65, 95%CI 1.54-1.76) more likely to use ICT than women who wanted to cancel it. This study showed the need to reinforce communication between women and breast cancer screening programs and the importance of offering communication channels suiting all women's needs to facilitate appointments' rescheduling and cancelling and therefore improve screening programs' efficiency.","[Travier, Noemie; Vidal, Carmen; Garcia, Montse; Benito, Llucia; Medina, Pilar] IDIBELL, Catalan Inst Oncol, Canc Prevent & Control Program, Av Gran Via 199-203, Barcelona 08908, Spain; [Garcia, Montse] Consortium Biomed Res Epidemiol & Publ Hlth CIBER, Madrid, Spain; [Benito, Llucia] Univ Barcelona, Dept Fundamental Care & Med Surg Nursing, Barcelona, Spain; [Moreno, Victor] ONCOBELL, Catalan Inst Oncol, Oncol Data Analyt Program, Av Gran Via 199-203, Barcelona 08908, Spain; [Moreno, Victor] Univ Barcelona, Dept Clin Sci, Barcelona, Spain","Garcia, M (corresponding author), IDIBELL, Catalan Inst Oncol, Canc Prevent & Control Program, Av Gran Via 199-203, Barcelona 08908, Spain.;Garcia, M (corresponding author), Consortium Biomed Res Epidemiol & Publ Hlth CIBER, Madrid, Spain.",mgarcia@iconcologia.net,"Benito, Llucia/AAK-5133-2020; Medina, Pilar/ABB-7244-2021; Moreno, Victor/A-1697-2010; Garcia, Montse/B-8832-2014; Vidal, Carmen/H-4029-2016","Benito, Llucia/0000-0002-9956-3633; Medina, Pilar/0000-0001-9637-5998; Moreno, Victor/0000-0002-2818-5487; Garcia, Montse/0000-0002-3437-3185; Vidal, Carmen/0000-0003-2768-2710",,,,13,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The texture patterns from finger knuckle are extracted using Gabor with Exception-Maximization (EM) algorithm and the feature vectors from these texture patterns are acquired using Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm. The main focus is to reduce the false rejection rate without increasing the false acceptance rate and to improve the performance over the conventional hand based modalities. The performance is compared with Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR). One of the advantages of FKP authentication is its user friendliness in data collection.","[Vidhyapriya, R.] PSG Coll Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Rose, Lovelyn S.] PSG Coll Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India","Vidhyapriya, R (corresponding author), PSG Coll Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.",rvidhyapriya@gmail.com; slr.cse@psgtech.ac.in,,"Ranganathan, Vidhyapriya/0000-0003-0665-6820; rose, lovelyn/0000-0003-3854-4495",,,,8,9,9,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Multiple Agents have been used to analyse the blogs by dividing the work areas and communicating themselves using Agent Communication Language (ACL) and FIPA. The local solutions thus formed are forwarded to a global agent. This Global Agent controls all operations and makes the decision about the best solution. As the Global Agent controls all other agents, it eradicates unwanted and ineffective communication between the various local agents and hence keeping the time taken for communication at the minimum level. Based on these solutions a prioritization matrix is formed using advanced clustering techniques to create a prioritized content of suggested best solutions. Once the decision is made, the refining process runs several times recursively checking for all possible better solutions solving the input. On completion of this process, the Global Agent returns the exact result of the discussion. This process saves time rather than researching the entire blog for result data.

A traditional saliency cervical cancer detection method in Ultrasound image, assuming that there is only one salient object, is not conductive to practical application. Their effects are dependent on saliency threshold. Object detection model provides a kind of new solutions for multiple salient objects. Shot multiBox detector can accurately detect multi-objects with different scales simultaneously except for small cervical cancer regions. To overcome this drawback, this paper presents a new multi-saliency objects detection model, appending deconvolution module embedded within attention residual module. Experiments show that our proposed diagnosis algorithm achieves higher detection accuracy than comparison algorithms. Also, it improves detection performance for mult-saliency cervical cancer objects with small scales, which greatly improve the diagnosis accuracy of cervical cancer.","[Wei, Shuli; Dai, Peifeng; Wang, Zhengping] Weifang Peoples Hosp, Dept Ultrasonog, Weifang 261041, Shandong, Peoples R China","Wang, ZP (corresponding author), Weifang Peoples Hosp, Dept Ultrasonog, Weifang 261041, Shandong, Peoples R China.",wangzhengping80@126.com,,,,,,24,1,1,2,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

According to clinical studies, dimethyl-biguanide hydrochloride (DMBG) reduces the urinary protein level in patients with diabetic nephropathy to protect the kidney, but the specific renoprotective mechanism remains unclear. In this study, the application of DMBG partially alleviates the pathological changes in the kidneys of db/db mice, increases the level of the klotho protein in the blood, urine and kidney tissues of the mice, and reduces the levels of the mTOR and p-mTOR proteins. The effects of high glucose and DMBG on klotho and the mTOR pathway in MDCK cells were analyzed at the cellular level. High glucose stimulation activates mTOR pathway and decreases the activity of MDCK cells. DMBG decreases the level of the mTOR protein and reverses the effect of hyperglycaemic stimulation on the activity of MDCK cells. After inhibiting the expression of the klotho protein, DMBG is unable to decrease the level of the mTOR protein.

They provide the doctors with access to electronic medical records with the aid of medical sensors, smart wearable devices and smart medical instruments. Although SCHSs have many applications in the area of health care, securing massive amount of valuable and sensitive data of the patients and preserving the privacy are challenging. User authentication based on public key cryptographic techniques is playing a crucial role in SCHSs for protecting the privacy of patients. However, quantum computers will break such techniques. Rainbow signature is one of the candidates of the next generation of cryptographic algorithms which can resist attacks on quantum computers. However, it is vulnerable to Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attacks, which is based on information gained from the cryptographic implementations. We present techniques to exploit the countermeasures to protect Rainbow against DPA attacks. We propose a variant of Rainbow with resistance to DPA attacks.

However, the nature of ovarian cysts lacks accurate judgement, leading to that many patients with benign nodules still need Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsies or surgeries, increasing the physical pain and mental pressure of patients as well as unnecessary medical health care costs. Therefore, we present an image diagnosis system for classifying the ovarian cysts in color ultrasound images, which novelly applies the image features fused by both high-level features from deep learning network and low-level features from texture descriptor. Firstly, the ultrasound images are enhanced to improve the quality of training data set and the rotation invariant uniform local binary pattern (ULBP) features are extracted from each of the images as the low-level texture features. Then the high-level deep features extracted by the fine-tuned GoogLeNet neural network and the low-level ULBP features are normalized and cascaded as one fusion feature that can represent both the semantic context and the texture patterns distributed in the image. Finally, the fusion features are input to the Cost-sensitive Random Forest classifier to classify the images into malignant and benign. The high-level features extracted by the deep neural network from the medical ultrasound image can reflect the visual features of the lesion region, while the low-level texture features can describe the edges, direction and distribution of intensities. Experimental results indicate that the combination of the two types of features can describe the differences between the lesion regions and other regions, and the differences between lesions regions of malignant and benign ovarian cysts.","[Zhang, Lei; Huang, Jian; Liu, Li] Tianjin Cent Hosp Gynecol Obstet, Ultrasound Ctr, Tianjin 300052, Peoples R China","Liu, L (corresponding author), Tianjin Cent Hosp Gynecol Obstet, Ultrasound Ctr, Tianjin 300052, Peoples R China.",liliu_dsj10@163.com,,,,,,36,19,23,5,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

For high degree malignant skin tumors, if not detected in time, they can do serious harm to patients' health. However, in clinical practice, identifying malignant degree requires biopsy and pathological examination which is time costly. Furthermore, in many areas, due to the severe shortage of dermatologists, it's inconvenient for patients to go to hospital for examination. Therefore, an easy to access screening method of malignant skin tumors is needed urgently. Firstly, we spend 5years to build a dataset which includes 4,500 images of 10 kinds of skin tumors. All instances are verified pathologically thus trustworthy; Secondly, we label each instance to be either low-risk, high-risk or dangerous in which Junctional nevus, Intradermal nevus, Dermatofibroma, Lipoma and Seborrheic keratosis are low-risk, Basal cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease and Actinic keratosis are high-risk, Squamous cell carcinoma and Malignant melanoma are dangerous; Thirdly, we apply the Xception architecture to build the risk degree classifier. The area under the curve (AUC) for three risk degrees reach 0.959, 0.919 and 0.947 respectively. To further evaluate the validity of the proposed risk degree classifier, we conduct a competition with 20 professional dermatologists. The results showed the proposed classifier outperforms dermatologists. Our system is helpful to patients in preliminary screening. It can identify the patients who are at risk and alert them to go to hospital for further examination.","[Zhao, Xin-yu; Li, Yi; He, Xiao-yu; Wu, Zhe; Xie, Bin] Cent S Univ, Sch Automat, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xian; Fan, Wei] Tencent Med AI Lab, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Fang-fang; Huang, Kai; Chen, Ming-liang; Li, Jie; Luo, Zhong-ling; Su, Juan; Zhao, Shuang] Cent S Univ, Xiangya Hosp, Dept Dermatol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Li, Fang-fang; Huang, Kai; Chen, Ming-liang; Li, Jie; Luo, Zhong-ling; Su, Juan; Zhao, Shuang] Hunan Key Lab Skin Canc & Psoriasis, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Li, Fang-fang; Huang, Kai; Chen, Ming-liang; Li, Jie; Luo, Zhong-ling; Su, Juan; Zhao, Shuang] Hunan Engn Res Ctr Skin Hlth & Dis, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Wei-hong] Cent S Univ, Xiangya Hosp, Mobile Hlth Minist Educ, China Mobile Joint Lab, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China","Xie, B (corresponding author), Cent S Univ, Sch Automat, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.;Zhao, S (corresponding author), Cent S Univ, Xiangya Hosp, Dept Dermatol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.;Zhao, S (corresponding author), Hunan Key Lab Skin Canc & Psoriasis, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.;Zhao, S (corresponding author), Hunan Engn Res Ctr Skin Hlth & Dis, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",xiebin@csu.edu.cn; shuangxy@csu.edu.cn,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC0117000]; Specialized Basic Work of Science and Technology [2015FY111100]; Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Department [2018SK2092],"This research was funded by National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC0117000), Specialized Basic Work of Science and Technology (2015FY111100) and Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Department (2018SK2092).",,21,11,12,5,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

This study mainly concentrates on common and plantar warts. There are various treatment methods for this disease, including the popular immunotherapy and cryotherapy methods. Manual evaluation of the WD treatment response is challenging. Furthermore, traditional machine learning methods are not robust enough in WD classification as they cannot deal effectively with small number of attributes. This study proposes a new evolutionary-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system using machine learning to classify the WD treatment response. The main architecture of our CAD system is based on the combination of improved adaptive particle swarm optimization (IAPSO) algorithm and artificial immune recognition system (AIRS). The cross-validation protocol was applied to test our machine learning-based classification system, including five different partition protocols (K2, K3, K4, K5 and K10). Our database consisted of 180 records taken from immunotherapy and cryotherapy databases. The best results were obtained using the K10 protocol that provided the precision, recall, F-measure and accuracy values of 0.8908, 0.8943, 0.8916 and 90%, respectively. Our IAPSO system showed the reliability of 98.68%. It was implemented in Java, while integrated development environment (IDE) was implemented using NetBeans. Our encouraging results suggest that the proposed IAPSO-AIRS system can be employed for the WD management in clinical environment.","[Abdar, Moloud; Makarenkov, Vladimir] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Informat, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Wijayaningrum, Vivi Nur] Politekn Negeri Malang, Dept Informat Technol, Malang, East Java, Indonesia; [Hussain, Sadiq] Dibrugarh Univ, Dibrugarh, Assam, India; [Alizadehsani, Roohallah] Deakin Univ, IISRI, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Plawiak, Pawel] Cracow Univ Technol, Inst Telecomp, Fac Phys Math & Comp Sci, Krakow, Poland; [Acharya, U.

One of the most common problems encountered in the use of powered exoskeletons is the detection of the motion intentions of the user. Many approaches to conquering this problem have been developed using Electromyography (EMG) sensors, Electroencephalography (EEG) sensors, Center of Pressure (COP), and so forth. When a method, such as the surface EMG, is contaminated with noise during acquisition, it is important to process that raw EMG signal. Doing so usually takes time, and time delays in such a system can lead to a loss in synchronization between the wearer and the exoskeleton. Many algorithms have been developed for data acquisition and the filtering of raw EMG signals as well as accelerometer data. Our approach involves designing an almost sensor-less low limb exoskeleton that is powered by an electric Direct Current (DC) motor, and the same motor is used to detect motion via monitoring the voltage and the current variation. Experimental results are obtained for the actuating knee flexion-to-extension then extension-to-flexion of a sitting person using the National Instrument (NI) MyRIO as a data acquisition system with NI-LabView. The results support the hypothesis that the developed system can detect human motion and drive the motor in the necessary direction without the use of uncomfortable electrodes (sensors) and their connections. Additionally, the system supported the wearer to move his leg up (extension) without having too much effort to do so. In order to identify muscle activation with the change in the angle along the sagittal plane, an accelerometer has been attached to the system. The proposed approach could help open a new pathway along which researchers could develop low-cost and easy-to-wear powered exoskeletons which could emulate precisely the normal gait of a human.","[Al-Ayyad, Muhammad; Moh'd, Bashar Al-haj] Al Ahliyya Amman Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Med Engn, Amman 19328, Jordan; [Qasem, Nidal] Al Ahliyya Amman Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Amman 19328, Jordan; [Al-Takrori, Mohammad] Politecn Milano Univ, Sch Ind & Informat Engn, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Al-Ayyad, M (corresponding author), Al Ahliyya Amman Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Med Engn, Amman 19328, Jordan.",mayyad@ammanu.edu.jo; bashar105@ammanu.edu.jo; ne.qasem@ammanu.edu.jo; mohammad.al@mail.polimi.it,"Qasem, Nidal Eyad/AAW-4178-2020","Qasem, Nidal Eyad/0000-0003-3450-9406; Al-haj Moh'd, Bashar/0000-0002-0855-2729; Al Ayyad, muhammad/0000-0002-8188-0817",,,,24,1,1,4,42,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

This framework selects the most appropriate system amongst available MPMSs for the telemedicine environment. Prioritisation of MPMSs is a challenging task due to (a) multiple evaluation criteria, (b) importance of criteria, (c) data variation and (d) unmeasurable values. The secondary data presented as the decision evaluation matrix include six systems (namely, Yale-National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), advanced health and disaster aid network, personalised health monitoring, CMS, MobiHealth and NTU) as alternatives and 13 criteria (namely, supported number of sensors, sensor front-end (SFE) communication, SFE to mobile base unit (MBU) communications, display of biosignals on the MBU, storage of biosignals on the MBU, intra-body area network (BAN) communication problems, extra-BAN communication problems, extra-BAN communication technology, extra-BAN communication protocols, back-end system communication technology, intended geographic area of use, end-to-end security and reported trial problems) based on the architectural components of MPMSs. These criteria are adopted from the most relevant studies and are found to be applicable to this study. The prioritisation framework is developed in three stages. (1) The unmeasurable values of the MPMS evaluation criteria in the adopted decision evaluation matrix based on expert opinion are represented by using the best-worst method (BWM). (2) The importance of the evaluation criteria based on the architectural components of the MPMS is determined by using the BWM. (3) The VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method is utilised to rank the MPMSs according to the determined importance of the evaluation criteria and the adopted decision matrix. For validation, mean +/- standard deviation is used to verify the similarity of systematic prioritisations objectively. The following results are obtained. (1) The BWM represents the unmeasurable values of the MPMS evaluation criteria. (2) The BWM is suitable for weighing the evaluation criteria based on the architectural components of the MPMS. (3) VIKOR is suitable for solving the MPMS prioritisation problem. Moreover, the internal and external VIKOR group decision making are approximately the same, with the best MPMS being Yale-NASA' and the worst MPMS being NTU'. (4) For the objective validation, remarkable differences are observed between the group scores, which indicate the similarity of internal and external prioritisation results.","[Almahdi, E.

Multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) analysis techniques are proposed as effective solutions to solve these issues from a methodological aspect. This methodological aspect involves a framework for benchmarking MPMSs on the basis of MCDM to rank available MPMSs and select a suitable one. The benchmarking framework is discussed in four steps.

In this paper, we proposed a framework that will aid these departments in evaluating, benchmarking and ranking available multiclass classification models for the selection of the best one. Medical organisations have continuously faced evaluation and benchmarking challenges in such endeavour, especially when no single model is superior. Moreover, the improper selection of multiclass classification for acute leukaemia model may be costly for medical organisations. For example, when a patient dies, one such organisation will be legally or financially sued for incidents in which the model fails to fulfil its desired outcome. With regard to evaluation and benchmarking, multiclass classification models are challenging processes due to multiple evaluation and conflicting criteria. This study structured a decision matrix (DM) based on the crossover of 2 groups of multi-evaluation criteria and 22 multiclass classification models. The matrix was then evaluated with datasets comprising 72 samples of acute leukaemia, which include 5327 gens. Subsequently, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques are used in the benchmarking and ranking of multiclass classification models. The MCDM used techniques that include the integrated BWM and VIKOR. BWM has been applied for the weight calculations of evaluation criteria, whereas VIKOR has been used to benchmark and rank classification models. VIKOR has also been employed in two decision-making contexts: individual and group decision making and internal and external group aggregation. Results showed the following: (1) the integration of BWM and VIKOR is effective at solving the benchmarking/selection problems of multiclass classification models. (2) The ranks of classification models obtained from internal and external VIKOR group decision making were almost the same, and the best multiclass classification model based on the two was Bayes. Naive Byes Updateable' and the worst one was Trees.LMT'.

It is a mood disorder which can be detected using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The manual detection of depression by analyzing the EEG signals requires lot of experience, tedious and time consuming. Hence, a fully automated depression diagnosis system developed using EEG signals will help the clinicians. Therefore, we propose a deep hybrid model developed using convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) architectures to detect depression usingEEG signals. In the deep model, temporal properties of the signals are learned with CNN layers and the sequence learning process is provided through the LSTM layers. In this work, we have used EEG signals obtained from left and right hemispheres of the brain. Our work has provided 99.12% and 97.66% classification accuracies for the right and left hemisphere EEG signals respectively. Hence, we can conclude that the developed CNN-LSTM model is accurate and fast in detecting the depression using EEG signals. It can be employed in psychiatry wards of the hospitals to detect the depression using EEG signals accurately and thusaid the psychiatrists.","[Ay, Betul; Aydin, Galip] Firat Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Elazig, Turkey; [Yildirim, Ozal; Talo, Muhammed; Baloglu, Ulas Baran] Munzur Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Tunceli, Turkey; [Puthankattil, Subha D.] Natl Inst Technol Calicut, Dept Elect Engn, Calicut, Kerala, India; [Acharya, U.

A non-quantifiable local feature is adopted in this paper to design a robust texture descriptor so as to enhance the robustness of the texture classification in the rotation and scale changes, which can improve the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid nodules in ultrasound images. First of all, the concept of local feature with rotational symmetry is introduced. It is found that many rotation invariant local features are rotational symmetric to a certain degree. Therefore, we propose a novel local feature to describe the rotation invariant properties of the texture. In order to deal with the change of rotation and scale of ultrasound thyroid nodules in image, Pairwise rotation-invariant spatial context feature is adopted to analyze the texture feature, which can combine with the scale information without increasing the dimension of the local feature. The fadopted local features have strong robustness to rotation and gray intensity variation. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the existing algorithms on thyroid ultrasound data sets, which greatly improve the Diagnosis accuracy of thyroid nodules.","[Bi, Li; Shuang, Zhang] Jinzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Jinzhou 121001, Liaoning, Peoples R China","Bi, L (corresponding author), Jinzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Jinzhou 121001, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",13941647321@163.com,,,,,,29,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

DeepLNAnno has a unique three-tier working process and loads of features like semi-automatic annotation, which not only make it much easier for doctors to annotate compared to some other annotating systems but also increase the accuracy of the labels.

To achieve a quality service and minimize the negative impact that traffic on network can cause, it's very important to manage the devices that intervene in this service. Hence, the QoE evaluation allows obtaining benefits both customers and service providers. The main objective of this paper is to measure QoE of a teleconsultation application in Mental Health named Psiconnect, using an approach based on pentagram model. For the QoE evaluation of Psiconnect application we used the pentagram model based on the measurement of 5 factors (integrality, retainability, availability, usability, and instantaneousness). This model allows to design quantifiable metrics for quality evaluations. Using the model cited the value of QoE for Psiconnect is 1.793 (between 1.6 and 1.8). Comparing with Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) test, some users are dissatisfied with the use of the application although the result is near 1.8, so the most of users are satisfied with the use of teleconsultation service based in Skype in the Psiconnect app. There are different models to measure QoE having into account subjective parameters. This is important an estimation of QoE in a quantitative form.

Because of this, we have designed an educational program based on motor games, active videogames and virtual learning environments to improve the long-term health of children. This article presents and analyzes the results of a study on the nutritional knowledge and adherence to the Mediterranean diet of 46 obese children aged 6 to 12 years in the Canary Islands who participated in an educational program.

Multiple time series clinical liver cancer dataset is collected from different dataset and time interval. A merging algorithm is used to merge all attributes collected from different sources in multiple time periods. In order to preserve the originality of information, statistical measures of each attribute is calculated and considered them as additional attributes for accurate prediction. However the merged dataset is unbalanced, in which, the number of samples from HCC recurrence class is much smaller than from HCC non recurrence. The feature weighting scheme select optimal features and parameter of classifiers are sequentially obtained from multiple iterations which causes higher computation time. In this paper, an efficient sampling approach is proposed using Inverse Random under Sampling (IRUS) to overcome class imbalance issue. IRUS under sample the majority class which creates a number of distinct partitions with a boundary separated minority and majority class samples. Additionally an optimization approach is proposed using Artificial Plant Optimization (APO) algorithm to select optimal features and parameters of classifiers to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of classification. The optimization approach reduces the number of iteration and computation time for feature selection and parameter selection for classifiers which classify the recurrence and non recurrence of HCC.

Modern pulse oximeters exploit different body sites (eg fingertip, forehead or earlobe). All those are bulky and uncomfortable, resulting in low patient compliance. Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy and precision of a wrist-sensor pulse oximeter (Oxitone-1000, Oxitone Medical) vs. the traditional fingertip device. Fifteen healthy volunteers and 23 patients were recruited. The patient group included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (N=8), asthma (N=6), sarcoidosis (N=5) and others. Basic demographic data, skin tone type, smoking status and medical history were recorded. Blood oxygen level (SpO2) and pulse-rate values were determined by a non-invasive pulse oximeter (Reference, a conventional FDA-cleared fingertip pulse oximeter) and by Oxitone-1000. All tests were performed in singleton and in a blinded fashion. The measurements were done in sitting and standing positions, as well as after a 6-min walk test. The mean age was 60.4 +/- 9.83years, 55% were male. No significant differences were observed between the wrist-sensor and the traditional fingertip pulse oximeters in all tested parameters. Mean SpO2 was 96.45% vs. 97.18% and the mean pulse was 74.64 vs. 74.6bpm (Oxitone-1000 vs. Reference, respectively, p<0.0001). Precision rate was 2.28472% and the accuracy was met (Arms -Root mean-square-error<3%). The Oxitone-1000 is both accurate and precise for SpO2 and pulse measurements during daily activities of pulmonary patients, and is not inferior to standard devices for spot checking or short period examinations. Its wrist-sensor design is comfortable and provides the advantage of extended use.","[Guber, Alexander; Shochet, Gali Epstein; Shitrit, David] Meir Med Ctr, Pulm Dept, Tshernichovsky 59, IL-442801 Kefar Sava, Israel; [Guber, Alexander; Shitrit, David] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Kohn, Sarah] Oxitone Med, IL-4464312 Kefar Sava, Israel","Shitrit, D (corresponding author), Meir Med Ctr, Pulm Dept, Tshernichovsky 59, IL-442801 Kefar Sava, Israel.;Shitrit, D (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, Tel Aviv, Israel.",Alexgu@clalit.org.il; gali.epstein@clalit.org.il; sarah.kohn@Oxitone.com; davids3@clalit.org.il,"Shochet, Gali Epstein/AAC-7550-2020","Shochet, Gali Epstein/0000-0002-3417-9171; Shitrit, David/0000-0002-2331-5270",Oxitone Medical,Partial funding was received for this research from Oxitone Medical.,,19,6,6,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

However, low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are not receiving the same advantages of technology, which may be due to inadequate technological infrastructure and financial resources, lack of interest among policy makers and healthcare service providers, lack of skills and capacity among healthcare professionals in using technology based interventions, and resistance of the public to the use of technologies for healthcare or health promotion activities. Technology-based interventions offer considerable promise to develop entirely new models of healthcare both within and outside of formal systems of care and offer the opportunity to have a large public health impact. Such technology-based interventions could be used to address targeted global health problems in LMICs, including the chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) - a growing health system burden in LMICs. Major preventable behavioral risk factors of chronic NCDs are increasing in LMICs, and innovative interventions are essential to address these risk factors. Computer-based or mobile-based virtual coaches or Relational Agents (RAs) are increasingly being explored for counseling patients to change their health behavior in high-income countries; however, the use of RAs in LMICs has not been studied. In this paper, we summarize the growing application of RA technology in behavior change interventions in high-income countries and describe the potential of its use in LMICs. Finally, we review the potential barriers and challenges in promoting RAs in LMICs.","[Kabir, Md Faisal] North Dakota State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Fargo, ND 58108 USA; [Schulman, Daniel] Philips Res North Amer, 2 Canal Pk,3rd Floor, Cambridge, MA 02141 USA; [Abdullah, Abu S.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Boston Med Ctr, 801 Massachusetts Ave, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Abdullah, Abu S.] Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Abdullah, Abu S.] Duke Kunshan Univ, Global Hlth Program, Kunshan 215347, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Abdullah, A (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Sch Med, Boston Med Ctr, 801 Massachusetts Ave, Boston, MA 02118 USA.;Abdullah, A (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC 27710 USA.;Abdullah, A (corresponding author), Duke Kunshan Univ, Global Hlth Program, Kunshan 215347, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",abu.s.abdullah@gmail.com,"Kabir, Faisal/O-6702-2019","Kabir, Faisal/0000-0001-6088-9487; Abdullah, Abu/0000-0002-9841-0344",US National Institutes of Health (NIH) Fogarty International Centre [R25TW009715]; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTER [R25TW009715] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This study was supported by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) Fogarty International Centre [grant numbers R25TW009715; PI: Abu Abdullah].

The vision loss is avoided if the detection of HE in the beginning times. Therefore, a novel method is proposed to detect hard exudates automatically. Previously, for exudate prediction supervised and unsupervised methods have been used. Fault detection of hard exudates, miss classification rate will affect these models because of the characteristics like, similarities with other components in the retinal image and intra variations. For that, the retinal fundus images has been used as input. Then these images are pre-processed with some pre-processing algorithms like image enhancement, equalization of histogram to improve the proposed system performance. Total image data files are divided to training and testing datasets. Features are extracted for training and testing using feature extraction algorithm individually. Then classifier algorithm predicts whether the hard exudate is proliferative or non-proliferative.

Japan's nationwide survey of hospitals was utilized to extract the EHR adoption rates among Japanese hospitals. Comparable datasets from the Healthcare Information and Management System Society (HIMSS) and the American Hospital Association (AHA) were utilized to extract EHR adoption rates among U.S. hospitals. The trends of EHR adoption were stratified and analyzed by hospital size and hospital ownership status. As of 2014, the U.S. hospitals had a wider adoption of basic with clinical notes' EHRs compared to Japan (45.6% vs. 27.3%), but large hospitals (400+ beds) in Japan have shown a similar adoption rate of EHR systems than those of U.S. (65.6% vs. 68.5%). Governmental hospitals tend to be more advanced in EHR adoption than non-profit hospitals in Japan (53.0% vs. 21.5%). Non-profit hospitals show the highest adoption rate of basic' EHR systems in the U.S. as of 2014 (63.3%). Using the certified' definition of EHRs, the EHR adoption rate was close to 96% among U.S. hospitals as of 2016; however, updated EHR adoption data from Japanese hospitals has yet to be collected and published. U.S. and Japan have considerably increased EHR adoption among hospitals; however, this analysis indicates different trends of EHR adoption among hospitals by size and ownership status in both countries. Learnings from government programs supporting EHR adoption in the U.S. and Japan can be helpful in planning useful strategies for future hospital-oriented health IT policies in other developed nations.","[Kanakubo, Takako; Kharrazi, Hadi] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, 615 N Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Kharrazi, Hadi] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Ctr Populat Hlth IT, 624 N Broadway, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA","Kharrazi, H (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, 615 N Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.;Kharrazi, H (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Ctr Populat Hlth IT, 624 N Broadway, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",tkanaku1@jhu.edu; kharrazi@jhu.edu,"Kharrazi, Hadi/Q-1725-2015","Kharrazi, Hadi/0000-0003-1481-4323",,,,60,8,8,5,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The feature selection is probably found to be the best factor to be optimized and is an on-going challenge in the midst of the optimization problems in the human recognition system. The feature selection aspires to bring down the number of the features, remove all types of redundant data and noise which result in a very high rate of recognition. The step further effects on the human recognition system and its performance. The work further presents a newer biometric system of verification that was multimodal and based on three different features which are the face, the hand vein, and the ear. This has today emerged as an extensively researched topic which spans various disciplines like signal processing, pattern recognition, and also computer vision. The features have been extracted by making use of the Incremental Principal Component Analysis (IPCA). Further, the work presented another novel algorithm of feature selection which was based on the Multi-Objective Modified Genetic Algorithm (MOM-GA). The Genetic Algorithm (GA) had been modified by means of introducing a levy search as opposed to a process of mutation. The algorithm has also proved to be an effective method of computation in which the search space is found to be highly dimensional. A classifier that makes use of the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) for classifying all accurate features is used. There were some investigations that were carried out and these results proved that this MOM-GA feature selection algorithm had been found as that which can generate certain excellent results using a minimal set of chosen features.","[Karthiga, R.] United Inst Technol, Dept ECE, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Mangai, S.] Velalar Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Erode, Tamil Nadu, India","Karthiga, R (corresponding author), United Inst Technol, Dept ECE, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.",karthiga211186@gmail.com; prof.mangai@gmail.com,"S, Mangai/AAT-4309-2020","S, Mangai/0000-0002-4447-9063",,,,32,5,5,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of some of the major human psychological disorders (stress, depression, autism, anxiety, Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer, Parkinson, insomnia, schizophrenia and mood disorder) mined using different supervised and nature-inspired computing techniques. A systematic review methodology based on three-dimensional search space i.e. disease diagnosis, psychological disorders and classification techniques has been employed. This study reviews the discipline, models, and methodologies used to diagnose different psychological disorders. Initially, different types of human psychological disorders along with their biological and behavioural symptoms have been presented. The racial effects on these human disorders have been briefly explored. The morbidity rate of psychological disordered Indian patients has also been depicted. The significance of using different supervised learning and nature-inspired computing techniques in the diagnosis of different psychological disorders has been extensively examined and the publication trend of the related articles has also been comprehensively accessed. The brief details of the datasets used in mining these human disorders have also been shown. In addition, the effect of using feature selection on the predictive rate of accuracy of these human disorders is also presented in this study. Finally, the research gaps have been identified that witnessed that there is a full scope for diagnosis of mania, insomnia, mood disorder using emerging nature-inspired computing techniques. Moreover, there is a need to explore the use of a binary or chaotic variant of different nature-inspired computing techniques in the diagnosis of different human psychological disorders.

Accurate prediction of lung cancer is an essential step for making effective clinical decisions. After identifying the lung cancer, minimum scopes are available in the medications for patient living in the world. Hemoglobin level and TNM stage wise patients survival period has to be varied. Some group of people survival period is minimal and another group of people survival time is lengthy. This study is aimed to develop a prediction model with new clinical variables to predict lung cancer patients. It's based on revised 8th edition study of TNM in lung cancer. These new attributes are collected from SEER databases, Indian cancer hospitals and research centers. The collected new attributes are classified using supervised machine learning algorithms of linear regression, Naive Bayes classifier and proposed algorithms of Gaussian K-Base NB classifier. In particular, for TNM stage 1 group of people with normal hemoglobin level (NHBL), that group of lung cancer patient quality of life is highly enhanced. Which proved by using supervised machine learning algorithms. The proposed algorithm classified the database in terms of with respect to tumor size and HB level and the results are confirmed in the R environment. The continuous attribute classification method to prove first level of TNM in lung cancer patient along with standard hemoglobin has to be maintained that the people survivability rate is higher than the smaller level of hemoglobin people survival rate.

One of the important factors in the successful implementation of a PACS system is identifying and prioritizing the challenges from the perspectives of involved staff and user of this system. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine and compare the challenges of implementing PACS from perspectives these users in educational hospitals. This study was conducted on all IT and medical equipment staff, and radiology residents (n=140) in Kerman University of Medical Sciences (KUMS) and Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (SUMS) in 2016. The data were collected through two researcher-made questionnaires. Their validity was approved by radiologists, IT staff, and medical informatics specialists and their reliability through calculation of Cronbach's Alpha (0.969 and 0.795). We used Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) to compare the scores given by three groups of participants in the challenges and Univariate Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to compare the scores in two universities. The participants believed that technical challenges were more important than other challenges (x=3.74, SD=0.7). IT experts (x=3.87, SD=1) and radiology residents (x=3.95, SD=0.9) gave the higher scores to the shortage of high quality monitors factor and medical equipment experts (x=4.26, SD=0.87) to the low speed of communication networks factor among all technical challenges. The mean scores given to technical (x=76.1, SD=13.5) and managerial (x=16, SD=5.9) challenges in SUMS were more than the scores of the same challenges in KUMS (x=69.9, SD=15.7) and (x=11.9, SD=6.4) (p<0.05). The technical challenges are the most common challenges to PACS implementation, and different universities experience different levels of technical challenges. Eliminating implementation challenges can reduce the risk of failure in the utilization process. Based on the results of this study, providing necessary infrastructures such as appropriate monitors and upgraded IT equipment can prevent many of the PACS implementation challenges.","[Khajouei, Reza] Kerman Univ Med Sci, Inst Future Studies Hlth, Med Informat Res Ctr, Kerman, Iran; [Khajouei, Reza] Kerman Univ Med Sci, Fac Management & Med Informat Sci, Dept Hlth Informat Sci, Kerman, Iran; [Jahromi, Maryam Eslami] Kerman Univ Med Sci, Inst Futures Studies Hlth, Hlth Serv Management Res Ctr, Kerman 7616911320, Iran; [Ameri, Arefeh] Kerman Univ Med Sci, Fac Management & Med Informat Sci, Dept Hlth Informat Sci, Kerman, Iran; [Ameri, Arefeh] Kerman Univ Med Sci, Inst Future Studies Hlth, Med Informat Res Ctr, Kerman, Iran","Jahromi, ME (corresponding author), Kerman Univ Med Sci, Inst Futures Studies Hlth, Hlth Serv Management Res Ctr, Kerman 7616911320, Iran.",r.khajouei@yahoo.com; maryam.e246@gmail.com; ameri1373@gmail.com,"Khajouei, Reza/M-9994-2016","Khajouei, Reza/0000-0001-6094-5127; Ameri, Arefeh/0000-0003-1683-4424","Medical Informatics Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences [96.10.60.301]","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study resulted from research project No. 96.10.60.301 funded by the Medical Informatics Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences.",,59,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In this work, we aim to demonstrate that (1) even a complex ML model built on a national cohort can be transferred to two local healthcare systems, (2) while a model constructed on a local healthcare system's cohort is difficult to transfer; (3) we examine the impact of training cohort size on the transferability; and (4) we discuss criteria for external validity. We built a model using our previously published Multi-Task Learning-based methodology on a national cohort extracted from OptumLabs (R) Data Warehouse and transferred the model to two local healthcare systems (i.e., University of Minnesota Medical Center and Mayo Clinic) for external evaluation. The model remained valid when applied to the local patient populations and performed as well as locally constructed models (concordance: .73-.92), demonstrating transferability. The performance of the locally constructed models reduced substantially when applied to each other's healthcare system (concordance: .62-.90). We believe that our modeling approach, in which a model is learned from a national cohort and is externally validated, produces a transferable model, allowing patients at smaller healthcare systems to benefit from precision medicine.","[Kim, Era; Pieczkiewicz, David S.; Simon, Gyorgy J.] Univ Minnesota, Inst Hlth Informat, 8-100 Phillips Wangensteen Bldg, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Caraballo, Pedro J.] Mayo Clin, Dept Med, Div Gen Internal Med, Rochester, MN USA; [Caraballo, Pedro J.] Mayo Clin, Ctr Translat Informat & Knowledge Management, Rochester, MN USA; [Castro, M.

Efficient quality of care and safety often require calling patient at day one after outpatient surgery to check patient's recovery and search for complications. This increasing flow in same day surgery centres motivates the use of automatic systems to contact patients. The overall objective of this study was to evaluate automated software sending text messages (TM) to patients at day 1 after ambulatory surgery compared to classical phone calls. This prospective study took place in Rennes Teaching Hospital, France, from June 1st, 2015 to December 15th, 2016. All patients owning a mobile phone were included, adults and children by means of their parents. The primary end point was the rate of successfully contacted patients, compared to usual phone calls in 2014. In cases of no response or an abnormal response, an automatic alert was sent to the ambulatory unit. Within the 7246 patients included, response rate to TM was significantly higher than response to phone calls in 2014 (87% vs 57%, respectively p<0.0001). Most patients (85%) responded in less than 60min. The TM algorithm detected 36% alerts (12% for lack of response to TM and 24% for TM's content). The total of reached patients' rate with TM and then phone call after an alert was 90%.

Frequent scanning of fetal leads to clinical disturbances to the fetal growth and the quantitative interpretation of Ultrasonic images also a difficult task compared to other image modalities. In the present work a three-stage hybrid algorithm has been developed to segment the US fetal kidney images for the detection of shape and contour. At the first stage the hybrid Mean Median (Hybrid MM) filter is applied to reduce the speckle noise. Then a kernel based Fuzzy C - means clustering is used to detect the shape and contour. Finally, the texture features are obtained from the segmented images. Based on the obtained texture features, the abnormalities are detected.

The interference of mammographic image is removed at the pre-processing stages. A multi-scale features are extracted by a feature generation model. The performance did not improve by all extracted feature, therefore feature selection is performed by nature-inspired optimization algorithm. At last, the hybridized ELM classifier taken the selected optimal features to classify malignant from benign micro calcifications. The proposed work is compared with various classifiers and it shown better performance in training time, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The existing approaches considered here are SVM (Support Vector Machine) and NB (Naive Bayes classifier).

Remote health monitoring systems (RHMS) in telemedicine refers to resources, strategies, methods and installations that enable doctors or other medical professionals to work remotely to consult, diagnose and treat patients. The goal of RHMS is to provide timely medical services at remote areas through telecommunication technologies. Through major advancements in technology, particularly in wireless networking, cloud computing and data storage, RHMS is becoming a feasible aspect of modern medicine. RHMS for the prioritisation of patients with multiple chronic diseases (MCDs) plays an important role in sustainably providing high-quality healthcare services. Further investigations are required to highlight the limitations of the prioritisation of patients with MCDs over a telemedicine environment. This study introduces a comprehensive and inclusive review on the prioritisation of patients with MCDs in telemedicine applications. Furthermore, it presents the challenges and open issues regarding patient prioritisation in telemedicine. The findings of this study are as follows: (1) The limitations and problems of existing patients' prioritisation with MCDs are presented and emphasised. (2) Based on the analysis of the academic literature, an accurate solution for remote prioritisation in a large scale of patients with MCDs was not presented.

The Gini index isa statistic used in economics to assess difference in the distribution of wealth among groups. We reported a high degree of inequality among hospitals. In this paper, we extend this work by calculating the intragenerational mobility for the hospitals present in 2007-2008 and 2015-2016. Whereas in economics intragenerational mobility often is measured as changes in income over time within a group, we study changes in hospitals' surgical caseloads. Intragenerational mobility was quantified using the Spearman rank correlation, the slope of the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression line in the log scale, and the Shorrocks trace index. The results were consistent across the three measures. There was a low degree of mobility for the surgical caseloads of the hospitals during the 10-year period under study. For example, based on the slope of the OLS regression, intragenerational mobility was not significantly different from zero (P>0.05). None (0%) of the 113 hospitals with at least 10 cases both periods increased from the 1st to 5th quintile, 1st to 4th quintile, 2nd to 5th quintile, 2nd to 4th quintile, or even from 3rd to 5th quintile.

It can be applied in numerous application areas such as medical, remote sensing, computer vision etc. Brain tumor is caused due to formation of abnormal tissues within human brain. Therefore, it is necessary to remove affected tumor part from the brain securely. Among various medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) employs a vital role to generate images of internal parts of human body. Image segmentation is one of the challenging tasks in today's medical field. An effective segmentation using MRI slices can help to identifying the tumor with its actual size and shape. To meet this requirement, a novel method called Adaptive Convex Region Contour (ACRC) algorithm is presented. Here, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is utilized for slice classification whether it is normal or abnormal. After obtaining SVM results, abnormal slices are involved in segmentation process. Since, human body is having complicated 3D anatomical structure naturally. Unfortunately, MRI slices are yields only 2Dimensional images. The actual shape of tumor cannot be clearly visualized in 2D form. Hence, transformation from 2D to 3D is essential which helps the doctors during surgery. The Rapid Mode Image Matching (RMIM) algorithm has to be followed for 3D reconstruction modeling. After building 3D model, the original volume of the tumor is estimated. The precise experimentation was implemented in MATLAB simulation environment. The obtained results are confirmed that proposed method has better accurate results compared to existing methods.","[Pandiselvi, T.] Kamaraj Coll Engn & Technol, Dept ECE, Virudunagar, Tamil Nadu, India; [Maheswaran, R.] Mepco Schlenk Engn Coll, Dept Mech Engn, Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu, India","Pandiselvi, T (corresponding author), Kamaraj Coll Engn & Technol, Dept ECE, Virudunagar, Tamil Nadu, India.",pandskt@gmail.com; rmaheshin@yahoo.com,"Maheswaran, Rathinam/AAO-5645-2020","Maheswaran, Rathinam/0000-0001-5594-703X",,,,23,8,8,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Many researchers studied and investigated about detecting the exudates region but not satisfied with their results. Fundamental medical image processing steps with different techniques are implemented by the proposed system. Random Forest is a novel classification which is applied on color retinal images able to classify cluster of data with high accuracy. The performance of the proposed system is obtained by analyzing the accuracy obtained from the Random Forest classifier.

The majority of the intelligent schemes proposed for detecting the breast cancer relies on the human skill that helps in trustworthy determination of essential pattern that confirms the existence of the infected cancer cells for deciding upon the course of treatment. Further, most of the research works contributed in the literature for detecting breast cancer necessitates huge time and laborinvolved that increases the time of diagnosis. This Intelligent Artificial Bee Colony and Enhanced Monarchy Butterfly Optimization Technique (IABC-EMBOT) is proposed for effective breast cancer diagnosis. The core idea behind the formulation of IABC-EMBOT relies on two significant ameliorations that, i) focuses on the modification of Monarchy Butterfly Optimization that enhances the exploration degree based on the rate of exploitation of the searching space and ii) concentrates on the elimination in the limitations of the ABC scheme by enhancing the possibility of search diversification process through phenomenal update facilitated through the dynamic and adaptive butterfly operator that improves the search globally.

The availability and cost of the dermoscopic imaging system is still an issue. To mitigate this issue, this paper presented an integrated segmentation and Third Dimensional (3D) feature extraction approach for the accurate diagnosis of melanoma. A multi-atlas method is applied for the image segmentation. The patch-based label fusion model is expressed in a Bayesian framework to improve the segmentation accuracy. A depth map is obtained from the Two-dimensional (2D) dermoscopic image for reconstructing the 3D skin lesion represented as structure tensors. The 3D shape features including the relative depth features are obtained. Streaks are the significant morphological terms of the melanoma in the radial growth phase.

This study aimed to assess the agreement between the Apple Watch photoplethysmography sensor and a criterion, for measuring heart rate across a range of intensities during exercise and to determine the influence of skin type on the accuracy of the measure. Forty-five males (20-43 y) completed the Fitzpatrick Skin Scale and were classified into three different skin type groups: a) types II (n=15), III (n=15) and IV (n=15). Participants performed a graded incremental cycle-ergometer test while simultaneously wearing the Apple Watch and a Polar monitor as a criterion measure. Data from both devices were collected in 5-s epochs. Correlations between devices were very good (0.96-0.99 [95%CI: 0.94 to 0.99]). Significant differences were observed between skin types II and III when the intensity of the exercise was increased, albeit with trivial to small effect sizes (ES: 0.05 to 0.28). All significant differences corresponded to <2% of relative difference between both devices. Bland-Altman analyses showed a trivial but systematic underestimation of HR in the Apple Watch compared to Polar for all skin types during exercise. In conclusion, the Apple Watch accurately measures HR when cycling at different intensities and certain types of skin seem not to influence these measures, which may have important implications for controlling the intensity of exercise.","[Sanudo, Borja; De Hoyo, Moises] Univ Seville, Dept Phys Educ & Sport, Pirotecnia S-N, E-41012 Seville, Spain; [Munoz-Lopez, Alejandro] Univ Seville, Human Motric & Performance Area, Seville, Spain; [Perry, John] Mary Immaculate Coll, Dept Psychol, Limerick, Ireland; [Abt, Grant] Univ Hull, Dept Sport Hlth & Exercise Sci, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England","Sanudo, B (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Dept Phys Educ & Sport, Pirotecnia S-N, E-41012 Seville, Spain.",bsancor@us.es,"Sañudo, Borja/E-6280-2010; Perry, John/J-9546-2019; López, Alejandro Muñoz/S-6986-2019; Hoyo Lora, Moises de/Q-9649-2017","Sañudo, Borja/0000-0002-9969-9573; Perry, John/0000-0002-7284-9252; López, Alejandro Muñoz/0000-0003-1206-8697; Hoyo Lora, Moises de/0000-0003-1855-4012; Abt, Grant/0000-0002-4079-9270",,,,23,9,9,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Therefore, a precise melanoma segmentation technique is introduced based on the Gradient and Feature Adaptive Contour (GFAC) model to detect melanoma skin cancer in earliest stage and diagnosis of dermoscopic images. In the proposed image segmentation technique pre-processing and noise elimination techniques are introduced to decrease noise and make execution faster. This technique helps in separating the required entity from the background and gather the information from the adjacent pixels of similar classes. Multiple Gaussian distributed patterns are adopted to extract efficient features and to get precise segmentation. The proposed GFACmodel is noise free and consist of smoother border. The segmentation model efficiency is tested on PH2 dataset.

Segmentation and subsequent quantitative analysis of brain tumor MRI are routine and crucial for treatment. Due to the time-consuming and tedious manual segmentation, automatic segmentation methods are required for accurate and timely treatment. Recently, segmentation methods based on deep learning are popular because of their self-learning and generalization ability. Therefore, we propose a novel automatic 3D CNN-based method for brain tumor segmentation. In order to better capture the contextual information, we design the network architecture based on u-net and replace the simple skip connection with encoder adaptation blocks. To further improve the performance and reduce computational burden at the same time, we also use dense connected fusion blocks in decoder. We train our model with generalised dice loss function to alleviate the problem of class imbalance. The proposed model is evaluated on the BRATS 2015 testing dataset and obtains dice scores of 0.84, 0.72 and 0.62 for whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively. Our model is accurate and efficient, achieving results that comparable to the reported state-of-the-art results.","[Sun, Jiawei; Chen, Wei; Peng, Suting; Liu, Boqiang] Shandong Univ, Sch Control Sci & Engn, Jinan 250061, Shandong, Peoples R China","Liu, BQ (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Sch Control Sci & Engn, Jinan 250061, Shandong, Peoples R China.",bqliu@sdu.edu.cn,"Chen, Wei/AAF-8989-2020","Chen, Wei/0000-0002-1281-3389; Sun, Jiawei/0000-0003-1474-8573",Department of Science and Technology of Shandong Province [2017CXGC1502],This work was supported by the Department of Science and Technology of Shandong Province (Grant No.2017CXGC1502).,,38,16,16,3,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

An activation function is proposed by the DL-RNN and also the parameter rectified functions for analyzing the sequence of data in the hyper-spectral images. Throughout the training procedure, the higher learning rates are fairly used by the activation function which has been proposed by avoiding the risk of divergence.

For the coarse registration, a supervised regression convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is used to optimize the spatial variation by minimizing the loss when combine the CT images with the CBCT images. For the fine registration, intensity-based image registration is used to calculate the accurate spatial difference of the input image pairs.

VR is constructed to have many potentials uses in radiology education. Visualization of 3D anatomic structures in a virtual environment give another tool for teaching to students and patients about anatomy of the body. Four anatomy modules described here demonstrate example user interaction patterns best suited for viewing contexts.

Recent advancements in mobile health has made mobile apps a feasible method of delivering population-based, self-management interventions to address SCI-specific secondary complications. The objective of this study is to describe stakeholder perspectives on the development of a functional mobile app to facilitate self-management skills needed to prevent secondary complications following recent SCI during inpatient rehabilitation. A user-centered design approach was used that involved an evolving mobile app and the collection of prospective qualitative data. Stakeholders from three groups were enrolled in the study: individuals admitted for rehabilitation following SCI (n=20) and informal (n=7) and formal (n=48) caregivers. Iterative feedback was gathered from rehabilitation inpatients during ongoing interactions and via post-discharge exit questionnaires, from informal caregivers via one-on-one interviews, and from formal caregivers via series of focus groups at various phases throughout the design process. Three main themes emerged from the analysis: (1) being individualized and user friendly (i.e., developing an app that is simple and easy to use to facilitate universal uptake), (2) targeting goals to promote self-management (i.e., adopting self-management skills relative to personal goals and confidence), and (3) increasing participation and support-seeking to facilitate lifestyle change (i.e., encouraging leisure activities to facilitate community integration).

Current economic constraints, such as limited Medicaid and Medicare insurance payments, limit our patients' ability to receive urgent surgical interventions as well as access preventative diagnostic tools. Rather than downsizing the workforce, future sustainability must be derived upon effective cost structures supported by improved quality control measures and increased patient accessibility. Surgeries were performed during 29% of hospitalizations and comprised 48% of the $387 billion in healthcare expenditures in 2011. Further, surgical procedures managed to account for 40-70% of hospital revenues. Effective cost reduction begins at the source and in the case of hospital systems, the operating room (OR). Taking this into consideration, administrators evaluating future revenue streams should look to consider OR-based cost reduction measures as part of their first step approach. Improving OR efficiency through block time and staff optimization remain the premise of today's existing literature on OR management strategies.","[Boggs, Steven D.] Univ Tennessee, Med Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol, Memphis, TN USA; [Tan, Derek W.; Watkins, Caleb L.] Univ Vermont, Larner Coll Med, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Tsai, Mitchell H.] Univ Vermont, Larner Coll Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Burlington, VT USA; [Tsai, Mitchell H.] Univ Vermont, Larner Coll Med, Dept Orthopaed & Rehabil, Burlington, VT USA; [Tsai, Mitchell H.] Univ Vermont, Dept Surg, Larner Coll Med, Burlington, VT 05405 USA","Tan, DW (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Larner Coll Med, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",derek.tan@med.uvm.edu,"Boggs, Steven/AAS-7578-2021","Tan, Derek/0000-0002-0590-870X; Boggs, Steven/0000-0003-2713-7616",,,,64,4,4,2,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Thus, diagnosing glaucoma in the early stage is essential for treatment. In this paper, an automatic method for early glaucoma screening is proposed. The proposed method combines structural parameters and textural features extracted from enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) images and fundus images. The method first segments anterior the lamina cribrosa surface (ALCS) based on region-aware strategy and residual U-Net and then extracts structural features of the lamina cribrosa, such as lamina cribrosa depth and deformation of lamina cribrosa. In fundus images, scanning lines based on disc center and brightness reduction are used for optic disc segmentation and brightness compensation is utilized for segmenting the optic cup. Afterward, the cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) and textural features are extracted from fundus images. Hybrid features are used for training and classification to screen glaucoma by gcForest in the early stage. The proposed method has given exceptional results with 96.88% accuracy and 91.67% sensitivity.","[Chen, Zailiang; Zheng, Xianxian; Shen, Hailan; Zeng, Ziyang; Liu, Qing] Cent South Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhuo] Cent South Univ, Xiangya Hosp 2, Changsha 410011, Hunan, Peoples R China","Shen, HL (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China.",hn_shl@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [61672542],This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61672542.,,38,2,2,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

This requires a long-lasting power supply to make implantable devices cost-effective and efficient. Since the current trend is to implant catheter-free stand-alone electrodes (implantable cardiac monitors), the need for smaller devices is at odds with the need for long-life batteries. To avoid these problems, we propose a passive endocardial sensor able to monitor the movement of the considered chamber based on a permanent magnet shaped for implantation in the internal chamber of the heart (i.e. the right atrium) and an external gauss meter unit to measure sensor-induced magnetic field variations. Since the magnet is permanent, no replacement is needed after the first implant, thereby reducing the risks linked to invasive procedures, and the battery in the external device can be substituted more easily. To test our idea we used a permanent magnet mounted on the tip of a commercial catheter for heart mapping together with a dedicated gauss meter built in our laboratory. The device was tested in vitro and the magnetic field variations were acquired and measured in different conditions of movement and distances. The results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and open an interesting new scenario where permanent magnets can be used to monitor the mechanical behaviour of the heart.","[Corazza, Ivan; Diemberger, Igor; Martignani, Christian; Ziacchi, Matteo; Zannoli, Romano; Biffi, Mauro] Univ Bologna, Expt Diagnost & Specialty Med Dept, Bologna, Italy; [Rossi, Pier Luca; Lombi, Alessandro] Univ Bologna, Dept Phys & Astron, Bologna, Italy; [Rossi, Pier Luca; Lombi, Alessandro] INFN Bologna, Bologna, Italy","Corazza, I (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Expt Diagnost & Specialty Med Dept, Bologna, Italy.",ivan.corazza@unibo.it,"Corazza, Ivan/AAY-8566-2021; Ziacchi, Matteo/AAC-3608-2022; Martignani, Cristian/AAA-4617-2020","Corazza, Ivan/0000-0003-2078-1978; ",,,,24,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

According to deep learning model, a novel brain tumor segmentation method is developed by integrating fully convolutional neural networks (FCNN) and dense micro-block difference feature (DMDF) into a unified framework so as to obtain segmentation results with appearance and spatial consistency. Firstly, we propose a local feature to describe the rotation invariant property of the texture. In order to deal with the change of rotation and scale in texture image, Fisher vector encoding method is used to analyze the texture feature, which can combine with the scale information without increasing the dimension of the local feature. The obtained local features have strong robustness to rotation and gray intensity variation. Then, the non-quantifiable local feature is fused to the FCNN to perform fine boundary segmentation. Since brain tumors occupy a small portion of the image, deconvolutional layers are designed with skip connections to obtain a high quality feature map. Compared with the traditional MRI brain tumor segmentation methods, the experimental results show that the segmentation accuracy and stability has been greatly improved. Average Dice index can be up to 90.98%.

During this, the common spatial pattern (CSP) was used to project data subject to the ratio of projected energy of one class to that of the other class was maximized. The optimal projection dimension was determined corresponding to the maximum of area under the curve (AUC) for each participant. Eventually, regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) is possible to decode the imagined motor sensed using electroencephalogram (EEG).

The threshold segmentation method is used to carry out the rat myocardial glue under different exercise loads. The segmentation of the regional pixel feature block of the three-dimensional morphological features of the original fiber is segmented into a block vector with high resolution, and the regional reconstruction of the three-dimensional morphological features of the rat myocardial collagen fibers under different motion loads is carried out to realize the high resolution identification and classification of the 3D morphological features of the rat myocardial collagen fibers. The simulation results show that the three-dimensional simulation of the morphological changes of rat myocardial collagen fibers under different exercise loads is better, and the accuracy of feature extraction is higher.","[Jian, Liu] Ludong Univ, Yantai 264025, Shandong, Peoples R China","Jian, L (corresponding author), Ludong Univ, Yantai 264025, Shandong, Peoples R China.",se3813@163.com,,,,,,14,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The predominant anomaly due to the blood flow dynamics leads to the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias in the cardiac system. In this work, estimation of cardiac output (CO) parameter using blood flow rate analysis is carried out, which is a vital parameter to identify the subjects with left- ventricular arrhythmias (LVA). In particular, LVA is a resultant component of characteristic changes in blood rheology (blood flow rate). The CO is an intrinsic parameter derived from the stroke volume (SV) characterized by end-diastolic/systolic volumes (EDV/ESV) and heart rate. The pumping of blood from left ventricle (LV) reconciles in to R-R intervals depicted on ECG, which are used for heart rate estimation. The deviation from the nominal values of CO implies that, the subject is more prone to LVA. Further, the identification of subjects with LVA is accomplished by computing the features from the ECG signals. The proposed Feature Ranking Score (FRS) algorithm employs different statistical parameters to label the score of the extracted features. The feature score enables the selection optimal features for classification. The optimal features are further given to the Least Square- Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier for training and testing phases. The signals are acquired from public domain MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, used for validating the proposed technique for identifying the LVA using blood flow.","[Karnan, Hemalatha; Sivakumaran, N.] Natl Inst Technol, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India; [Manivel, Rajajeyakumar] SRM Med Coll Hosp & Res Ctr, Dept Physiol Trichy, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India","Karnan, H (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India.",hema.ae2012@gmail.com; nsk@nitt.edu; rajakumar60@gmail.com,"Manivel, Dr. Rajajeyakumar/J-4217-2016","Manivel, Dr. Rajajeyakumar/0000-0002-0772-7259",,,,27,4,4,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The aim of the study is to perform semi-automated measurement of mandibular cortical thickness (MCT) on a dental panoramic radiograph (DPR) and thereby to predict the risk of low BMD among the studied population. The study involved 76 women (mean age: 57.2 +/- 12.6years). The DPR was obtained using KODAK 8000C system. The BMD of right total hip (T-BMD) was obtained using DPX Prodigy Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) Scanner. The DPR obtained were subjected to image processing techniques to perform MCT measurement. The region of interest was manually selected around the mental foramen and enhanced using a median filter. The Ostu segmentation was performed and connected component labelling operation was performed to determine the lower boundary by finding the contour with maximum area. Subsequently, the haar wavelet operation was carried out to find the magnitude and thereby select the upper delineating cortical boundary. The Pearson test results revealed (r=0.96, p<0.01) for the standard (manual) MCT measurement against the MCT measured using the proposed semi-automated scheme. ROC analysis revealed that MCT=2.5mm could be an optimal threshold in spotting individuals at risk of low BMD. The results of the study revealed that the MCT measured on a DPR using the proposed approach could be helpful for identifying individuals at risk of low BMD.","[Kathirvelu, D.; Vinupritha, P.] SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Kattankulathur 603203, India; [Kalpana, V.] C Kandasamy Naidu Coll Women, Dept Chem, Cuddalore 607001, India","Kathirvelu, D (corresponding author), SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Kattankulathur 603203, India.",kathir297@gmail.com; vinupritha@gmail.com; retts_kalpana@gmail.com,,"dhandapani, kathirvelu/0000-0002-7652-6848",,,,22,3,3,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

If not treated, it can turn into a serious public health problem. The best method to treat asthma is to control it. Physicians recommend continuous monitoring on asthma symptoms and offering treatment preventive plans based on the patient's control level. Therefore, successful detection of the disease control level plays a critical role in presenting treatment plans. In view of this objective, we collected the data of 96 asthma patients within a 9-month period from a specialized hospital for pulmonary diseases in Tehran. A new ensemble learning algorithm with combining physicians' knowledge in the form of a rule-based classifier and supervised learning algorithms is proposed to detect asthma control level in a multivariate dataset with multiclass response variable. The model outcome resulting from the balancing operations and feature selection on data yielded the accuracy of 91.66%. Our proposed model combines medical knowledge with machine learning algorithms to classify asthma control level more accurately. This model can be applied in electronic self-care systems to support the real-time decision and personalized warnings on possible deterioration of asthma control level.

The auscultation of the heart is still an important method in the medical process because it is very simple and cheap. To detect possible heart anomalies at an early stage, an automatic method enabling cardiac health low-cost screening for the general population would be highly valuable. By analyzing the phonocardiogram signals, it is possible to perform cardiac diagnosis and find possible anomalies at an early-term. Therefore, the development of intelligent and automated analysis tools of the phonocardiogram is very relevant. In this work, we use simultaneously collected electrocardiograms and phonocardiograms from the Physionet Challenge database with the main objective of determining whether a phonocardiogram corresponds to a normal or abnormal physiological state. Our main contribution is the methodological combination of time domain features and frequency domain features of phonocardiogram signals to improve cardiac disease automatic classification. This novel approach is developed using both features. First, the phonocardiogram signals are segmented with an algorithm based on a logistic regression hidden semi-Markov model, which uses electrocardiogram signals as a reference. Then, two groups of features from the time and frequency domain are extracted from the phonocardiogram segments. One group is based on motifs and the other on Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. After that, we combine these features into a two-dimensional time-frequency heat map representation. Lastly, a binary classifier is applied to both groups of features to learn a model that discriminates between normal and abnormal phonocardiogram signals. In the experiments, three classification algorithms are used: Support Vector Machines, Convolutional Neural Network, and Random Forest. The best results are achieved when both time and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients features are considered using a Support Vector Machines with a radial kernel.","[Nogueira, Diogo Marcelo; Ferreira, Carlos Abreu; Gomes, Elsa Ferreira; Jorge, Alipio M.] INESC TEC, Campus FEUP,Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal; [Ferreira, Carlos Abreu; Gomes, Elsa Ferreira] Inst Super Engn Porto, Rua Dr Bernardino de Almeida 431, P-4200072 Porto, Portugal; [Jorge, Alipio M.] Univ Porto, Fac Ciencias, Rua Campo Alegre 1021-1055, P-4169007 Porto, Portugal","Nogueira, DM (corresponding author), INESC TEC, Campus FEUP,Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal.",diogo.m.nogueira@inesctec.pt,"Jorge, Alípio/A-1721-2008; Gomes, Elsa/AAD-1112-2020","Jorge, Alípio/0000-0002-5475-1382; Gomes, Elsa/0000-0003-3610-8788; Nogueira, Diogo Marcelo Esterlita/0000-0002-2776-900X","NanoSTIMA Project: Macro-to-Nano Human Sensing: Towards Integrated Multimodal Health Monitoring and Analytics - North Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement [NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000016]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)","This study was funded by the NanoSTIMA Project: Macro-to-Nano Human Sensing: Towards Integrated Multimodal Health Monitoring and Analytics/ NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000016 which is financed by the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, and through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).",,29,24,25,9,58,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Due to the advancement and growth of medical sciences, efficient antennas are needed for imaging, diagnosing and providing superior treatment to the patients. Since tumor is tiny in size at the early stage, the knowledge of its precise location is chiefly required. For this purpose several antennas with high accuracy are designed. Among them, Flexible antenna has several advantages compared to other antennas. The main advantage of flexible antenna is its simple construction, high gain and cost-efficiency. The proposed research work implements a novel flexible antenna for detection of early breast cancer, with and without tumor application. In the study, (for the sake of comprehensive analysis and accuracy / familiarity / simplicity), Jean material is used as dielectric substrate with dielectric constant 1.7. The flexible antennas are designed with a slot loaded over the patch and with ground plane that are made up of copper as the conducting material. The jeans cloth material with 1mm thickness is considered as a substrate, which is to be placed on the breast surface. Co-axial feeding method is chosen for the proposed antenna which improves the antenna performance. In addition to this, the antenna is a wearable textile type designed for ISM (Industrial, Scientific and Medical) band 2.4GHz applications. The antenna is simulated using HFSS (High Frequency Structure Spectrum) software. From the simulation analysis, Return loss (S-11), Gain in dB, Radiation pattern, axial ratio (AR) and VSWR are obtained and analyzed. Finally, the simulation results are compared with the existing methodologies.","[Srinivasan, Dhamodharan; Gopalakrishnan, Mohanbabu] SSM Inst Engn & Technol, Dept ECE, Dindigul, India","Srinivasan, D (corresponding author), SSM Inst Engn & Technol, Dept ECE, Dindigul, India.",dhamu20@gmail.com,"Srinivasan, Dhamodharan/ABA-2820-2021","Srinivasan, Dhamodharan/0000-0001-8811-7980",,,,23,9,9,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

As it is common amongst the younger people, early intervention and prompt diagnosis is requisite. This disease normally affects the femoral bones, in order that the bones' shape gets altered due to the fracture. Other common sites encompass knees, humerus, shoulders, jaw, and ankles. The retrieval of the AN affected bone images is challenging due to its varied fracture locations. This work proposes an effectual methodology for retrieval of AN images utilizing Deep Belief CNN Feature Representation. Initially, the input dataset undergoes preprocessing. The image noise is eradicated utilizing Median Filter (MF) and is resized in the preprocessing stage. Features are represented using Deep Belief Convolutional Neural Network (DB-CNN). Now, the image feature representations are transmuted to binary codes. Then, the similarity measurement is computed utilizing Modified-Hamming Distance. Finally, the images are retrieved centered on the similarity values.

Data owner prefers to outsource their confidential electronic data to the cloud for effective retrieval and storage without provoking the depletion or losses due to data management and maintenance. Secure data sharing and searching are vital. Be that as it may, secure search for the outsourced data is a formidable errand, which may easily incur the leakage of sensitive personal information. In this research, we propose a novel diversified access control framework composed of User Usage Based Encryption (UUBE) which is normally based on the searchable encryption scheme. In the UUBE demonstrate, Usage is mapped as credential/accreditation with time allotment to each event, where the event is considered as security trait or a privacy attribute. Data user/client can decipher an event if and only if there is a match between the accreditation and credential related to the event. A searchable encryption enables efficient routing of encrypted events using data or feature extraction algorithm as an important technique. Multicredential routing is modelled as an event dissemination strategy to strengthen weak data user confidentiality. The data user is permitted to maintain the accreditations/credentials as per their usage category. Private keys are assigned to the user/client as labels with the accreditations or credentials. A data owner/proprietor associates and relates each enciphered event with a set of credentials.","[Suresh, Dhina] St Josephs Coll Arts & Sci Women, Dept Comp Sci, Hosur, Tamil Nadu, India; [Florence, M.

The resulting damage to the small intestinal mucosa hampers nutrient absorption, and is characterized by diarrhea, abdominal pain, and a variety of extra-intestinal manifestations. Invasive and costly methods such as endoscopic biopsy are currently used to diagnose celiac disease. Detection of the disease by histopathologic analysis of biopsies can be challenging due to suboptimal sampling. Video capsule images were obtained from celiac patients and controls for comparison and classification. This study exploits the use of DAISY descriptors to project two-dimensional images onto one-dimensional vectors. Shannon entropy is then used to extract features, after which a particle swarm optimization algorithm coupled with normalization is employed to select the 30 best features for classification. Statistical measures of this paradigm were tabulated. The accuracy, positive predictive value, sensitivity and specificity obtained in distinguishing celiac versus control video capsule images were 89.82%, 89.17%, 94.35% and 83.20% respectively, using the 10-fold cross-validation technique. When employing manual methods rather than the automated means described in this study, technical limitations and inconclusive results may hamper diagnosis. Our findings suggest that the computer-aided detection system presented herein can render diagnostic information, and thus may provide clinicians with an important tool to validate a diagnosis of celiac disease.","[Vicnesh, Jahmunah; Wei, Joel Koh En; Oh, Shu Lih; Acharya, U.

We interviewed a few health professionals to gauge their reactions and to validate and understand our quantitative results. The proportion of inpatients affected by information technology is low, accounting for only 16.7% (N=43, 870). The difference between rural and urban groups is statistically significant, and rural households are more susceptible to information technology. In addition, distance has a significant positive effect. We demonstrate an inverted U-shaped relationship between severity of disease and the impact of information technology. Moreover, our interview results are consistent with our quantitative results. Quantitative and interview results suggest that health information technology plays a positive role in accessing medical care for patients with rural household and those in remote areas.

In actual fact, a considerable segment of existing information is accumulated in the text databases that have huge set of documents from different sources like research articles, news articles, books, e-mail messages, web pages and digital libraries. In many text databases, stored data are in the semi-structured format in that they are neither entirely structured nor entirely unstructured. IR (Information Retrieval) field has been growing in parallel using database systems for several years. Contrasting to the databases system fields that have concentrated mainly on transaction and query processing of the structured data, IR is concerned with firm and retrieval of data from a huge quantity of text-oriented documents. Thus, IR tackles with unstructured and/or semi-structured databases. Information security requirements within a firm have experience major variations in the past some decades. By the establishment of computer, the necessary for automated equipment for securing files as well as other information that stored on the computer turned into evident. This is particularly in case of shared information resources via public network. This is the origin for having a secure computer system / the need for computer security. Computer Security can be achieved by Intrusion Detection Systems. In this paper, we address these issues by applying Similarity Search in two diversified fields: Digital Libraries and Computer Security. The paper discusses a fast and efficient similarity search technique for approximate retrieval of books metadata in Digital Libraries. In DLI the books retrieval takes place just by using metadata such as title, year, edition, author, publishing of a book. Though, if metadata is missing, incorrect or unfinished, then it creates the library retrieval system inefficient, incorrect leads too much confusion to the user. In this context even if the query from the user matches partially or fully with a stored pattern, the information related to that be retrieved. The paper talks about a method that functions rapid and effective, language independent, and flexible library retrieval system signature based similarity search. This system is able to retrieve not only the metadata that exactly matches the query but also fairly accurate identical because of missing words, jumbled words and spell mistakes. Fundamentally, signature file approach is used here. A signature file approach looks like the most capable for huge database as it has superior text retrieval features and requires little storage overhead.","[Yellepeddi, Vijayalakshmi] Karpagam Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Manimegalai, P.] Karpagam Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Suvanam, Sasidhar Babu] SNGCE, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kadayiruppu, India","Yellepeddi, V (corresponding author), Karpagam Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.",vijayasasi11@sngce.ac.in; manimegalai.p@kahedu.edu.in; sasidharmails@sngce.ac.in,"Suvanam, Sasidhar Babu/ABF-8588-2020; P, Manimegalai/A-4723-2019","P, Manimegalai/0000-0001-6838-9591",,,,8,0,0,2,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Various studies have been conducted in many different countries with focus on both elective and non-elective surgeries. There are important variables and factors that need to be taken into considerations. Different methods and approaches have also been used to examine hospital scheduling. Notwithstanding the continuous changes in modern healthcare services and, in particular, hospital operations, consistent reviews and further studies are still required. The importance of hospital scheduling, particularly, has become more critical as the trade-off between limited resources and overwhelming demand is becoming more evident. This situation is even more pressing in a volatile country where shootings and bombings in public areas happened. Hospital scheduling for elective surgeries in volatile country such as Iraq is therefore often interrupted by non-elective surgeries due to war-related incidents. Hence, this paper intends to address this issue by proposing a hospital scheduling model with focus on neuro-surgery department. The aim of the model is to maximize utilization of operating room while concurrently minimizing idle time of surgery. The study focused on neurosurgery department in Al-Shahid Ghazi Al-Hariri hospital in Baghdad, Iraq. In doing so, a Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated where interruptions of non-elective surgery are incorporated into the main elective surgery based model. Computational experiment is then carried out to test the model. The result indicates that the model is feasible and can be solved in reasonable times. Nonetheless, its feasibility is further tested as the problems size and the computation times is getting bigger and longer. Application of heuristic methods is the way forward to ensure better practicality of the proposed model. In the end, the potential benefit of this study and the proposed model is discussed.","[Ali, Hussein Hasan] Middle Tech Univ Baghdad, Business Adm Dept, Baghdad, Iraq; [Ali, Hussein Hasan; Lamsali, Hendrik; Othman, Siti Norezam] Sch Technol Management & Logist UUM, Kedah, Malaysia","Ali, HH (corresponding author), Middle Tech Univ Baghdad, Business Adm Dept, Baghdad, Iraq.;Ali, HH (corresponding author), Sch Technol Management & Logist UUM, Kedah, Malaysia.",hussain_ha2003@yahoo.com; hendrik@uum.edu.my; norezam@uum.edu.my,"ALi, Hussein Hasan/D-6295-2019","ALi, Hussein Hasan/0000-0002-0204-6219; Lamsali, Dr Hendrik/0000-0002-9650-4697",,,,50,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In order to protect and preserve the MANET and location based services, there are various existing location based anonymity protocols such as k-anonymity location based, but these protocols are more overhead due to the dynamic mobility nature of ad-hoc networks. In this paper we proposed an Adaptive Risk Prediction and Anonymous Secured Communication protocol to predict the risk before processing anonymous communication. The proposed protocol estimates the risk against adjacent nodes and estimates the vulnerability paths using hidden markov model and decision tree. The decision tree determines the evidence to identify the trusted paths. The anonymous communication message authentication scheme assigns the anonymous communication and organize the secured authentication scheme. We simulated the network by considering different attacks to determine the efficiency of Adaptive Risk Prediction and Anonymous Secured Communication using NS2 simulator.","[Ambidi, Naveena; Katta, Rama Linga Reddy] G Narayanamma Inst Technol & Sci, Hyderabad, Telangana, India","Ambidi, N (corresponding author), G Narayanamma Inst Technol & Sci, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.",aambidinaveena@gmail.com,"Katta, Ramalinga Reddy/AAD-8597-2021; naveena, ambidi/AAE-3502-2021; naveena, ambidi/AAC-4470-2022","naveena, ambidi/0000-0002-0691-9494; Katta, Ramalinga Reddy/0000-0002-4649-4187",,,,29,0,0,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

As tumor increases in size, it induces brain damage. Hence it is essential to diagnose the type of brain tumor. The effective modality used for brain tumor diagnose is MRI because of its remarkable image resolution, the speed of acquisition, and high safety profile for patients. The analysis of brain MRI is an important part of patient care and decision. Hence in the proposed Clinical Support System, the brain MRI image is preprocessed using Genetic Optimized Median Filter followed by brain tumor region segmentation using Hierarchical Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm. The features of the tumor region are extracted through GLCM feature extraction method. Lion Optimized Boosting Support Vector machine model is used for further classification of tumor by Brain Tumor Image Segmentation (BraTS) dataset.

The present study proposes to give these splints a functional character in their design adapting them to a specific pathology, in this case to the partial rupture of Achilles tendon. It also provides a comparison against the use of conventional plaster splints as an improvement factor for their definitive implementation considering the initial sanitary use for which they were designed. In this way, there have been created therapeutic windows that allow the application of rehabilitation techniques, being the treatment that would be carried out developed in parallel. The designed splint has been made in FilaFlex and Polycarbonate, materials that guarantee comfort and resistance at the same time. In addition, an optimization in terms of material has been executed, lightening the splint and reducing environmental impact and manufacturing costs.

These disturbances will cause the final result differs from the desired one. Moreover, these disturbances, such as temperature or chamber humidity, are extremely important in case of using biocompatible materials. The use of these kind of materials with not controlled environment, can cause them to modify or loss of their properties; what will make the product unusable. Apart from these external disturbances, the conditions of the machine to which the material is subjected must also be considered, such as temperature, vibrations or extrusion speed. The monitoring of all these data will allow to know the conditions to which the product was exposed during the process. In this way, it will be able to verify the validity of the final product. For these reasons, the purpose of this work is to monitor the conditions of production of structures with biocompatible materials by fused deposition modelling (FDM) technique. This monitoring will allow us to obtain a report that guarantee the technical and geometrical characteristics of the model and the biomaterial properties. The parameters chosen to be monitored are: Diameter of filament use, temperature in extrusion nozzle, ambient temperature in closed chamber, ambient humidity in closed chamber. The obtained results, after collected and analysing the data, present variations of up to 3% in the temperature of the nozzle of the extruder with respect to set temperature. In the case of the filament diameter the difference with respect to the value provided from the filament supplier is of 13,7%.

The algorithm firstly uses the aggregate channel feature model to preprocess the image to obtain the suspected calcium area, which greatly reduces the time of single-frame image detection. The basic network VGG-16 is replaced by Resnet-50, which introduces the identity mapping to solve the problem of reducing the detection accuracy when the number of network layers are increased. Finally, the powerful and flexible two-parameter loss function is used to optimize the training deep network and improve the network model generalization ability.

Using the legacy AIMS security access log table, we studied the extent to which anesthesia providers were accessing historical anesthesia records (January 2006 - March 2017) following implementation of an EHR (April 2017). Statistical analysis was by segmented regression. At the time of implementation of the EHR, in 44.8% (SE=0.3%) of cases, there was a prior anesthetic record for the patient that had been documented in the legacy AIMS. Following EHR implementation, the mean number of preoperative clinical views of all prior anesthetic records divided by the total number of cases performed decreased to 2.3% (0.3%) from the baseline of 25.1% (0.8%). The estimated ratio of the 2 means was 0.18 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.31, P<0.00001). For views of unique records, the decrease was to 2.2% (0.3%) from the baseline of 18.3% (0.5%). The estimated ratio was 0.23 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.35, P<0.00001). These results show that, following conversion to an integrated EHR, providing access to historical anesthesia records by maintaining the legacy AIMS is not an effective strategy to promote review of such records as part of the preoperative evaluation process. Because such records provide important information for many patients, providing linked access to such records within the EHR as part of the patient encounter may be a more effective approach.","[Epstein, Richard H.] Univ Miami, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat Med & Pain Management, 1400 NW 12th Ave,Suite 3075, Miami, FL 33131 USA; [Epstein, Richard H.; Schwenk, Eric S.] Thomas Jefferson Univ, Sidney Kimmel Med Coll, Dept Anesthesiol, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Dexter, Franklin] Univ Iowa, Dept Anesthesia, Div Management Consulting, 200 Hawkins Dr,6 JCP, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Epstein, RH (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat Med & Pain Management, 1400 NW 12th Ave,Suite 3075, Miami, FL 33131 USA.;Epstein, RH (corresponding author), Thomas Jefferson Univ, Sidney Kimmel Med Coll, Dept Anesthesiol, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.",repstein@med.miami.edu; Franklin-Dexter@UIowa.edu; eric.schwenk@jefferson.edu,"Schwenk, Eric S/ABG-3425-2020; Dexter, Franklin/V-1495-2019; Epstein, Richard/AHD-1384-2022","Dexter, Franklin/0000-0001-5897-2484; Epstein, Richard/0000-0001-8466-3845; Schwenk, Eric/0000-0003-3464-4149",,,,11,2,2,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Enterprise healthcare organizations needs high compute power for the large volume of sensitive data, as well as large storage for storing both data and results, preferably in the cloud. However, security and privacy of patient data have become a critical issue that restricts many healthcare services from using cloud services to their optimal level. Therefore, this issue has limited healthcare organizations from migrating patient data to a cloud storage, because the cloud operators have chance to access sensitive data without the owner's permission. This paper proposes an intelligent security system called Intelligent Framework for Healthcare Data Security (IFHDS). IFHDS enables to secure and process large-scale data using column-based approach with less impact on the performance of data processing. The intelligent framework intends masking personal data and to encrypt sensitive data only. The proposed IFHDS splits sensitive data into multiple parts according to sensitivity level, where each part is stored separately over distributed cloud storage. Splitting data based on sensitivity level prevents cloud provider to break complete record of data if succeeds to decrypt part of data. The experimental results confirm that the proposed system secure the sensitive patient data with an acceptable computation time compared to recent security approaches.","[Essa, Youssef M.] Idealo, Berlin, Germany; [Hemdan, Ezz El-Din; El-Mahalawy, Ahmed; Attiya, Gamal; El-Sayed, Ayman] Menoufia Univ, Fac Elect Engn, Menoufia, Egypt","Essa, YM (corresponding author), Idealo, Berlin, Germany.",yosufessa@gmail.com,"Attiya, Gamal/AAE-8414-2021; EL-SAYED, Ayman E./AFM-8547-2022","ATTIYA, Gamal/0000-0002-4771-9165",,,,50,9,9,1,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

For workers in the building sector, the repetitive movements and displacements occur under load and unnatural postures of the shoulder joint. For this reason, this study aims to model in 3D the biological components which form the shoulder joint for the later finite element analysis. Three cases with different loads have been considered for this study. Due to a linear and isotropic joint approach it has been possible to evaluate the tensions in the main components of the shoulders: muscles, tendons and ligaments. The methodology used allowed obtaining an improved mesh of the shoulder joint to analyse real situations with finite element method analysis with applications in the field of sports medicine, work, etc. Furthermore, the simplification adopted for modelling the joint muscles, as 1D elements in the finite element model has made it possible to establish different positions of human joint without mesh again each of the studied positions. The results are consistent with the states of applied loads. In fact, the maximum stresses in bones are in the insertion areas of the ligaments. Due to the static positions of the joint under study, the muscles do not support high stresses. According to the stresses distribution, the maximum values are in the zones of tendons. From the result analysis, it is observed how the stresses distribution in the cartilage area maintains coherence with reality since the maximum stresses appear in the lower half of the cartilage. In this area in which the Humerus-scapula contact is greater, the compression tensions are greater.","[Islan Marcos, Manuel; Lechosa Urquijo, Emilio; Blaya Haro, Fernando; D'Amato, Roberto] Univ Politecn Madrid, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn & Diseno Ind, Ronda Valencia 3, Madrid 28012, Spain; [Soriano Heras, Enrique] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Ingn Mecan, Avda Univ 30, Madrid 28911, Spain; [Antonio Juanes, Juan] Univ Salamanca, Campus Miguel Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain","Marcos, MI; D'Amato, R (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn & Diseno Ind, Ronda Valencia 3, Madrid 28012, Spain.;Juanes, JA (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Campus Miguel Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain.",manuel.islan.marcos@upm.es; emilio.lechosa@upm.es; fernando.blaya@upm.es; r.damato@upm.es; esoriano@ing.uc3m.es; jajm@usal.es,"D'Amato, Roberto/L-9153-2014; Heras, Enrique Soriano/O-6126-2018; Juanes, Juan A/D-8675-2018","D'Amato, Roberto/0000-0001-8090-922X; Heras, Enrique Soriano/0000-0003-3309-7518; Juanes, Juan A/0000-0003-2749-3426",,,,12,3,3,3,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In recent years, many machine learning-based automatic MR brain image segmentation methods have been proposed as auxiliary methods of medical image analysis in clinical treatment. Nevertheless, many problems regarding precise medical images, which cannot be effectively utilized to improve partition performance, remain to be solved. Due to the poor contrast in grayscale images, the ambiguity and complexity of MR images, and individual variability, the performance of classic algorithms in medical image segmentation still needs improvement. In this paper, we introduce a distributed multitask fuzzy c-means (MT-FCM) clustering algorithm for MR brain image segmentation that can extract knowledge common among different clustering tasks. The proposed distributed MT-FCM algorithm can effectively exploit information common among different but related MR brain image segmentation tasks and can avoid the negative effects caused by noisy data that exist in some MR images. Experimental results on clinical MR brain images demonstrate that the distributed MT-FCM method demonstrates more desirable performance than the classic signal task method.","[Jiang, Yizhang; Zhao, Kaifa; Qian, Pengjiang] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Digital Media, 1800 Lihu Ave, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xia, Kaijian] Changshu 1 Peoples Hosp, Changshu 215500, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xue, Jing] Nanjing Med Univ, Affiliated Wuxi Peoples Hosp, Dept Nephrol, 299 Qingyang Rd, Wuxi 214023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Leyuan; Ding, Yang] Jiangnan Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Radiotherapy, 200 Huihe Rd, Wuxi 214062, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Qian, PJ (corresponding author), Jiangnan Univ, Sch Digital Media, 1800 Lihu Ave, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",qianpjiang@jiangnan.edu.cn,"Qian, Pengjiang/AAC-1399-2020; Jiang, Yizhang/V-2171-2019","Jiang, Yizhang/0000-0002-4558-9803; Qian, Pengjiang/0000-0002-5596-3694; ZHAO, Kaifa/0000-0002-3102-7498; Xia, Kaijian/0000-0002-1650-9982","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61702225, 61772241]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20160187]; 2018 Six Talent Peaks Project of Jiangsu Province [XYDXX-127]; Science and technology demonstration project of social development of Wuxi [WX18IVJN002]; Youth Foundation of the Commission of Health and Family Planning of Wuxi [Q201654]; Jiangsu Committee of Health [H2018071]","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 61702225 and 61772241, by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province under Grant BK20160187, by the 2018 Six Talent Peaks Project of Jiangsu Province under Grant XYDXX-127, by the Science and technology demonstration project of social development of Wuxi under Grant WX18IVJN002,by the Youth Foundation of the Commission of Health and Family Planning of Wuxi under Grant Q201654, and by the Jiangsu Committee of Health under Grant H2018071.",,26,73,75,7,45,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

However, the radiation problems of wireless devices, the power supply problems of wearable devices and the deployment of body area networks have become obstacles to their wide application in the field of health care. In order to solve the above problems, this paper studies and designs a wearable health medical body area network which is convenient for human health monitoring and medical care, starting from low-cost deployment of wireless wearable devices and active control of wireless radiation. Firstly, in order to avoid replacing equipment batteries, improve the relay and data aggregation capabilities of wireless body area network, and reduce the communication and computing load of edge devices, a deployment scheme of wireless medical health wearable devices is designed based on the optimal segmentation algorithm of Steiner spanning tree. Then, in order to minimize the charging cost and maximize the global charging utility of single source and multiple points in a finite time slot, an approximate algorithm for the optimal charging sequence based on 01 knapsack problem, i.e., the access path of wireless wearable devices, is designed. Then, an active radiation control algorithm for wearable medical health body area network is proposed, which can actively control the transmission power and radiation status of these wireless devices. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is better than battery-powered wireless body area network and wireless rechargeable body area network, 16% and 44% reduction of devices, 25%(sic)13% reduction of energy consumption, 26% reduction of radiation, and 5.18 and 1.13 times improvement of signal quality.","[Jin, Yong] Changshu Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Changshu 215500, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Jin, Y (corresponding author), Changshu Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Changshu 215500, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jinyong@cslg.cn,,,Jiangsu Students' innovation and entrepreneurship training program [201810333029Y],The authors would like to thank the support from the Jiangsu Students' innovation and entrepreneurship training program (NO. 201810333029Y).,,18,7,7,3,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

With the availability of large volume of health care datasets and progressions in deep learning techniques, systems are now well equipped in diagnosing many health problems. Utilizing the intensity of substantial historical information in electronic health record (EHR), we built up, a conventional predictive temporal model utilizing recurrent neural systems (RNN) like LSTM and connected to longitudinal time stepped EHR. Experience records were contribution to RNN to anticipate the analysis and prescription classes for a resulting visit during heart disappointment (e.g. diagnosis codes, drug codes or method codes). In this paper, we also investigated whether use of deep learning to model temporal relations among events in electronic health records (EHRs) would enhance the model performance in predicting initial diagnosis of heart failure (HF) compared to some of the traditional methods that disregard temporality. By examining these time stamped EHRs, we could recognize the associations between various diagnosis occasions and finally predicate when a patient is being analyzed for a disease. In any case, it is hard to access the current EHR data straightforwardly, since almost all data are sparse and not standardized. Along these lines, we proposed a robust model for prediction of heart failure. The fundamental commitment of this paper is to predict the failure of heart by means of a neural network model based on patient's electronic medicinal information. In order to, demonstrate the diagnosis events and prediction of heart failure, we used the medical concept vectors and the essential standards of a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep network model. The proposed LSTM model uses SiLU and tanh as activation function in the hidden layers and Softmax in output layer in the network. Bridgeout is used as a regularization technique for weight optimization throughout the network. Assessments subject to the real-time data exhibit the favorable effectiveness and feasibility of recommended model in the risk of heart failure prediction. The results showed improved accuracy in heart failure detection and the model performance is compared using the existing deep learning models. Enhanced prior detection could expose novel chances for deferring or anticipating movement to analysis of heart failure and diminish cost.","[Maragatham, G.; Devi, Shobana] SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Informat & Technol, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","Maragatham, G (corresponding author), SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Informat & Technol, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.",maragathamhaarish@gmail.com; shobanak07@gmail.com,"Maragatham, G./ABC-6758-2021; Ayyavu, Shobanadevi/ABB-2623-2021",,,,,63,51,52,5,66,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

However, selected patients have good response to oral appliances devices that intended to protrude and stabilize the mandible mechanically during the night in order to reduce the collapsibility of the upper airway. Selection of patients includes primary snoring, mild, moderate and positional apnea. The perfect mandibular advance device has not yet been designed. For these reasons, the objective of this paper is to present a new thermoadjustable chair-side oral appliance. Device integrates the best characteristics of custom made and boils and bite previous designs and minimizes inconveniences and possible side effects. The device is a titratable mandibular advancement appliance. It consists of two independent prefabricated trays adaptable to the shape of adult dental arch and linked to each other by a protrusion mechanism. Each tray contains a hard outer shell and a soft thermoplastic resin inner body. The position of the jaw can be adjusted by moving an aluminum rack into, or out from, the guide so the ratchet may get locked into a certain position ensuring the length of the mechanism. The protrusion mechanism is fixed to the splint using small rings that are articulated over a t button. Our prototype satisfies the requirements of an effective oral appliance, in terms of retention, comfort, safety and efficacy. It is easy to fit, durable, low cost, quickly titratable, not bulky and easy cleaning. Thermoplastic appliances are specially used like a predictor of treatment response in apnea patients.

This paper presents automatic glioma tumor grade identification from magnetic resonant images using Wndchrm tool based classifier (Weighted Neighbour Distance using Compound Heirarchy of Algorithms Representing Morphology) and VGG-19 deep convolutional neural network (DNN). For experimentation, DICOM images are collected from reputed government hospital and the proposed intelligent system categorized the tumor into four grades such as low grade glioma, oligodendroglioma, anaplastic glioma and glioblastoma multiform. After preprocessing, features are extracted, optimized and then classified using Windchrm tool where the most significant features are selected on the basis of Fisher score. In the case of DNN classifier, data augmentation is also performed before applying the images into the deep learning network. The performance of the classifiers are analysed with various measures such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity and F1-score. The results showed reasonably good performance with a maximum classification accuracy of 92.86% for the Wndchrm classifier and 98.25% for VGG-19 DNN classifier. The results are also compared with similar recent works and the proposed system is found to have better performance.","[Muneer, Ahammed K., V; Joseph, Paul K.] Natl Inst Technol Calicut, Dept Elect Engn, Calicut 673601, Kerala, India; [Rajendran, V.

They involve a magnetic resonance sequence called diffusion tensor imaging. In order to process the data provided by this sequence it is necessary to use software that can post-process the image and render three-dimensional images of the central nervous system pathways. Thanks to this sequence it has been possible to isolate over the years many nerve pathways that cross the brain tissue, particularly those which occupy a significant space. This sequence could have a large variety of uses, such as helping with the study of brain anatomy, assisting with surgery planning, or establishing a relationship between the nerve fibers and tumoral lesions. However, there has been an increasing number of cases that report a low reliability related to the tractographic representation of this technique. Our goal with this article is to analyse a specific nerve pathway, the piramidal tract, in order to assess the coherence between the images obtained and the anatomy that is already known from the perspective of the radiological image, and to compare this tract between different patients.","[Muradas Mujika, Katrin; Framinan de Miguel, Andres] Univ Healthcare Complex Salamanca, Paseo San Vicente 58-182, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Juanes Mendez, Juan Antonio] Univ Salamanca, Sch Med, VisualMed Syst Grp, Ave Alfonso X el Sabio S-N, Salamanca 37007, Spain","Mujika, KM (corresponding author), Univ Healthcare Complex Salamanca, Paseo San Vicente 58-182, Salamanca 37007, Spain.",katrin.muradas@gmail.com; jajm@usal.es; frami@usal.es,"Framinan, andres/AAB-8365-2021; Juanes, Juan A/D-8675-2018","Framinan, andres/0000-0002-1522-191X; Juanes, Juan A/0000-0003-2749-3426",,,,14,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

It continues to stump medical practitioners on the pretext of its relevance with pericardial fat and its dependence on a numerous other parameters including ethnicity and physique of an individual. This calls for a fool-proof algorithm that promises accurate classification and segmentation, hence an immaculate prediction. CT is immensely popular and widely preferred for diagnosis. Implementation of an improvised algorithm in CT would be a natural necessity. This research work proposes a Fruitfly Algorithm based Modified region growing algorithm is applied to the acquired CT images to segment fat accurately. The proposed methodology promises image registration and classification in order to segment two cardiac fats namely epicardial, pericardial and mediastinal. The main contributions are (1) Fat feature extraction: Construction of GLCM features CT image (2) Development of GWO based optimal neural network for classification; (3) Modeling the fat segmentation using modified region growing algorithm with Fruitfly optimization. The entire experimentation has been implemented in MATLAB simulation environment and final result is expected to flaunt a definite distinction between cardiac mediastinal and epicardial fats. Parallely, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, FPR and FNR have been stated and contrasted methodically with the existing methodology.

The main focus in transforming traditional healthcare to smart healthcare is on facilitating the patients as well as medical professionals. However, this changover is not easy due to various issues of security and integrity associated with it. Security of patients's personal health record and privacy can be handled well by permitting only authorized access to the confidential health-data via suitably designed authentication scheme. In pursuit to contribute in this direction, we came across the role of Universal Serial Bus (USB), the most widely accepted interface, in enabling communication between peripheral devices and a host controller like laptop, personal computer, smart phone, tablet etc. In the process, we analysed a recently proposed a three-factor authentication scheme for consumer USB Mass Storage Devices (MSD) by He et al. In this paper, we demonstrate that He et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to leakage of temporary but session specific information attacks, late detection of message replay, forward secrecy attacks, and backward secrecy attacks. Then motivated with the benefits of USB, we propose a secure three-factor authentication scheme for smart healthcare.","[Renuka, Km; Kumari, Saru] Chaudhary Charan Singh Univ, Dept Math, Meerut 250004, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Li, Xiong] Hunan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Xiangtan 411201, Peoples R China","Li, X (corresponding author), Hunan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Xiangtan 411201, Peoples R China.",baliyanrenuka@gmail.com; saryusiirohi@gmail.com; lixiongzhq@163.com,"Li, Xiong/K-7233-2012; Kumari, Saru/K-2038-2019","Li, Xiong/0000-0001-6619-554X; Kumari, Saru/0000-0003-4929-5383",Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (CN) [2018JJ3191] Funding Source: Medline,,,33,24,24,1,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Some falls result in injuries and the cost associated with their treatment is high. This is a complex problem that requires several steps in order to be tackled. Firstly, it is crucial to develop strategies that recognize the locomotion mode, indicating the state of the subject in various situations. This article aims to develop a strategy capable of identifying normal gait, the pre-fall condition, and the fall situation, based on a wearable system (IMUs-based). This system was used to collect data from healthy subjects that mimicked falls. The strategy consists, essentially, in the construction and use of classifiers as tools for recognizing the locomotion modes. Two approaches were explored. Associative Skill Memories (ASMs) based classifier and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier based on deep learning. Finally, these classifiers were compared, providing for a tool with a good accuracy in recognizing the locomotion modes. Results have shown that the accuracy of the classifiers was quite acceptable. The CNN presented the best results with 92.71% of accuracy considering the pre-fall step different from normal steps, and 100% when not considering.","[Ribeiro, Nuno Ferrete; Andre, Joao; Santos, Cristina P.] Univ Minho, Ctr MicroElectroMech Syst CMEMS, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal; [Costa, Lino] Univ Minho, Prod & Syst Dept, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal","Ribeiro, NF (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Ctr MicroElectroMech Syst CMEMS, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal.",nuno.ferrete.ribeiro@gmail.com,"Santos, Cristina P/L-8716-2014; Costa, Lino/D-2248-2009; Ribeiro, Nuno Ferrete/AAP-9872-2020","Santos, Cristina P/0000-0003-0023-7203; Costa, Lino/0000-0003-4772-4404; Ribeiro, Nuno Ferrete/0000-0003-4177-2587",FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [PD/BD/141515/2018]; FEDER funds through the COMPETE 2020 - Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao (POCI); P2020; COMPETE 2020 POCI [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006941]; Reference Project EML [POCI-01-0247-FEDER-033067],"This work has been supported by the FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia - with the scholarship reference PD/BD/141515/2018, by the FEDER funds through the COMPETE 2020 - Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalizacao (POCI) and P2020 with the Reference Project EML under Grant POCI-01-0247-FEDER-033067, and through the COMPETE 2020 POCI with the Reference Project under Grant POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006941.",,54,2,3,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

It is modified throughout life and it is determined by the particular anatomical characteristics that directly affect the biomechanics of the spine. The typing of the spinal curvature is important for the knowledge of body posture. The possibility of having a method for the systematic postural characterization of the spine is an essential objective resource in order to obtain normal or control patterns of the spinal morphology of the population. A widely accepted methodology of morphological characterization of the spine is a necessary requirement for the establishment of preventive criteria for spinal pathologies based on epidemiological population studies. It also represents a necessary requirement for the classification of individuals, based on the biomechanical, orthopaedic or ergonomic criteria necessary for disciplines such as sports, industrial design or sports performance. The present study proposes the development of a morphological postural model of the spine in the lumbar region. The model is based on a system of measurement of objective and comparable parameters by means of X-ray analysis, in order to characterize its morphology in the sagittal plane. The comparison of the results in a population of 47 individuals allowed the possibility to carry out a statistical study on three morphological parameters: sacral angle (1); reversal angle ((2)) and degree of lordosis (D-L). The statistical hypothesis that the results behave according to a normal distribution with p<0.05 is relevant and allows the systematization and postural modelling of the individual.","[San Pedro, Pilar; Blaya, Fernando; D'Amato, Roberto] Tech Univ Madrid, Madrid 28012, Spain; [Juanes, Juan A.] Univ Salamanca, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Gallego Morales, Luis Tomas; Rodriguez Montes, Jose Antonio] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Hosp Univ La Paz, Madrid 28046, Spain","D'Amato, R (corresponding author), Tech Univ Madrid, Madrid 28012, Spain.",pilarsanpedro@yahoo.es; Fernando.blaya@upm.es; r.damato@upm.es; jajm@usal.es; luis.gallego@salud.madrid.org; rodriguezmontes@gmail.com,"D'Amato, Roberto/L-9153-2014; Juanes, Juan A/D-8675-2018","D'Amato, Roberto/0000-0001-8090-922X; Juanes, Juan A/0000-0003-2749-3426",,,,23,1,1,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

These pieces will be resistant, lightweight and may have geometries more complex than those created with traditional systems of composite material. The new system is based on the union of two heads on a 3D Rep-Rap printer. One of the heads is an extruder head of thermoplastic Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) and the other is a dosing head, based on the Robocasting technique, designed to be assembled on the 3D printer. Thermoplastics material and epoxy resin will be used. The alternate printing of both materials generates a piece of composite material. This new technique will allow to increase the structural properties of the piece in the XY plane. The new additive manufacturing system allows to obtain mechanical improvements both in the modulus of elasticity and in the tensile strength. Increase the modulus of elasticity of a value between 50 and 80% depending on the thermoplastic filament used. In the same way the tensile strength has increased between 50 and 60%. The improvement in the strength / weight ratio allows to this new additive manufacturing system to create medical pieces in which the lightness and resistance are its main characteristic, such as orthopedic prostheses.The results show that the use of FFF together with Robocasting, as a manufacturing process for end-use parts, generates an additional advantage that had not been considered until now. The combination of a thermoplastic and an epoxy resin opens a new path in the additive manufacturing since it allows creating pieces with new qualities without being conditioned by the design.","[Sanchez Ramirez, Alberto] ETSIAE UPM, Sch Aeronaut & Space Engn, Madrid, Spain; [D'Amato, Roberto; Blaya Haro, Fernando; Islan Marcos, Manuel] Tech Univ Madrid, Madrid 28012, Spain; [Juanes, Juan A.] Univ Salamanca, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain","D'Amato, R (corresponding author), Tech Univ Madrid, Madrid 28012, Spain.",alberto.sanchezr@upm.es; r.damato@upm.es; fernando.blaya@upm.es; manuel.islan.marcos@upm.es; jajm@usal.es,"Sanchez, Alberto/R-9833-2018; D'Amato, Roberto/L-9153-2014; Juanes, Juan A/D-8675-2018","D'Amato, Roberto/0000-0001-8090-922X; Juanes, Juan A/0000-0003-2749-3426",,,,53,4,4,3,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In the proposed work, a cloud based system is proposed for automatic and real-time screening of Glaucoma with the use of automatic image processing techniques. The proposed system offers scalability to the developers and easy accessibility to the consumers. The proposed system is device and location independent. The input digital image is analyzed and a comprehensive diagnostic report is generated consisting of detailed analysis of indicative medical parameters like optic-cup-to-disc ratio, optic neuro-retinal rim, ISNT rules making the report informative and clinically significant. With recent advances in the field of communication technologies, the internet facilities are available that make the proposed system an efficient and economical method for initial screening and offer preventive and diagnostic steps in early disease intervention and management.

One of the most important issues faced by the biometric system developer is to protect the template obtained from the biometric of a person. Unimodal biometric system has some drawbacks such as noisy data, interclass variations and spoof attack. Multimodal biometric system has been developed to address the boundaries of unimodal biometric system and increase the security of template. In this paper, template security analysis of multimodal biometric system based of fingerprint and palmprint is proposed and implemented. Fuzzy vault scheme is employed to protect both the fingerprint and palmprint template. At enrollment, image processing techniques such as image enhancement, segmentation and bottom-hat filtering are applied on both the biometric to improve the quality and subsequently the most important features are extracted. Extracted features are concatenated. Combined features along with secret key are utilized to generate the database in the vault. During authentication, query images are sent as an input with the stored template to recover the key. Experimental results are shown that the proposed multi biometrics system performs well than the other methods considered for comparison.","[Sujitha, V.; Chitra, D.] PA Coll Engn & Technol, Dept CSE, Pollachi, Tamil Nadu, India","Sujitha, V (corresponding author), PA Coll Engn & Technol, Dept CSE, Pollachi, Tamil Nadu, India.",sujithavpacet@gmail.com; chitrapacet@gmail.com,"D, CHITRA/AAG-2596-2020; v, Sujitha/AAI-5127-2021","v, Sujitha/0000-0003-2416-2322",,,,24,5,5,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In actual usage, a PEKS scheme should be employed with a PKE scheme since PEKS itself does not support the decryption of data. Since a naive composition of a PEKS ciphertext and a PKE ciphertext does not provide CCA security, several attempts have been made to integrate PEKS and PKE in a joint CCA manner (PEKS/PKE for short). In this paper, we further extend these works by integrating secure-channel free PEKS (SCF-PEKS) and PKE, which we call SCF-PEKS/PKE, where no secure channel is required to send trapdoors. We give a formal security definition of SCF-PEKS/PKE in a joint CCA manner, and propose a generic construction of SCF-PEKS/PKE based on anonymous identity-based encryption, tag-based encryption, and one-time signature. We also strengthen the current consistency definition according to the secure-channel free property, and show that our construction is strongly consistent if the underlying IBE provides unrestricted strong collision-freeness which is defined in this paper. We also show that such an IBE scheme can be constructed by employing the Abdalla et al. transformations (TCC 2010/J. Cryptology 2018). Finally, as an application of SCF-PEKS/PKE, we strengthen the security of encrypted Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system proposed by Guo and Yau (J.

With the help of these health data, eHealthcare provider can offer reliable data service (e.g., k-NN query) to doctors for better diagnosis. However, the IT facility in the eHealthcare provider is incompetent with the huge volumes of eHealthcare data, so one popular solution is to deploy a powerful cloud and appoint the cloud to execute the k-NN query service. In this case, since the eHealthcare data are very sensitive yet cloud servers are not fully trusted, directly executing the k-NN query service in the cloud inevitably incurs privacy challenges. Apart from the privacy issues, efficiency issues also need to be taken into consideration because achieving privacy requirement will incur additional computational cost. However, existing focuses on k-NN query do not (fully) consider the data privacy or are inefficient. For instance, the best computational complexity of k-NN query over encrypted eHealthcare data in the cloud is as large as O(k log(3) N), where N is the total number of data. In this paper, aiming at addressing the privacy and efficiency challenges, we design an efficient and privacy-preserving k-NN query scheme for encrypted outsourced eHealthcare data. Our proposed scheme is characterized by integrating the kd-tree with the homomorphic encryption technique for efficient storing encrypted data in the cloud and processing privacy-preserving k-NN query over encrypted data. Compared with existing works, our proposed scheme is more efficient in terms of privacy-preserving k-NN query. Specifically, our proposed scheme can achieve k-NN computation over encrypted data with O(lk log N) computational complexity, where l and N respectively denote the data dimension and the total number of data. In addition, detailed security analysis shows that our proposed scheme is really privacy-preserving under our security model and performance evaluation also indicates that our proposed scheme is indeed efficient in terms of computational cost.","[Zheng, Yandong; Lu, Rongxing] Univ New Brunswick, Fac Comp Sci, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada; [Shao, Jun] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Lu, RX (corresponding author), Univ New Brunswick, Fac Comp Sci, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada.",rlu1@unb.ca,,,NSERC [04009]; NBIf Start-Up Grant [Rif 2017-012]; ZJNSF [LZ18F020003]; NSFC [61472364];  [HMF2017 YS-04];  [LMCRF-S-2018-03],"This research was supported in part by NSERC Discovery Grants (04009), NBIf Start-Up Grant (Rif 2017-012), HMF2017 YS-04, LMCRF-S-2018-03, ZJNSF under Grant LZ18F020003 and NSFC under Grants 61472364.",,23,20,20,2,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

However, lack of radiological expertise in TB detection leads to indiscriminate chest radiograph (CXR) screening. A modest classification approach based on the local image description to detect subtle characteristics of TB using CXRs is highly recommended. In this work, an attempt has been made to classify normal and TB CXR images using Bag of Features (BoF) approach with Speeded-Up Robust Feature (SURF) descriptor. The images are obtained from a public database. Lung fields segmentation is performed using Distance Regularized Level Set (DRLS) formulation. The results of segmentation are validated against the ground truth images using similarity, overlap and area correlation measures. BoF approach with SURF keypoint descriptors is implemented to categorize the images using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier. The obtained results demonstrate that the DRLS method is able to delineate lung fields from CXR images. The BoF with SURF keypoint descriptor is able to characterize local attributes of normal and TB images. The segmentation results are found to be in high correlation with ground truth. MLP classifier is found to provide high Recall, Specificity (Spec), Accuracy, F-score and Area Under the Curve (AUC) values of 87.7%, 85.9%, 87.8%, 87.6% and 94% respectively between normal and abnormal images. The proposed computer aided diagnostic approach is found to perform better as compared to the existing methods. Thus, the study can be of significant assistance to physicians at the point of care in resource constrained regions.","[Govindarajan, Satyavratan; Swaminathan, Ramakrishnan] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Appl Mech, Biomed Engn Grp, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India","Govindarajan, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Appl Mech, Biomed Engn Grp, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.",s.vratan@gmail.com,"Swaminathan, Ramakrishnan/C-8054-2013","GOVINDARAJAN, SATYAVRATAN/0000-0002-2609-7213","Science and Engineering Research Board, Department of Science & Technology, Government of India [SERB-SB/S3/EECE/291/201]","This study is funded by Science and Engineering Research Board, Department of Science & Technology, Government of India (SERB-SB/S3/EECE/291/201).",,38,9,9,1,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In this study, we propose a new counting method, which consists of three modules including localization, segmentation and classification. The localization of BMC is achieved from a color transformation enhanced BMC sample image and stepwise averaging method. In the nucleus segmentation, both stepwise averaging method and Otsu's method are applied to obtain a weighted threshold for segmenting the patch into nucleus and non-nucleus. In the cytoplasm segmentation, a color weakening transformation, an improved region growing method and the K-Means algorithm are employed. The connected cells with BMC will be separated by the marker-controlled watershed algorithm. The features will be extracted for the classification after the segmentation. In this study, the BMC are classified using the support vector machine into five classes; namely, neutrophilic split granulocyte, neutrophilic stab granulocyte, metarubricyte, mature lymphocytes and the outlier (all other cells not listed).

The short piece of review from the user can help a business determine or understand the attitude of the user thereby predict the customer's behaviour and itsubstantiallyimproves the quality of service parameters. The proposed Robust User Sentiment Biterm Topic Mixture (RUSBTM)model discovers the user preference and their sentiment orientation views for effective Topic Modelling using Biterms or word-pair from the short text of a particular venue. Since short review or text suffers from data sparse, the user aggregation strategy is adapted to form a pseudo document and the word pairset is created for the whole corpus. The RUSBTM learns topics by generating the word co-occurrence patterns thereby inferring topics with rich corpus-level information. By analysing the sentiments of the paired words and their corresponding topics in the review corpus of the particular venue, prediction can be done that exactly portrays the user interest, preference and expectation from a particular venue. The RUSBTM model proved to be more robust and also, the extracted topics are more coherent and informative. Also the method uses accurate sentiment polarity techniques to exactly capture the sentiment orientation and the model proves to be outperforming better when compared to other state of art methods.","[Nimala, K.; Jebakumar, R.] SRM Univ, Sch Comp, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","Nimala, K (corresponding author), SRM Univ, Sch Comp, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.",nimskt@gmail.com,"R, JEBAKUMAR/ABE-8759-2021","R, JEBAKUMAR/0000-0002-1570-2561",,,,25,4,5,7,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis is carried out with the physiological parameters of blood oxygen metabolism function and bone marrow blood perfusion as independent variables and BMD as dependent variables. It is found that there are significant differences in oxygen metabolism between individual muscles in different BMD groups and between skeletal muscles of different types of muscle fibers.

Dental biotribology, has been one of the most important branches in biotribology in recent years. The aim of this research is to investigate the tribological performances in the tooth-to-tooth contact and material-to-natural tooth contact (zirconia vs. zirconia and natural tooth vs. zirconia). The presented research was carried out by testing the above mentioned tribological pairs with the use of a reciprocating tribometer under lubricated conditions (artificial saliva). The normal force used in the tests was 20N the time for each test was of 60min. The stroke length was 2mm, according to the range of displacement used in scientific literature. The wear mass loss evaluation was evaluated by using a gravimetric method. In order to characterize the wear mechanisms, present in the worn surfaces after each of tribo-tests, a topographic analysis was carried with a 3D non-contact optical profiler. The results show that the minimum value of the COF is obtained in the case of Zirconia vs. Zirconia tribo-couple. The results on the wear mass loss show a very low wear rate when coupling in tribological condition natural tooth with a ceramic restoration (a mean value of 0.5mg was found). This rate is even lower when the contact is between two artificial zirconia teeth.","[Ruggiero, Alessandro] Univ Salerno, Dept Ind Engn, I-84084 Fisciano, Italy; [D'Amato, Roberto; Blaya Haro, Fernando] Tech Univ Madrid, Madrid 28012, Spain; [Sbordone, Ludovico; Lanza, Antonio] Univ Salerno, Dept Med Surg & Dent Schola Med Salernitana, Sch Dent, Via S Allende, I-84081 Salerno, Italy","D'Amato, R (corresponding author), Tech Univ Madrid, Madrid 28012, Spain.",ruggiero@unisa.it; r.damato@upm.es; lsbordone@unisa.it; fernando.blaya@upm.es; alanza@unisa.it,"D'Amato, Roberto/L-9153-2014; Ruggiero, Alessandro/I-7411-2015","D'Amato, Roberto/0000-0001-8090-922X; Ruggiero, Alessandro/0000-0002-5111-2331; Lanza, Antonio/0000-0002-2935-4668",,,,38,7,7,7,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The present research aimed to analyze the psychophysiological response and the variations in specific fine motor skill after a checkpoint simulation which included surveillance, unexpected attacks, and melee combat. Psychophysiological parameters -heart rate, blood glucose, pressure, oxygen saturation, and lactate, legs ' strength, skin temperature, cortical activation, anxiety-, as well as fine motor skills were analyzed in a sample of 24 professional Spanish Army soldiers (35.67 +/- 6.62years, 177.21 +/- 7.37cm, 82.29 +/- 11.02kg, 26.17 +/- 2.82 BMI, 15.25 +/- 7.44years of experience in their unit) before and after a checkpoint simulation. The checkpoint surveillance operation produced a significant increase (p<0.05) in rated perceived exertion, heart rate, blood lactate concentration, legs ' strength and somatic anxiety, and a significant decrease in blood oxygen saturation and skin temperature values. We concluded that results were consistent with an activation of sympathetic nervous system, triggering a fight-flight response, a chain of intense psychophysiological reactions and a misinterpretation of perceived exertion.

Specifically, we reuse existing knowledge bases to alleviate the difficulties in building a high-quality knowledge graph, ranging in size up to 7 million edges. Then we design a prediction model to explore the pharmacology features and knowledge graph features. Finally, we propose a user interaction model to allow the user to better understand the drug properties from a drug similarity perspective and gain insights that are not easily observable in individual drugs.

The benign brain tumor does not affect the adjacent normal and healthy tissue but the malignant tumor can affect the neighboring tissues of brain that can lead to the death of person. An early detection of brain tumor can be required to protect the survival of patients. Usually, the brain tumor is detected using MRI scanning method. However, the radiologists are not providing the effective tumor segmentation in MRI image due to the irregular shape of tumors and position of tumor in the brain. Accurate brain tumor segmentation is needed to locate the tumor and it is used to give the correct treatment for a patient and it provides the key to the doctor who must execute the surgery for patient. In this paper, a novel deep learning algorithm (kernel based CNN) with M-SVM is presented to segment the tumor automatically and efficiently. This presented work contains several steps that are preprocessing, feature extraction, image classification and tumor segmentation of brain. The MRI image is smoothed and enhanced by Laplacian of Gaussian filtering method (LoG) with Contrast Limited Adaptive Histrogram Equalization (CLAHE) and feature can be extracted from it based on tumor shape position, shape and surface features in brain. Consequently, the image classification is done using M-SVM depending on the selected features. From MRI image, the tumor is segmented with help of kernel based CNN method.. Experimental results of proposed method can show that this presented technique can executes brain tumor segmentation accurately reaching almost 84% in evaluation with existing algorithms.","[Thillaikkarasi, R.] Salem Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Salem, India; [Saravanan, S.] Muthayammal Engn Coll Rasipuram, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Rasipuram, India","Thillaikkarasi, R (corresponding author), Salem Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Salem, India.",rthillaikkarasiscet@gmail.com,"S, Saravanan/AAA-7962-2021","siddhan, saravanan/0000-0003-2022-6202",,,,20,30,30,8,40,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Such data gathers continuously in search space making traditional algorithms infeasible for data mining in real time environment. Hence, feature selection is an important method to lighten the load during processing while inducing a model for mining. However, mining over such high dimensional data leads to formulation of optimal feature subset, which grows exponentially and leads to intractable computational demand. In this paper, a novel lightweight mechanism is used as a feature selection method, which solves the after effects arising with optimal feature selection. The feature selection in big data mining is done using accelerated flower pollination (AFP) algorithm. This method improves the accuracy of feature selection with reduced processing time. The proposed method is tested under larger set of data with high dimensionality to test the performance of proposed method.","[Venkatasalam, K.] Mahendra Engn Coll, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Namakkal 637503, India; [Rajendran, P.] Knowledge Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Kakapalayam, India; [Thangavel, M.] Knowledge Inst Technol, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Kakapalayam, India","Venkatasalam, K (corresponding author), Mahendra Engn Coll, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Namakkal 637503, India.",venkatasalamk@mahendra.info,,,,,,34,4,4,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Conventional features on BCC are concentrated mostly on modeling of channels by using of an efficient measurement technique, wireless transceiver design and then by means of a transmission technique. Particularly, the wireless digital transmitting, developed as a personalized method intended for the body channel, offers wanted to develop flexible and low power BCC systems. With the developing level of wearable communication protocol and applications, there may be an increasingly reliable on an adaptable BCC transmitter that helps both data reconfigure power and power reduction condition. In this paper, an extremely reconfigurable Hamming Encoding Digital Transmitter (HEDT) which works with both reconfigurable data and power reduction condition that supports from two innovative operation conditions is suggested. In a HEDT device, the overall data rate is controlled by the level of Hamming codes designed to make use of in the perfect BCC band of 20-100MHz. The proposed Hamming Encoded Transmission method achieves seven times improved data rate when compared with conventional BCC processors. The next unique implementation technique is based on the usage of Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) of a Hamming encoded HEDT approach. This approach permits the BCC transceiver to use the perfect channel with bandwidth among 40-100MHz. Thereby half the clock rate reduces 40% of overall power utilization. The HEDT system is completely designed in a 65nm CMOS procedure. It uses a primary area of 0.14x0.2mm. When functioning below a data-rate of 60Mb/s (low power) condition, the BCC transmitter utilizes only 1.00mW.","[Vijayalakshmi, S.; Nagarajan, V.] Adhiparasakthi Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Melmaruvathur, Tamil Nadu, India","Vijayalakshmi, S (corresponding author), Adhiparasakthi Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Melmaruvathur, Tamil Nadu, India.",sankarviji7@gmail.com; nagarajanece31@gmail.com,"velmurugan, nagarajan/AAD-6724-2020","velmurugan, nagarajan/0000-0002-1031-0737; sankaran, vijayalakshmi/0000-0003-2146-5838",,,,22,1,1,1,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Stomach cancer is an increasing incidence of cancer both in the World as well as in Turkey. The most common method used worldwide for gastric cancer diagnosis is endoscopy. However, definitive diagnosis is made with endoscopic biopsy results. Diagnosis with endoscopy is a very specific and sensitive method. With high-resolution endoscopy it is possible to detect mild discolorations, bulges and structural changes of the surface of the mucosa. However, because the procedures are performed with the eye of a doctor, it is possible that the cancerous areas may be missed and / or incompletely detected. Because of the fact that the cancerous area cannot be completely detected may cause the problem of cancer recurrence after a certain period of surgical intervention. In order to overcome this problem, a computerized decision support system (CDS) has been implemented with the help of specialist physicians and image processing techniques. The performed CDS system works as an assistant to doctors of gastroenterology, helping to identify the cancerous area in the endoscopic images of the scaffold, to take biopsies from these areas and to make a better diagnosis. We believe that gastric cancer will be helpful in determining the area and biopsy samples taken from the patient will be useful in determining the area. It is therefore considered a useful model.","[Yasar, Ali] Selcuk Univ, Guneysinir Vocat Sch Higher Educ, Comp Programming, TR-42190 Guneysinir, Konya, Turkey; [Saritas, Ismail] Selcuk Univ, Fac Technol Elect & Elect Engn, TR-42031 Konya, Turkey; [Korkmaz, Huseyin] Selcuk Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol, TR-42031 Konya, Turkey","Yasar, A (corresponding author), Selcuk Univ, Guneysinir Vocat Sch Higher Educ, Comp Programming, TR-42190 Guneysinir, Konya, Turkey.",aliyasar@selcuk.edu.tr,"YASAR, ALI/B-2214-2017; Saritas, Ismail/F-3061-2011","YASAR, ALI/0000-0001-9012-7950; Saritas, Ismail/0000-0002-5743-4593",Selcuk University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Office (BAP) [15101020],This work was supported by the project number 15101020 by Selcuk University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Office (BAP).,,27,12,12,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Patient adoption and efficacy of such apps depends on inclusion of user-centred and evidence-based features. The objective of this study was to identify important design considerations from the perspectives of patients taking OAMs, caregivers and oncology pharmacists. The study employed a qualitative study design. Data were collected using in-depth interviews with patients (n=15), caregivers (n=3) and pharmacists (n=16). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and inductive thematic analysis approach was used in data analysis. Monitoring medication-related problems, medication information, replacement of or integration with current systems and accessibility of app content on devices other than smartphones were the key themes identified in the analysis. Flexible input methods for monitored data, glanceability of monitored reports/information, near real-time adherence enhancing and symptom management interventions and customisable reminder options were design considerations identified under the monitoring medication-related problems theme. Participants suggested the provision of focused and easily understandable medication information with a potential for personalisation. Integration of app-based adherence systems with patients' electronic medical records with added mechanisms for alerts in the dispensing system was also suggested as a key design requirement to improve quality of patient care and facilitate adoption by clinicians. Finally, smartphones were the most favoured platform with optional accessibility of app content on other devices. In conclusion, important design considerations were identified through a user-centred design approach. The findings will help developers and clinicians in the design of new app-based systems and evaluation of existing ones.","[Ali, Eskinder Eshetu; Chan, Sharlene Si Ling; Suganya, Thendral; Chew, Lita] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Pharm, Fac Sci, Block S4A,Level 3,18 Sci Dr 4, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Poh, Huan Yu; Susanto, Yosua Amadeus; Pang, Chee Khiang] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Fac Engn, Block E4,Level 5,4 Engn Dr 3, Singapore 117583, Singapore; [Leow, Jo Lene; Chew, Lita] Natl Canc Ctr Singapore, Dept Pharm, 11 Hosp Dr, Singapore 169610, Singapore; [Pang, Chee Khiang] Singapore Inst Technol, Engn Cluster, 10 Dover Dr, Singapore 138683, Singapore; [Yap, Kevin Yi-Lwern] La Trobe Univ, Sch Psychol & Publ Hlth, Dept Publ Hlth, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia","Yap, KYL (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Sch Psychol & Publ Hlth, Dept Publ Hlth, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia.",eskeshet@gmail.com; sharlenechan94@gmail.com; patrickpoh91@gmail.com; yosuasusanto@gmail.com; tthendralsuganya@gmail.com; jo.lene.leow@nccs.com.sg; justinpang@nus.edu.sg; lita.chew@nccs.com.sg; kevinyap.ehealth@gmail.com,"Yap, Kevin YL/B-8919-2008; Yap, Kevin/AAC-7396-2019; Ali, Eskinder Eshetu/K-9463-2016","Yap, Kevin YL/0000-0001-7322-4396; Yap, Kevin/0000-0001-7322-4396; Ali, Eskinder Eshetu/0000-0002-3581-6451",,,,62,4,4,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The approaches presented pair historical utilization rates for the clinical space with scheduled provider and patient volumes to support scheduling decisions in an operationally flexible clinic design. These historical data are augmented with clinic staff observation logs to identify target utilization rates as well as high congestion levels. Results are presented for two approaches: one where utilization of clinical space is a key performance metric and another where the decision-maker may be risk averse toward the use of provider time and use a probabilistic approach to determine provider staffing levels.,"[Berg, Bjorn; Longley, Grant; Dunitz, Jordan] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Berg, B (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",bberg@umn.edu,,"Berg, Bjorn/0000-0003-4610-4801",,,,24,9,9,2,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Our systematic review has been performed by searching full-text articles published from January 2008 to December 2018 in Embase, Medline, PubMed and Cochrane Library databases. Studies with adult patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke at any stage of evolution were included. We compared interventions with any type of transcranial direct current stimulation (anodal, cathodal or bihemispheric, also known as dual) regarding improvement of upper extremity motor function. We included 14 studies with 368 patients, of whom almost 89% have ischemic etiology and more than half are males. Most patients were considered subacute or chronic, while only two studies were selected with patients in the acute phase. Different methods of using transcranial direct current stimulation with several complementary therapies were identified, such as virtual reality, robot therapy, Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Constraint Induced Movement Therapy or Peripheral Nerve Stimulation. In conclusion, there is not significant evidence due to heterogeneity of clinical data and therapies.

The two-way communication allows uploading of infusion data and downloading of drug library updates. We have discovered significant delays in library updates. This research aimed at studying the drug library update process of one vendor pump and the contributing factors of pump update delays. Our data included BD Alaris pump status and infusion reports of two hospital systems (92 and 80days, respectively, in 2015). We analyzed drug library update progressions at the individual device and fleet levels. To complete a library update, a pump goes through two status transitions: from noncurrent to a new library pending, and from pending to current. On average it took five to nine days for 50% of a pump fleet to become current after a new drug library was disseminated. We confirmed factors that affect noncurrent-to-pending time to include time to first power-on and total power-on time. We also found that high pump utilization promotes shorter pending-to-current time. Two distinctive and important steps of a drug library update on Alaris pumps are pending a new library and completing the library installation. To avoid potential patient harm caused by infusion pumps without appropriate drug limits due to update delays, hospitals should monitor the progression of a drug library update on its pump fleet. Potential ways to improve drug library updates on a fleet of pumps include better technologies, improved pump user-interface design, and more staff training.","[Hsu, Kang-Yu; Yih, Yuehwern] Purdue Univ, Sch Ind Engn, Regenstrief Ctr Healthcare Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [DeLaurentis, Poching] Purdue Univ, Regenstrief Ctr Healthcare Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Bitan, Yuval] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Ind Engn & Management, IL-8410501 Beer Sheva, Israel","DeLaurentis, P (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Regenstrief Ctr Healthcare Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",poching@purdue.edu,"Bitan, Yuval/C-8587-2016","Bitan, Yuval/0000-0001-7053-7012; Yih, Yuehwern/0000-0003-2087-7718",Regenstrief Foundation,This study was partly funded by the Regenstrief Foundation.,,11,1,1,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The earlier diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer can increase the endurance rate of the affected people. But, the structure of the cancer cell makes the diagnosis process more challenging, in which the most of the cells are superimposed. By adopting the efficient image processing techniques, the diagnosis process can be made effective, earlier and accurate, where the time aspect is extremely decisive. With those considerations, the main objective of this work is to propose a region based Fuzzy C-Means Clustering (FCM) technique for segmenting the lung cancer region and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classification for diagnosing the cancer stage, which helps in clinical practice in significant way to increase the morality rate. Moreover, the proposed ECM-CSD (Efficient Classification Model for Cancer Stage Diagnosis) uses Computed Tomography (CT) lung images for processing, since it poses higher imaging sensitivity, resolution with good isotopic acquisition in lung nodule identification. With those images, the pre-processing has been made with Gaussian Filter for smoothing and Gabor Filter for enhancement. Following, based on the extracted image features, the effective segmentation of lung nodules is performed using the FCM based clustering. And, the stages of cancer are identified based on the SVM classification technique. Further, the model is analyzed with MATLAB tool by incorporating the LIDC-IDRI lung CT images clinical dataset. The comparative experiments show the efficiency of the proposed model in terms of the performance evaluation factors like increased accuracy and reduced error rate.","[Kavitha, M.

This manuscript focuses on a data transformation mechanism that can take full advantage of a data intensive environment without losing the realistic complexity of health, confronting the challenges of heterogeneous data. The developed mechanism involves running ontology alignment and transformation operations in healthcare datasets, stored into a triple-based data store, and restructuring it according to specified criteria, discovering the correspondence and possible transformations between the ingested data and specific Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) through semantic and ontology alignment techniques. The evaluation of this mechanism results into the fact that it should be used in scenarios where real-time healthcare data streams emerge, and thus their exploitation is critical in real-time, since it performs better and more efficient in comparison with a different data transformation mechanism.","[Kiourtis, Athanasios; Mavrogiorgou, Argyro; Maglogiannis, Ilias; Kyriazis, Dimosthenis] Univ Piraeus, Dept Digital Syst, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou Str, Piraeus 18534, Greece; [Menychtas, Andreas] BioAssist, 1 Mpakou Str, Athens 11524, Greece","Kiourtis, A (corresponding author), Univ Piraeus, Dept Digital Syst, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou Str, Piraeus 18534, Greece.",kiourtis@unipi.gr; margy@unipi.gr; amenychtas@gmail.com; imaglo@unipi.gr; dimos@unipi.gr,"Maglogiannis, Ilias/X-5484-2018; Kyriazis, Dimosthenis/AAM-9407-2021","Maglogiannis, Ilias/0000-0003-2860-399X; Kyriazis, Dimosthenis/0000-0001-7019-7214","Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI); General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT), under the HFRI PhD Fellowship [1792, 2468]","The research work was supported by the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI) and the General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT), under the HFRI PhD Fellowship grants (1792, and 2468).",,15,15,15,3,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In this paper, our goal was to determine whether the DW-MRI can be used for qualitative and quantitative liver cancer analysis, where an automated method will be proposed for improving the accuracy of liver segmentation in DW-MRI to increase the ability of diagnosis of disease. We firstly analyzed the research status of liver cancer diagnosis, especially on the issues of liver image segmentation technology in MRI. Then, the imaging mechanism and image features of the DW-MRI were analyzed, and the initial DW-MRI slice was segmented by graph-cut algorithm. Finally, our obtained result from the liver DW-MRI image is quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. Experimental results show that DW-MRI has a great advantage in the diagnosis, the DWI images of benign lesion group was lower than that of malignant lesion, thus DW-MRI is segmented by graph-cut algorithm can provide important additional information regarding differential diagnosis of specific liver cancer to some extend.","[Li, Jiapeng; Yang, Yue] Tongde Hosp Zhejiang Prov, Hangzhou 310012, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Yang, Y (corresponding author), Tongde Hosp Zhejiang Prov, Hangzhou 310012, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",11493518@qq.com,,,,,,23,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Although many studies have described the benefits of such applications, the best time to introduce 3D technology into surgical training has not been determined. Therefore, we conducted a randomized study to determine a suitable period for the introduction of this technology. Seventy-one surgical residents were randomized into 2 groups (two-dimensional computed tomography (CT) group and 3D image group), and they completed a test on anatomy and imaging as well as a questionnaire. Post-graduate year 1 (PGY1) residents in the 3D group performed significantly better than those in the CT group, although the third-year residents did not present significant differences in either the score or the time spent answering the questions. Although residents in different years of training held different attitudes toward the difficulty of anatomy and imaging learning, they all showed a high level of acceptance of the 3D training. This study revealed that 3D images improved the junior residents' performance in imaging reasoning. Thus, systematically introducing 3D images early in a surgical resident training program may help produce a better anatomy-imaging-surgery system.","[Lin, Chen; Lin, Guole; Yu, Jianchun; Liao, Quan; Zhao, Yupei] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Peking Union Med Coll Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lin, Chen; Gao, Junyi; Zheng, Hua; Zhao, Jun; Yang, Hua; Zheng, Yue; Cao, Yihan; Chen, Yufei; Wu, Guoliang; Lin, Guole; Yu, Jianchun; Li, Hanzhong; Pan, Hui; Liao, Quan; Zhao, Yupei] PUMC, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China; [Lin, Chen; Pan, Hui] PUMCH, Natl Virtual Simulat Lab Educ Ctr Med Sci, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China; [Gao, Junyi; Zheng, Hua; Zheng, Yue; Cao, Yihan; Chen, Yufei; Wu, Guoliang] CAMS, PUMCH, Eight Year Program Clin Med, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jun; Pan, Hui] CAMS, PUMCH, Dept Educ, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China; [Yang, Hua] CAMS, PUMCH, Dept Head & Neck Surg, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China; [Li, Hanzhong] CAMS, Dept Urol Surg, PUMCH, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China","Liao, Q; Zhao, YP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Med Sci, Peking Union Med Coll Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Liao, Q; Zhao, YP (corresponding author), PUMC, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China.",lqpumc@126.com; zhao8028@263.net,"Cao, Yihan/AAV-3598-2020","Cao, Yihan/0000-0001-9486-3365",funds for Peking Union Medical College Postgraduate Education Reform Program [10023201600101]; funds for Peking Union Medical College Education Reform Program [2015zlgc0126],"The authors appreciate the support from all the surgical residents from PUMCH.

Eighty-seven lung cancer subjects were enrolled in the study, including pathologically proved 47 ADC patients and 40 SCC patients, and 261 texture features were extracted from the manually delineated region of interests on CECT and NECT images respectively. Fisher score was then used to select the effective discriminative texture features between groups, and the selected texture features were adopted to differentiate ADC from SCC using Support Vector Machine and Leave-one-out cross-validation. Both NECT and CECT images could achieve the same best classification accuracy of 95.4%, and most of the informative features were from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix. In addition, CECT images were found with enhanced texture features compared with NECT images, and combining texture features of CECT and NECT images together could further improve the prediction accuracy. Besides the texture feature, the tumor location information also contributed to the differential diagnosis between ADC and SCC.","[Liu, Han; Jing, Bin; Long, Zhuqing; Mo, Xiao; Li, Haiyun] Capital Med Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Beijing 100069, Peoples R China; [Han, Wenjuan] Gen Hosp Chinese Peoples Armed Police Forces, Dept Radiol, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China","Li, HY (corresponding author), Capital Med Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Beijing 100069, Peoples R China.",haiyunli@ccmu.edu.cn,"Jing, Bin/AFN-5046-2022",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [81220108007]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [7174282],"This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 81220108007), Beijing Natural Science Foundation (No. 4122018).

Although IAQ is not usually monitored, it must be perceived as a relevant issue to follow up for the inhabitants' well-being and comfort for enhanced living environments and occupational health. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has a substantial influence on public health and can be used as an essential index of IAQ. CO2 levels over 1000ppm, indicates an indoor air potential problem. Monitoring CO2 concentration in real-time is essential to detect IAQ issues to quickly intervene in the building. The continuous technological advances in several areas such as Ambient Assisted Living and the Internet of Things (IoT) make it possible to build smart objects with significant capabilities for sensing and connecting. This paper presents the iAirCO(2) system, a solution for CO2 real-time monitoring based on IoT architecture. The iAirCO(2) is composed of a hardware prototype for ambient data collection and a Web and smartphone software for data consulting. In future, it is planned that these data can be accessed by doctors in order to support medical diagnostics. Compared to other solutions, the iAirCO(2) is based on open-source technologies, providing a total Wi-Fi system, with several advantages such as its modularity, scalability, low-cost, and easy installation. The results reveal that the system can generate a viable IAQ appraisal, allowing to anticipate technical interventions that contribute to a healthier living environment.","[Marques, Goncalo; Pitarma, Rui] Polytech Inst Guarda, Unit Inland Dev, Ave Dr Francisco Sa Carneiro 50, P-6300559 Guarda, Portugal; [Ferreira, Cristina Roque] Hosp Ctr & Univ Coimbra CHUC, Dept Imagiol, P-3000075 Coimbra, Portugal","Marques, G (corresponding author), Polytech Inst Guarda, Unit Inland Dev, Ave Dr Francisco Sa Carneiro 50, P-6300559 Guarda, Portugal.",goncalosantosmarques@gmail.com; cris.rcf@gmail.com; rpitarma@ipg.pt,"Marques, Goncalo/N-1805-2018","Marques, Goncalo/0000-0001-5834-6571; Ferreira, Cristina/0000-0003-4476-4646; Pitarma, Rui Antonio/0000-0001-9486-0631",,,,35,37,38,9,45,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

However, the automatic extraction of information within these notes is challenging due to their narrative style. In this context, our goal was to identify clusters of patients based on fourteen comorbidities related to obesity, automatically extracted with the cTAKES tool from the i2b2 Obesity Challenge data. Furthermore, results were compared with clusters obtained from experts' annotated data. The sparse K-means algorithms were used in both experiment at two levels: at the first level, three clusters were found, and at the second, new clusters were found by applying the same algorithm to each of the clusters from the former level. The results show that three types of clusters could be identified based on the number of comorbidities and the percentage of patients suffering from them. Diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and depression were the diseases with the highest weights contributing to the cluster distribution.","[Reategui, Ruth; Ratte, Sylvie] Ecole Technol Super, 1100 Notre Dame St West, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Reategui, Ruth; Bautista-Valarezo, Estefania; Duque, Victor] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, San Cayetano Alto 1101608, Loja, Ecuador","Duque, V (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Particular Loja, San Cayetano Alto 1101608, Loja, Ecuador.",rmreategui@utpl.edu.ec; Sylvie.Ratte@etsmtls.ca; mebautista@utpl.edu.ec; victorduquetf@gmail.com,"RattÃ©, Sylvie/ABU-0444-2022; Bautista, Estefanía/ABC-7656-2021","Bautista, Estefanía/0000-0002-6012-3403; Reategui, Ruth/0000-0002-7304-4413; Exposito Duque, Victor/0000-0002-2199-2454",,,,35,4,4,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

We hypothesized that VL reduces anesthesia control time (ACT), a metric of anesthesia efficiency, compared with fiberoptic intubation (FOI) in potentially difficult airways, but that direct laryngoscopy (DL) remains more efficient in routine cases. We performed a multi-institutional, retrospective chart review of anesthetic cases from 2015 to 2016. Cases were compared based on choice of airway technique (laryngeal mask airway [LMA], DL, VL or FOI) and ACT. Generalized linear models with gamma distribution and log link were then used to model the data to control for variables including ASA physical status (PS), Mallampati (MP) score, body mass index, and presence of a trainee. ACT was analyzed for 32,542 cases. LMA insertion was associated with a median ACT of 10min (CI 8-14min), DL 14min (CI 11-18min), VL 17min (CI 13-21min) and FOI 20min (CI 14.5-26min). Modeling confirmed these results when controlling for variables expected to increase the ACT. However, modeling also revealed that presence of a trainee minimizes the increase in ACT for cases using VL or FOI. Use of VL in patients with a high MP score may improve anesthesia efficiency in the operating room. ASA PS, MP score, and presence of a trainee are all associated with an increased ACT. Trainee presence with both FOI and VL was associated with reduced increases in ACT for these devices.","[Rowland, Matthew J.; Urman, Richard D.; Preiss, David A.; Vacanti, Joshua C.] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Xu, Xinling] Harvard Med Sch, Beth Israel Deaconess Hosp, Dept Anesthesia, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ehrenfeld, Jesse M.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA","Urman, RD (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",rurman@bwh.harvard.edu,"Urman, Richard/ABG-4830-2020; Urman, Richard/AAH-7758-2019; Ehrenfeld, Jesse/AAI-2951-2020","Urman, Richard/0000-0002-0516-5977; ",,,,24,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

It helps physicians analyze the severity of injury by taking into account the following fracture features, such as location of the fracture, number of pieces and deviation from the original location. Besides, it helps provide accurate 3D visualization and decide optimal recovery plans/processes. To accurately segment fracture bones from CT images, in the paper, we introduce a segmentation technique that makes labeling process easier. Based on the patient-specific anatomy, unique labels are assigned. Unlike conventional techniques, it also includes the removal of unwanted artifacts, such as flesh. In our experiments, we have demonstrated our concept with real-world data (with an accuracy of 95.45%) and have compared with state-of-the-art techniques. For validation, our tests followed expert-based decisions i.e., clinical ground-truth.

During HRV recording, a new RMSSD value is calculated each time a new RR is captured. The recording process stops once an acceptable stability of HRV is reached. This new method was tested on 3 groups of 15 subjects (cardiac patients, sedentary employees and national-level athletes) and compared with the gold standard method (5min HRV recording time). The RMSSD indices provided by the short method and by the gold standard method (respectively 62.1 +/- 43.7ms vs. 62.7 +/- 44.1ms) showed no significant differences. In addition, a very strong correlation was observed between RMSSD values obtained by the 2 methods (n=45; R=0.998; p<0.001). Routine duration of the new method was significantly shorter with a time-savings of 2min (178 +/- 51s vs. 300s; p<0.05). This new algorithm seems to adapt perfectly to each subject, and it can detect the stability phase for HRV measurements during the recording process. Algorithm provides an adapted and personal routine duration that can evolve each day depending on parameters such as fatigue or stress level that are known to influence HRV. This solution can be easily implemented in a smartphone application and seems particularly suitable for performing daily HRV monitoring in field conditions.","[Saboul, Damien] Be Studys, Route Meyrin 123, CH-1219 Geneva, Switzerland; [Saboul, Damien; Hautier, Christophe] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, Interuniv Lab Human Movement Sci LIBM, EA 7424, Lyon, France","Saboul, D (corresponding author), Be Studys, Route Meyrin 123, CH-1219 Geneva, Switzerland.;Saboul, D (corresponding author), Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, Interuniv Lab Human Movement Sci LIBM, EA 7424, Lyon, France.",dsaboul@free.fr,,"Saboul, Damien/0000-0003-1891-9077",,,,28,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The system permits the evaluation of the volumes of grey matter in subjects such as the AD or the conditions related to it and are compared in an automated manner with the healthy controls in the entire brain. The article also reviews the findings of the VBM that are related to various stages of the AD and also its prodrome known as the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). For this work, the Ada Boost classifier has been proposed to be a good selector of feature that brings down the classification error's upper bound. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) had been employed for the dimensionality reduction and for improving efficiency. The PCA is a powerful, as well as a reliable, tool in data analysis. Calculating fitness scores will be an independent process. For this reason, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) along with a greedy search may be computed easily along with some high-performance systems of computing. The primary goal of this work was to identify better collections or permutations of the classifiers that are weak to build stronger ones. The results of the experiment prove that the GAs is one more alternative technique used for boosting the permutation of weak classifiers identified in Ada Boost which can produce some better solutions compared to the classical Ada Boost.","[Saravanakumar, S.] Anna Univ, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Thangaraj, P.] Bannari Amman Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Sathyamangalam, Erode, India","Saravanakumar, S (corresponding author), Anna Univ, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.",sar112113118@gmail.com,"kumar, saravana s/B-5229-2018",,,,,15,6,6,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

IoT has also been recognised for its revolution in reshaping modern healthcare with aspiring wide range prospects, including economical, technological and social. This study aims to establish IoT-based smart home security solutions for real-time health monitoring technologies in telemedicine architecture. A multilayer taxonomy is driven and conducted in this study. In the first layer, a comprehensive analysis on telemedicine, which focuses on the client and server sides, shows that other studies associated with IoT-based smart home applications have several limitations that remain unaddressed. Particularly, remote patient monitoring in healthcare applications presents various facilities and benefits by adopting IoT-based smart home technologies without compromising the security requirements and potentially large number of risks. An extensive search is conducted to identify articles that handle these issues, related applications are comprehensively reviewed and a coherent taxonomy for these articles is established. A total number of (n=3064) are gathered between 2007 and 2017 for most reliable databases, such as ScienceDirect, Web of Science and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineer Xplore databases. Then, the articles based on IoT studies that are associated with telemedicine applications are filtered. Nine articles are selected and classified into two categories. The first category, which accounts for 22.22% (n=2/9), includes surveys on telemedicine articles and their applications. The second category, which accounts for 77.78% (n=7/9), includes articles on the client and server sides of telemedicine architecture. The collected studies reveal the essential requirement in constructing another taxonomy layer and review IoT-based smart home security studies. Therefore, IoT-based smart home security features are introduced and analysed in the second layer. The security of smart home design based on IoT applications is an aspect that represents a crucial matter for general occupants of smart homes, in which studies are required to provide a better solution with patient security, privacy protection and security of users' entities from being stolen or compromised. Innovative technologies have dispersed limitations related to this matter. The existing gaps and trends in this area should be investigated to provide valuable visions for technical environments and researchers. Thus, 67 articles are obtained in the second layer of our taxonomy and are classified into six categories. In the first category, 25.37% (n=17/67) of the articles focus on architecture design. In the second category, 17.91% (n=12/67) includes security analysis articles that investigate the research status in the security area of IoT-based smart home applications. In the third category, 10.44% (n=7/67) includes articles about security schemes. In the fourth category, 17.91% (n=12/67) comprises security examination. In the fifth category, 13.43% (n=9/67) analyses security protocols. In the final category, 14.92% (n=10/67) analyses the security framework. Then, the identified basic characteristics of this emerging field are presented and provided in the following aspects. Open challenges experienced on the development of IoT-based smart home security are addressed to be adopted fully in telemedicine applications. Then, the requirements are provided to increase researcher's interest in this study area. On this basis, a number of recommendations for different parties are described to provide insights on the next steps that should be considered to enhance the security of smart homes based on IoT. A map matching for both taxonomies is developed in this study to determine the novel risks and benefits of IoT-based smart home security for real-time remote health monitoring within client and server sides in telemedicine applications.","[Talal, Mohammed] Univ Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia UTHM, Dept Commun Engn, Fac Elect & Elect Engn, Parit Raja, Malaysia; [Zaidan, A.

A proprietary machine learning algorithm was applied utilizing operating room factors such as patient demographic data, pre-surgical milestones, and hospital logistics and compared to that of a conventional EHR. Actual case duration and pCD (Leap Rail vs EHR) was obtained at one institution over the span of 3months. Actual case duration was defined as time between patient entry into an OR and time of exit. pCD was defined as case time allotted by either Leap Rail or EHR. Cases where Leap Rail was unable to generate a pCD were excluded. A total of 1059 surgical cases were performed during the study period, with 990 cases being eligible for the study. Over all sub-specialties, Leap Rail showed a 7min improvement in absolute difference between pCD and actual case duration when compared to conventional EHR (p<0.0001). In aggregate, the Leap Rail method resulted in a 70% reduction in overall scheduling inaccuracy. Machine-learning algorithms are a promising method of increasing pCD accuracy and represent one means of improving OR planning and efficiency.","[Tuwatananurak, Justin P.; Xu, Xinling; Vacanti, Joshua A.; Urman, Richard D.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zadeh, Shayan] Leap Rail Inc, Houston, TX USA; [Fulton, William R.] NorthBay Healthcare, Fairfield, CA USA; [Ehrenfeld, Jesse M.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Nashville, TN 37212 USA; [Urman, Richard D.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Perioperat Res, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Urman, RD (corresponding author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Urman, RD (corresponding author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Perioperat Res, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",rurman@bwh.harvard.edu,"Urman, Richard/AAH-7758-2019; Urman, Richard/ABG-4830-2020; Ehrenfeld, Jesse/AAI-2951-2020; Fulton, William/AFM-0385-2022","Urman, Richard/0000-0002-0516-5977; Fulton, William/0000-0002-3074-9958",,,,19,15,15,2,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The study was retrospective for 106 biopsied PNLs from 100 patients. Seventy-five scans were Contrast-Enhanced (CECT) and 25 received no enhancer (NECT). Axial reconstructions in soft-tissue and lung kernel were applied at three different slice thicknesses, 0.75mm (CECT/NECT n=25/6), 1.5mm (n=18/9) and 3.0mm (n=43/18). We questioned the effect of (1) enhancer, (2) kernel and (3) slice thickness on the CAD performance. Our main findings are: (1) Vessel suppression is effective and specific in both NECT and CECT. (2) Contrast enhancement significantly increased the CAD sensitivity from 60% in NECT to 80% in CECT, P=0.025 Fischer's exact test. (3) The CAD sensitivity was 84% in 3mm slices compared to 68% in 0.75mm slices, P>0.2 Fischer's exact test. (4) Small lesions of low attenuation were detected with higher sensitivity. (5) Lung kernel reconstructions increased the false positive rate without affecting the sensitivity (P>0.05 McNemar's test). In conclusion, ClearReadCT showed an optimized sensitivity of 84% and a positive predictive value of 67% in enhanced lung scans with thick, soft kernel reconstructions. NECT, thin slices and lung kernel reconstruction were associated with inferior performance.","[Wagner, Anne-Kathrin; Teichgraeber, Ulf; Papageorgiou, Ismini] Univ Hosp Jena, Inst Diagnost & Intervent Radiol, Klinikum 1, D-07747 Jena, Germany; [Wagner, Anne-Kathrin; Malich, Ansgar; Papageorgiou, Ismini] Sudharz Hosp Nordhausen, Inst Radiol, Dr Robert Koch St 39, D-99734 Nordhausen, Germany; [Hapich, Arno] Sudharz Hosp Nordhausen, Dept Thorac Surg, Dr Robert Koch St 39, D-99734 Nordhausen, Germany; [Psychogios, Marios Nikos] Univ Med Gottingen, Inst Diagnost & Intervent Neuroradiol, Robert Koch St 40, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany","Papageorgiou, I (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Jena, Inst Diagnost & Intervent Radiol, Klinikum 1, D-07747 Jena, Germany.;Papageorgiou, I (corresponding author), Sudharz Hosp Nordhausen, Inst Radiol, Dr Robert Koch St 39, D-99734 Nordhausen, Germany.",ismini.e.papageorgiou@gmail.com,"Papageorgiou, Ismini/AAI-7329-2020; Teichgräber, med.

The ontology deconstructs the construct into its constituent dimensions and elements, and assembles them into a complete, parsimonious description of the same. We then map the corpus of literature on PSS for health behavior change through physical activity onto the ontology. The resulting ontological map highlights the research topics that are highly- and lightly-emphasized, as well as those with little or no emphasis.

This research offers a novel approach for estimating the smart medical devices (SMDs) selection process in a group decision making (GDM) in a vague decision environment. The complexity of the selected decision criteria for the smart medical devices is a significant feature of this analysis. To simulate these processes, a methodology that combines neutrosophics using bipolar numbers with Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) under GDM is suggested. Neutrosophics with TOPSIS approach is applied in the decision making process to deal with the vagueness, incomplete data and the uncertainty, considering the decisions criteria in the data collected by the decision makers (DMs). In this research, the stress is placed upon the choosing of sugar analyzing smart medical devices for diabetics' patients. The main objective is to present the complications of the problem, raising interest among specialists in the healthcare industry and assessing smart medical devices under different evaluation criteria. The problem is formulated as a multi criteria decision type with seven alternatives and seven criteria, and then edited as a multi criteria decision model with seven alternatives and seven criteria. The results of the neutrosophics with TOPSIS model are analyzed, showing that the competence of the acquired results and the rankings are sufficiently stable. The results of the suggested method are also compared with the neutrosophic extensions AHP and MOORA models in order to validate and prove the acquired results. In addition, we used the SPSS program to check the stability of the variations in the rankings by the Spearman coefficient of correlation. The selection methodology is applied on a numerical case, to prove the validity of the suggested approach.","[Abdel-Basset, Mohamed; Gamal, Abduallah] Zagazig Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Dept Operat Res, Sharqiyah, Egypt; [Manogaran, Gunasekaran] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Smarandache, Florentin] Univ New Mexico, Math & Sci Dept, Gallup, NM 87301 USA","Abdel-Basset, M (corresponding author), Zagazig Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Dept Operat Res, Sharqiyah, Egypt.",analyst_mohamed@zu.edu.eg; gmanogaran@ucdavis.edu; abduallahgamal@gmail.com; smarand@unm.edu,"Smarandache, Florentin/K-3160-2013; Gamal, Abduallah/ABI-5916-2020; Abdel-Basset, Mohamed/AAH-2833-2019","Smarandache, Florentin/0000-0002-5560-5926; Gamal, Abduallah/0000-0002-3819-0714; Abdel-Basset, Mohamed/0000-0003-1102-1387; Abdel-Basset, Mohamed/0000-0002-2794-3936",,,,33,112,112,0,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Secondary goals are to 1) analyze the adoption rate of PeerVue and 2) assess the accuracy of the classification of actionable findings within this system. Over a two-year period, 890,204 radiology reports were analyzed retrospectively in order to identify the number of actionable findings communicated before (Year 1) and after the implementation of PeerVue (Year 2) at a tertiary care academic medical center. A sub-sample of 145 actionable findings over a two-month period in Year 2 was further analyzed to assess the degree of concordance with our reporting policy. Before PeerVue, 4623/423,070 (1.09%) of radiology reports contained an actionable finding. After its implementation, this number increased to 6825/467,134 (1.46%) (p<0.0001). PeerVue was used in 3886/6825 (56.9%) cases with actionable findings. The remaining 2939/6825 (43.1%) were reported using the legacy tagging system.

Wireless body area networks (WBANs) provide a simple and low-cost strategy for health monitoring and telemedicine of the elderly. Many authentication schemes based on WBAN have been presented to address the sensitivity and privacy of collected data and the open characteristic of wireless networks. Wu et al. recently presented an efficient anonymous authentication scheme for WBANs, in which a one-side bilinear pairing methodology was applied to reduce the burden on the WBAN client side. However, we demonstrate that their scheme suffers from client impersonation attacks and that the adversary can easily forge a legal client to access the network service. In this paper, we analyze the limitations of Wu et al.'s scheme and design a novel mutual authentication scheme for WBANs that adopt asymmetric bilinear pairing to enhance security. Results of security and performance analyses reveal that the new scheme offers more effective security, better performance, and higher efficiency than Wu et al.'s scheme. We also provide a formal security proof of the protocol by using BAN authentication logic.","[Chen, Rui] Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Rui; Peng, Dezhong] Sichuan Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Peng, Dezhong] Chengdu Ruibei Yingte Informat Technol Ltd Co, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Peng, DZ (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Peng, DZ (corresponding author), Chengdu Ruibei Yingte Informat Technol Ltd Co, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",crs1934@hotmail.com; pengdz@scu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1435213, 61172180]; Chengdu International Cooperation Project [2016-GH02-00048-HZ, 2015-GH02-00041-HZ]; General Project of Education Department in Sichuan [18ZB0485]","This study was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number U1435213 and 61172180), and Chengdu International Cooperation Project (grant number 2016-GH02-00048-HZ and 2015-GH02-00041-HZ), and General Project of Education Department in Sichuan (grant number 18ZB0485).",,29,10,10,1,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The real medical diagnostic data test shows that this algorithm improves the accuracy rate of classification learning algorithm compared with the existing sampling algorithms, especially for the accuracy rate and recall rate of minority classes.","[Han, Weihong; Li, Shudong] Guangzhou Univ, Inst Adv Technol Cyberspace, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Han, Weihong] UESTC Guangdong, Inst Elect & Informat Engn, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zizhong; Jia, Yan] Natl Univ Def Technol, Sch Comp, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China","Han, WH (corresponding author), Guangzhou Univ, Inst Adv Technol Cyberspace, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Han, WH (corresponding author), UESTC Guangdong, Inst Elect & Informat Engn, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",hanweihong@gzhu.edu.cn,,,NSFC [61672020]; national key research and development program [2016YFB0800303]; DongGuan Innovative Research Team,"Funded by NSFC (No. 61672020), the national key research and development program [2016YFB0800303], Supported by DongGuan Innovative Research Team",,15,20,21,2,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Phonetic properties are processed in both linguistic and motor stages of word production. Four phonetically dissimilar phonemic structures BA, FO, LE, and RY were chosen as covert speech tasks. Ten neurologically healthy volunteers with the age range of 21-33 participated in this experiment. Participants were asked to covertly speak a phonemic structure when they heard an auditory cue. EEG was recorded with 64 electrodes at 2048 samples/s. Initially, one-second trials were used, which contained linguistic and motor imagery activities. The four-class true positive rate was calculated. In the next stage, 312ms trials were used to exclude covert articulation from analysis. By eliminating the covert articulation stage, the four-class grand average classification accuracy dropped from 96.4% to 94.5%. The most valuable features emerge after Auditory cue recognition (100ms post onset), and within the 70-128Hz frequency range. The most significant identified brain regions were the Prefrontal Cortex (linked to stimulus driven executive control), Wernicke's area (linked to Phonological code retrieval), the right IFG, and Broca's area (linked to syllabification). Alpha and Beta band oscillations associated with motor imagery do not contain enough information to fully reflect the complexity of speech movements. Over 90% of the most class-dependent features were in the 30-128Hz range, even during the covert articulation stage. As a result, compared to linguistic functions, the contribution of motor imagery of articulation in class separability of covert speech tasks from EEG data is negligible.","[Jahangiri, Amir; Sepulveda, Francisco] Univ Essex, Sch Comp Sci & Elect Engn, BCI NE Lab, Colchester, Essex, England","Jahangiri, A (corresponding author), Univ Essex, Sch Comp Sci & Elect Engn, BCI NE Lab, Colchester, Essex, England.",ajahan@essex.ac.uk; fsepulv@essex.ac.uk,,,,,,66,11,11,3,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In medical image analysis, the automatic segmentation of tumors from brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is the most critical issue. Existing research has some limitations, such as high processing time and lower accuracy, because of the time required for the training process. In this research, a new automatic segmentation process is introduced using machine learning and a swarm intelligence scheme. Here, a fuzzy logic with spiking neuron model (FL-SNM) is proposed for segmenting the brain tumor region in MR images. Initially, input images are preprocessed to remove Gaussian and Poisson noise using a modified Kuan filter (MKF). In the MKF, the optimal selection of the minimum MSE of image pixels is achieved using a random search algorithm (RSA), which improves the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Then, the image is smoothed using an anisotropic diffusion filter (ADF) to reduce the over-filtering problem. Afterwards, to extract statistical texture features, Fisher's linear-discriminant analysis (FLDA) is used. Finally, extracted features are transferred to the FL-SNM process and this scheme effectively segments the tumor region. In FL-SNM, the consequent parameters such as weight and bias play an important role in segmenting the region. Therefore, optimizing the weight parameter values using a chicken behavior-based swarm intelligence (CSI) algorithm, is proposed. The proposed (FL-SNM) scheme attained better performance in terms of high accuracy (94.87%), sensitivity (92.07%), specificity (99.34%), precision rate (89.36%), recall rate (88.39%), F-measure (95.06%), G-mean (95.63%), and DSC rate (91.2%), compared to existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and hierarchical self-organizing maps (HSOMs).","[Natarajan, Aparna] SRS Coll Engn & Technol, Dept EEE, Salem, India; [Kumarasamy, Sathiyasekar] SA Engn Coll, Dept EEE, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India","Natarajan, A (corresponding author), SRS Coll Engn & Technol, Dept EEE, Salem, India.",aparnan2101@gmail.com; ksathiyasekar@gmail.com,"Sathiyasekar, Kumarasamy/AAB-7284-2019",,,,,36,9,9,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

This study aims to improve sensor-based defence and attack mechanisms to ensure patient privacy in client side when using mHealth. Thus, a multilayer taxonomy was conducted to attain the goal of this study. Within the first layer, real-time remote monitoring studies based on sensor technology for telemedicine application were reviewed and analysed to examine these technologies and provide researchers with a clear vision of security- and privacy-based sensors in the telemedicine area. An extensive search was conducted to find articles about security and privacy issues, review related applications comprehensively and establish the coherent taxonomy of these articles. ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore and Web of Science databases were investigated for articles on mHealth in telemedicine-based sensor. A total of 3064 papers were collected from 2007to 2017. The retrieved articles were filtered according to the security and privacy of sensor-based telemedicine applications. A total of 19 articles were selected and classified into two categories. The first category, 57.89% (n=11/19), included survey on telemedicine articles and their applications. The second category, 42.1% (n=8/19), included articles contributed to the three-tiered architecture of telemedicine. The collected studies improved the essential need to add another taxonomy layer and review the sensor-based smartphone authentication studies. This map matching for both taxonomies was developed for this study to investigate sensor field comprehensively and gain access to novel risks and benefits of the mHealth security in telemedicine application. The literature on sensor-based smartphones in the second layer of our taxonomy was analysed and reviewed. A total of 599 papers were collected from 2007to 2017. In this layer, we obtained a final set of 81 articles classified into three categories. The first category of the articles [86.41% (n=70/81)], where sensor-based smartphones were examined by utilising orientation sensors for user authentication, was used. The second category [7.40% (n=6/81)] included attack articles, which were not intensively included in our literature analysis. The third category [8.64% (n=7/81)] included other' articles. Factors were considered to understand fully the various contextual aspects of the field in published studies. The characteristics included the motivation and challenges related to sensor-based authentication of smartphones encountered by researchers and the recommendations to strengthen this critical area of research. Finally, many studies on the sensor-based smartphone in the second layer have focused on enhancing accurate authentication because sensor-based smartphones require sensors that could authentically secure mHealth.","[Shuwandy, Moceheb Lazam; Zaidan, B.

High or low blood pressure or its rapid fluctuations can be associated to various diseases or conditions. Nowadays, high blood pressure is considered to be an important health risk factor and major cause of various health problems worldwide. High blood pressure may precede serious heart diseases, stroke and kidney failure. Accurate blood pressure measurement and monitoring plays fundamental role in diagnosis, prevention and treatment of these diseases. Blood pressure is usually measured in the hospitals, as a part of a standard medical routine. However, there is an increasing demand for methodologies, systems as well as accurate and unobtrusive devices that will permit continuous blood pressure measurement and monitoring for a wide variety of patients, allowing them to perform their daily activities without any disturbance. Technological advancements in the last decade have created opportunities for using various devices as a part of ambient assisted living for improving quality of life for people in their natural environment.

At present, Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) screening method is utilized to identify colon cancer tumor at early stage to save the patient life who affected by the colon cancer. In this CTC method, the radiologist needs to analyze the colon polyps in digital image using computer aided approach with accurate automatic tumor classification to detect the cancer tumor at early stage. This kind of computer aided approach can operate as an intermediate between input digital image and radiologist. Therefore, in this paper, a novel computer aided approach is presented with ROI based color histogram and SVM2 to find the cancer tumor in WCE image. In this method, the digital WCE image can be preprocessed using filtering and ROI based color histogram depending on the salient region in colon. In common, the salient region can be distinctive because of low redundancy. Hence, the saliency is estimated by ROI based color histogram on the basis of color and structure contrast in given colon image for the further process of clustering and tumor classification in WCE image. The K-means clustering can be employed to cluster the preprocessed digital image to discover the tumor of colon. Subsequently, the features are extracted from the image in terms of contrast, correlation, energy and homogeneity by applying SGLDM method. The SVM2 classifier as input to classify the tumor is normal or malignancy using selected feature vectors. Here, the extracted features can also being combined to enhance the hybrid feature vector for the accurate tumor classification. Experimental results of proposed method can show that this presented technique can executes can tumor detection in colon image accurately reaching almost 95% in evaluation with existing algorithms.","[Sundaram, P.

The integrity and availability of medical data are the basic guarantee for the smooth operation of these activities. The privacy of medical data is a natural demand from the sensitivity of medical data. At present, there are mainly two ways to protect the privacy of medical data. One way is to store medical data in a local database and set up an access control strategy of the database. The other way is to encrypt medical data with the patient's key and to share the key when needed. The problem with the first method is that the data in the local database may be modified or deleted. The problem with the second method is that the key cannot be shared when the patient dies during the diagnosis and treatment. These two problems will damage the availability of data. This paper proposes to establish a shared key that could be reconstructed by the legitimate parties before the process of diagnosis and treatment begins. The data in the diagnosis and treatment process is encrypted and stored in a blockchain using the shared key. The proposal meets the integrity, availability and privacy requirements of medical data. It uses the sibling intractable function families (SIFF) to establish a shared key, and uses the Hyperledger Fabric to store encrypted data. The simulation shows that the system has good efficiency. Additionally, it is the first time to introduce SIFF to a blockchain application.","[Tian, Haibo; He, Jiejie] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangdong Key Lab Informat Secur, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ding, Yong] Guilin Univ Elect Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Informat Secur, Guangxi Key Lab Cryptog & Informat Secur, Guilin 541004, Guangxi, Peoples R China","Tian, HB (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangdong Key Lab Informat Secur, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",tianhb@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0802500]; Guangxi Key Laboratory of Cryptography and Information Security; Natural Science Foundation of China [61672550]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [17lgjc45],"This work is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFB0802500), Supported by Guangxi Key Laboratory of Cryptography and Information Security (No.GCIS201711), Natural Science Foundation of China (61672550), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 17lgjc45).",,9,34,35,6,105,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The cost of a robotic unit is fixed, so institutions must maximize use of each unit by utilizing all available operating room block time. One way to increase utilization is to accurately predict case durations. In this study, we sought to use machine learning to develop an accurate predictive model for RAS case duration. We analyzed a random sample of robotic cases at our institution from January 2014 to June 2017. We compared the machine learning models to the baseline model, which is the scheduled case duration (determined by previous case duration averages and surgeon adjustments). Specifically, we used: 1) multivariable linear regression, 2) ridge regression, 3) lasso regression, 4) random forest, 5) boosted regression tree, and 6) neural network. We found that all machine learning models decreased the average root-mean-squared error (RMSE) as compared to the baseline model. The average RMSE was lowest with the boosted regression tree (80.2min, 95% CI 74.0-86.4), which was significantly lower than the baseline model (100.4min, 95% CI 90.5-110.3). Using boosted regression tree, we can increase the number of accurately booked cases from 148 to 219 (34.9% to 51.7%, p<0.001). This study shows that using various machine learning approaches can improve the accuracy of RAS case length predictions, which will increase utilization of this limited resource. Further work is needed to operationalize these findings.","[Zhao, Beiqun] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Surg, 9300 Campus Point Dr,7220, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Zhao, Beiqun; Gabriel, Rodney A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, Div Biomed Informat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Waterman, Ruth S.; Gabriel, Rodney A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Anesthesiol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Urman, Richard D.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Zhao, BQ (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Surg, 9300 Campus Point Dr,7220, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.;Zhao, BQ (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, Div Biomed Informat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",beiqunmzhao@gmail.com,"Urman, Richard/ABG-4830-2020; Urman, Richard/AAH-7758-2019; Zhao, Beiqun/AAO-8858-2020","Urman, Richard/0000-0002-0516-5977; Zhao, Beiqun/0000-0003-2181-3783",National Library of Medicine Training Grant [T15LM011271],This study was funded by the National Library of Medicine Training Grant (T15LM011271).,,24,20,20,2,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Data mining (DM) offers a set of powerful techniques that allow the identification and extraction of relevant information from medical datasets, thus enabling doctors and patients to greatly benefit from DM, particularly in the case of diseases with high mortality and morbidity rates, such as heart disease (HD). Nonetheless, the use of raw medical data implies several challenges, such as missing data, noise, redundancy and high dimensionality, which make the extraction of useful and relevant information difficult and challenging. Intensive research has, therefore, recently begun in order to prepare raw healthcare data before knowledge extraction. In any knowledge data discovery (KDD) process, data preparation is the step prior to DM that deals with data imperfectness in order to improve its quality so as to satisfy the requirements and improve the performances of DM techniques. The objective of this paper is to perform a systematic mapping study (SMS) on data preparation for KDD in cardiology so as to provide an overview of the quantity and type of research carried out in this respect. The SMS consisted of a set of 58 selected papers published in the period January 2000 and December 2017. The selected studies were analyzed according to six criteria: year and channel of publication, preparation task, medical task, DM objective, research type and empirical type. The results show that a high amount of data preparation research was carried out in order to improve the performance of DM-based decision support systems in cardiology. Researchers were mainly interested in the data reduction preparation task and particularly in feature selection. Moreover, the majority of the selected studies focused on classification for the diagnosis of HD. Two main research types were identified in the selected studies: solution proposal and evaluation research, and the most frequently used empirical type was that of historical-based evaluation.","[Benhar, H.; Idri, A.] Univ Mohammed V Rabat, ENSIAS, Software Project Management Res Team, BP 713, Rabat, Morocco; [Fernandez-Aleman, J.

The glycemic index varies in the human of improper diet and eating pattern such as junk foods, variation in the quantity of food, swallowing of food without chewing and stress. However, the diagnose of increase or decrease in the glycemic index is a challenging task. Similarly, the regulation of glycemic index without regular exercise is a major problem in day to day life. In this paper, we propose a novel SCS method to regulate glycemic index without exercise through changing the eating method. The proposed SCS eating method consists of Size of the food, Chewing style and Swallow time (SCS) of the food to regulate glycemic index. Furthermore, the proposed SCS method evaluate and validate through the acoustic signal acquired and processed with deep learning algorithm to analyze the chewing pattern of food to formulate a standard procedure for eating style and to reduce the glycemic level. The validation of diabetes done by measurement of blood glycemic through AccuChek Instant S Glucometer. Furthermore, the SCS method of eating style from 50 diabetes persons reduces the blood glucose level drastically by 85% after following the proposed method of eating style.","[Kumari, S.

In this paper, a Hybrid Multi-resolution filter for denoising the MRI images degraded by the Salt and Pepper noise is proposed and the wavelet transform is used to improve the resolution of the denoised image.. The Hybrid filter consist of three value weighted filter and similarity based filter. In three value weighted filter, a variable local window is applied to find the noisy pixels. By using the noise free pixels in that window, the noisy pixels are reconstructed using three value method. In similarity based filter, a variable local window is applied to reconstruct the noisy pixels. In that window, based on the similarity between the noisy pixel sequence and noise free pixels sequence are used to reconstruct the noisy pixel. At last wavelet transform is used to increase the resolution of the reconstructed image. The experimental results shows that the proposed filter denoises the image and improves the resolution when compared to the existing methods and produces the efficiency of about 98%.","[Murugan, K.] Tamilnadu Coll Engn, Dept ECE, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Arunachalam, V.

To make these communications secure, user authentication by medical servers is considered as a crucial requirement. For this purpose, many user authentication and key agreement protocols have been put forwrad in order to fulfil this vital necessity. Recently, Arshad and Rasoolzadegan have revealed that not only the authentication and key agreement protocols suggested by Amin and Biswas and Giri et al. are defenseless against the replay attack and do not support the perfect forward secrecy, but also Amin and Biswas's protocol is susceptible to the offline password guessing attack. Nonetheless, in this paper, we demonstrate that Arshad and Rasoolzadegan's and the other existing schemes still fail to resist a well-known attack. Therefore, to cover this security gap, a new user authentication and session key agreement protocol is recommended that can be employed effectively for offering secure communication channels in TMIS. Our comparative security and performance analyses reveal that the proposed scheme can both solve the existing security drawback and, same as Arshad and Rasoolzadegan's scheme, has low communication and computational overheads.","[Ostad-Sharif, Arezou; Abbasinezhad-Mood, Dariush; Nikooghadam, Morteza] Imam Reza Int Univ, Dept Comp Engn & Informat Technol, Mashhad, Iran","Nikooghadam, M (corresponding author), Imam Reza Int Univ, Dept Comp Engn & Informat Technol, Mashhad, Iran.",arezou.ostadsharif@imamreza.ac.ir; dariush.abbasinezhad@imamreza.ac.ir; m.nikooghadam@imamreza.ac,"Nikooghadam, Morteza/AAR-7984-2020; Abbasinezhad-Mood, Dariush/B-2199-2019; Ostad-Sharif, Arezou/X-2128-2019","Nikooghadam, Morteza/0000-0003-3894-3103; Abbasinezhad-Mood, Dariush/0000-0003-4943-1154; Ostad Sharif, Arezou/0000-0002-1649-0783",,,,44,32,32,2,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The identification of similar face with inter class similarity is very difficult in imaging. The imaging technology faces difficult in the mounting of intra class variability because of accommodate, intra-class variability because of head pose, illumination conditions, expressions, facial accessories, aging effects and cartoon faces. In the earliest approach, gradient with Zernike momemts were used to regonize the faces, the performance is low to overcome this a new approach is introduced. Many features of FR are affected by the outcome and low occurrence of performance is observed which is applicable only for data sets that are smaller. The introduction of a new approach can overcome the above stated limitations. This paper describes a novel approach for LS enhancement technique using GSNO and CWSNO, and extracts the PCA features with three ways such as mean, median and mode which are then classified with MD classifier using LOOCV of R-SM to recognize the faces. The performance metrics is also computed and compared. Performance metrics of the proposed approach and the current approach are computed and compared. Thus, the suggested method is useful for increasing the visibility of facial recognition, and overcoming a pose, similarity and illumination problem, which provides a more accurate investigation of the required recognition procedures.","[Rathika, N.; Suresh, P.; Sathya, N.] PSN Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, India","Rathika, N (corresponding author), PSN Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, India.",rathika.111287@gmail.com; suresh3982@gmail.com; sathyaeie@gmail.com,"P, Suresh/D-2981-2014","P, Suresh/0000-0002-0488-972X",,,,29,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Our aim was to evaluate the effects of a mobile CT examination workflow on the radiographers' performance compared to conventional examinations. A prototype of a radiation protection cabin was installed besides the gantry of a CT system. The CT system was equipped with a simplified user interface on a portable tablet and a mobile remote control. 98 patients with an indication for CT of the chest were randomly assigned to examination using the mobile devices (study group, n=47) or using the conventional stationary workflow on the console (reference group, n=51). Three ceiling mounted fisheye cameras were used for motion tracking of the radiographers, two in the examination room and one in the control room. Relative density of detection heat-maps and area counts were assessed using a dedicated software tool to quantify radiographers' movements. Duration of each task of the examination was manually recorded using a stopwatch. In the reference group 25% of the area counts were located inside of the examination room, while it was 48% in the study group. The time spent in the same room with the patient increased from 3:06min (29%) to 6:01min (57%) using the mobile workflow (p<0.05), thereof 0:59min (9%) were spent in moderate separation with maintained voice and visual contact in the radiation protection cabin. Heat-maps showed an increase of the radiographer's working area, indicating a higher freedom of movement. Total duration of the examination was slightly less in the study group without statistical significance (median time: study 10:36, reference 10:50min; p=0.29). A mobile CT examination transfers the radiographers' interaction with the scanner from the control room into the examination room. There, radiographers' freedom of movement is higher, without any tradeoffs regarding the examination duration.","[Wetzl, Matthias; Heiss, Rafael; Schruefer, Eleni; Wuest, Wolfgang; Cavallaro, Alexander; Uder, Michael; May, Matthias Stefan] Univ Hosp Erlangen, Dept Radiol, Maximilianspl 3, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Weller, Melanie; Thierfelder, Carsten; Lerch, Daniel] Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Siemensstr 3, D-91301 Forchheim, Germany; [Cavallaro, Alexander; Amarteifio, Patrick; Uder, Michael; May, Matthias Stefan] Univ Hosp Erlangen, Imaging Sci Inst, Ulmenweg 18, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Amarteifio, Patrick] Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Henkestr 127, D-91052 Erlangen, Germany","May, MS (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Erlangen, Dept Radiol, Maximilianspl 3, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.;May, MS (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Erlangen, Imaging Sci Inst, Ulmenweg 18, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.",Matthias.May@uk-erlangen.de,"May, Matthias/AAZ-4877-2021","May, Matthias/0000-0002-2540-850X",,,,17,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In order to overcome the shortcomings of automatic kidney segmentation based on deep network for abdominal CT images, a two-stage semantic segmentation of kidney and space-occupying lesion area based on SCNN and ResNet models combined with SIFT-flow transformation is proposed in paper, which is divided into two stages: image retrieval and semantic segmentation. To facilitate the image retrieval, a metric learning-based approach is firstly adopted to construct a deep convolutional neural network structure using SCNN and ResNet network to extract image features and minimize the impact of interference factors on features, so as to obtain the ability to represent the abdominal CT scan image with the same angle under different imaging conditions. And then, SIFT Flow transformation is introduced, which adopts MRF to fuse label information, priori spatial information and smoothing information to establish the dense matching relationship of pixels so that the semantics can be transferred from the known image to the target image so as to obtain the semantic segmentation result of kidney and space-occupying lesion area. In order to validate effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on self-establish CT dataset, focus on kidney organ and most of which have tumors inside of the kidney, and abnormal deformed shape of kidney. The experimental results qualitatively and quantitatively show that the accuracy of kidney segmentation is greatly improved, and the key information of the proportioned tumor occupying a small area of the image are exhibited a good segmentation results. In addition, our algorithm has also achieved ideal results in the clinical verification, which is suitable for intelligent medicine equipment applications.","[Xia, Kai-jian; Yin, Hong-sheng] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Informat & Control Engn, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xia, Kai-jian] Soochow Univ, Changshu Affiliated Hosp, Changshu Peoples Hosp 1, Changshu 215500, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yu-dong] Univ Leicester, Dept Informat, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England","Xia, KJ; Yin, HS (corresponding author), China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Informat & Control Engn, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Xia, KJ (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Changshu Affiliated Hosp, Changshu Peoples Hosp 1, Changshu 215500, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xiakaijian@163.com; xuzhouyhs@sina.com; yudongzhang@ieee.org,"Zhang, Yudong/I-7633-2013","Zhang, Yudong/0000-0002-4870-1493; Xia, Kaijian/0000-0002-1650-9982",Jiangsu Committee of Health on the subject [H2018071],This paper is supported by the Jiangsu Committee of Health on the subject (No. H2018071).,,29,58,58,3,73,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Augmented reality (AR) systems with contactless tracking of the hand and upper body offer opportunities for objective quantification of motor (dys)function in a challenging, engaging and patient-tailored environment. In this study, we explore the potential of AR for evaluating 1) speed and goal-directedness of movements within the individually determined interaction space, 2) adaptation of hand opening to objects of different sizes, and 3) obstacle avoidance in healthy individuals (N=10) and two highly prevalent neurological conditions (N=10 patients with Parkinson's Disease and N=10 stroke patients). We successfully implemented three AR games to evaluate these key aspects of motor function. As expected, PD patients moved slower than controls and needed more time for task completion. No differences were observed between stroke patients and controls, perhaps because motor impairments in this patient group were relatively mild. Importantly, usability of our AR system was good and considerably improved compared to our previous study due to more natural and patient-tailored interaction. Although our findings testify to the potential of AR for assessing motor impairments in patients with neurological conditions and provide starting points for further improvement, there are still many steps to be taken towards application in clinical practice.","[Bank, Paulina J.

First the Input signal is preprocessed by using filtering method such as low pass, high pass and butter worth filter to remove the high frequency noise. Butter worth filter is to remove the excess noise in the signal. After preprocessing peak points are detected by using peak detection algorithm and extract the features for the signal are extracted using statistical parameters. Finally, extracted features are classified by using SVM, Adaboost, ANN and Naive Bayes classifier to classify the ECG signal database into normal or abnormal ECG signal.

We analyzed 2592 Instagram posts between August 2016 and April 2017 on a related hashtag (#lasiksurgery). Content was coded based on time frame of the post in relation to the procedure, references to return to work/activity, post-surgical photographs, mention of the surgical institution, tone, and complaints regarding the procedure. Twitter and Instagram accounts for 30 ophthalmologists and eye institutes were also located. The 20 most recent posts were categorized by message type and topic (physicians, patients, education, conference, etc.). Patients using the hashtag posted photographs (92%), had a positive tone (88%), referenced the clinic where they were treated (62%), and posted during the day of the procedure (44%). Ophthalmologists' personal tweets focused on research conferences (35%), personal topics (25%), and the accomplishments of other physicians (21%). Eye institutions generally posted content relating to institutional promotion (22%), physician accomplishments (20%), and research publications (19%). Similar to other medical specialties, ophthalmology has a meaningful presence on both Twitter and Instagram. While LASIK patients tend to comment on their renewed vision and return to activity, ophthalmologists post to promote their research and accomplishments.","[Clarke, Cameron] Baylor Coll Med, Sch Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Smith, Eric] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Long Sch Med, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA; [Khan, Mahmood; Al-Mohtaseb, Zaina] Baylor Coll Med, Cullen Eye Inst, Dept Ophthalmol, 6565 Fannin,NC205, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Al-Mohtaseb, Z (corresponding author), Baylor Coll Med, Cullen Eye Inst, Dept Ophthalmol, 6565 Fannin,NC205, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",zaina@bcm.edu,,,,,,18,11,11,1,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Crowding gives rise to long ER waiting times, patient dissatisfaction, and negative effects on a healthcare systems' performance. This paper focuses on the utilization of the Collective System Design (CSD) methodology to optimize the performance of an ER, which is of principal importance both from a life-threatening and an economic standpoint. The CSD technique is applied to detect areas of deficiency and to identify the functional requirements of the system to address those issues. The ER and system engineering specialists' team gathered data from the electronic medical center log and their system observation. The team determined the functional requirements and effective solutions, and implemented a continuous improvement plan to enhance ER performance. From a statistical standpoint, a significant decrease in the median of the door-to-doctor time measure (27minvs 13min) and a substantial improvement in the patients' level of satisfaction with the quality of health care (20th percentile vs 41th percentile) were observed after the implementation of the CSD methodology. The CSD methodology augments the implementation of lean tools by providing a language for defining the requirements and corresponding solutions for a system design. Using the CSD methodology, results in a significant increase in the ER's capacity to treat patients efficiently.","[Cochran, David; Smith, Joseph] Purdue Univ, Dept Syst Engn, Coll Engn Technol & Comp Sci, 2101 East Coliseum Blvd,Room 229 B, Ft Wayne, IN 46805 USA; [Swartz, Joseph] Franciscan Hlth Indianapolis, Dept Business Transformat, 8111 S Emerson Ave, Indianapolis, IN 46237 USA; [Elahi, Behin] Purdue Univ, Dept Mfg & Construct Engn Technol, Coll Engn Technol & Comp Sci, 2101 East Coliseum Blvd,Room 221 H, Ft Wayne, IN 46805 USA","Elahi, B (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Mfg & Construct Engn Technol, Coll Engn Technol & Comp Sci, 2101 East Coliseum Blvd,Room 221 H, Ft Wayne, IN 46805 USA.",cochrand@pfw.edu; joseph.swartz@franciscanalliance.org; belahi@purdue.edu; smitjj09@pfw.edu,"Elahi, Behin/AAR-4433-2021","elahi, behin/0000-0002-9575-9575",,,,30,2,2,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Given the complexity of the syndrome, prevention and early detection are critical in mitigating its effects. We used Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) screening and Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for 64,038 inpatient visits to train and test a model predicting delirium arising in hospital. Incident delirium was defined as the first instance of a positive CAM occurring at least 48h into a hospital stay. A Random Forest machine learning algorithm was used with demographic data, comorbidities, medications, procedures, and physiological measures. The data set was randomly partitioned 80% / 20% for training and validating the predictive model, respectively. Of the 51,240 patients in the training set, 2774 (5.4%) experienced delirium during their hospital stay; and of the 12,798 patients in the validation set, 701 (5.5%) experienced delirium. Under-sampling of the delirium negative population was used to address the class imbalance. The Random Forest predictive model yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) of 0.909 (95% CI 0.898 to 0.921). Important variables in the model included previously identified predisposing and precipitating risk factors. This machine learning approach displayed a high degree of accuracy and has the potential to provide a clinically useful predictive model for earlier intervention in those patients at greatest risk of developing delirium.","[Corradi, John P.; Thompson, Stephen; Mather, Jeffrey F.] Hartford Hosp, Res Dept, 80 Seymour St,ERD 223W, Hartford, CT 06102 USA; [Waszynski, Christine M.; Dicks, Robert S.] Hartford Hosp, Div Geriatr Med, Hartford, CT 06115 USA","Corradi, JP (corresponding author), Hartford Hosp, Res Dept, 80 Seymour St,ERD 223W, Hartford, CT 06102 USA.",john.corradi@hhchealth.org,,"Corradi, John/0000-0003-3456-4974",,,,45,18,18,2,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The method assumes that anesthesia staffing is planned based on the workload and not vice-versa. We used the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) meeting to test the assumption across a large population. The observational study cohort was all 3,191,282 major therapeutic procedures performed during 2,517,842 cases at all 121 non-federal hospitals in the State of Iowa, 2007-16. The Fridays to Wednesdays of the annual ASA meetings were compared pairwise by year with those days of the other (mean=43.0 [SE =0.3]) weeks without a federal holiday. Differences in counts of procedures (P=0.45, 0.5% [0.7%]) and cases performed (P=0.93, 0.1% [1.0%]) were not significant. In contrast, compared to non-meeting weeks, during the American College of Surgeons meeting, there were fewer general surgery procedures performed (P=0.0009, -9.1% [1.9%]), fewer procedures performed of any type (P=0.022, -2.1% [0.8]), and fewer cases of any type (P=0.003, -2.5% [0.6%]). Similarly, during the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons meeting, there were fewer joint arthroplasties performed (P<0.0001, -27.1% [3.1%]), fewer procedures (P=0.011, -6.3% [2.0%]), and fewer cases (P=0.018, -5.9% [2.0%]).

However, a prominent level of subjectivity and a low intra- and inter-rater reproducibility was reported. Therefore, an accurate and reproducible measure of psoriasis severity is needed, especially in the setting of registration studies for systemic anti-psoriatic drugs. Herein we describe a robust, user-friendly, computer-guided technology that allows for automated PASI measurements after total body imaging and digital image analysis. For this purpose, a novel image processing software for PASI calculations was developed, which was combined with a commercially available, automated image capturing system. Our data shows, that the software was able to accurately calculate the proportion of psoriatic skin surface as well as the severity of erythema, induration, and desquamation by anatomic region. In a pilot clinical validation the time-efficient technology showed a high reproducibility and high levels of agreement to results attained by PASI-trained physicians. Therefore, automated computer-guided PASI measurements hold the promise of significantly reducing the physicians' workload while ensuring a high level of reproducibility and standardization.","[Fink, Christine; Enk, Alexander; Haenssle, Holger A.] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Dermatol, Neuenheimer Feld 440, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Fuchs, Tobias] FotoFinder Syst GmbH, Bad Birnbach, Germany","Haenssle, HA (corresponding author), Heidelberg Univ, Dept Dermatol, Neuenheimer Feld 440, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",Holger.Haenssle@med.uni-heidelberg.de,,,,,,23,11,11,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

HIS has the potential to improve individuals' health and providers' performance by producing better quality, cost savings, and greater patient involvement in their own health. There have been two major drivers for the HIS investments in healthcare: The ever-increasing burden from chronic disease with costs growing significantly faster and the recognition of the need for greatly improved quality and safety in health delivery. Maturity models (MM) are based on the premises that people, organizations, functional areas and processes evolve through a process of development or growth towards a more advanced maturity, going through a distinct number of levels. Through a state-of-the-art review of HIS, focused on their maturity state, we identify and characterize a set of critical factors recognized as determinants in the context of HIS maturity.

It was observed that the conventional neural networks especially the Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) may be inaccurate due to the weight values are not adjusted in the training process. This paper presents a new Modified Hopfield Neural Network (MHNN) for abnormality classification from human retinal images. It relies on the idea that both weight values and output values can be adjusted simultaneously. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the training algorithm. In conventional method, the weights remain fixed but the weights are changing in the proposed method. Experimental performed on the Lotus Eye Care Hospital containing 540 images collected showed that the proposed MHNN yields an average sensitivity and specificity of 0.99 and accuracy of 99.25%.

ECG signal analysis can improve human life in many ways, from diagnosing diseases among cardiac patients to managing the lifestyles of diabetic patients. Abnormalities in heart activities lead to different cardiac diseases and arrhythmia. However, some cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarction (MI) and atrial fibrillation (Af), require special attention due to their direct impact on human life. The classification of flattened T wave cases of MI in ECG signals and how much of these cases are similar to ST-T changes in MI remain an open issue for researchers. This article presents a novel contribution to classify MI and Af. To this end, we propose a new approach called deep deterministic learning (DDL), which works by combining predefined heart activities with fused datasets. In this research, we used two datasets. The first dataset, Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital, is publicly available, and we exclusively obtained the second dataset from the University of Malaya Medical Center, Kuala Lumpur Malaysia. We first initiated predefined activities on each individual dataset to recognize patterns between the ST-T change and flattened T wave cases and then used the data fusion approach to merge both datasets in a manner that delivers the most accurate pattern recognition results. The proposed DDL approach is a systematic stage-wise methodology that relies on accurate detection of R peaks in ECG signals, time domain features of ECG signals, and fine tune-up of artificial neural networks. The empirical evaluation shows high accuracy (i.e., 99.97%) in pattern matching ST-T changes and flattened T waves using the proposed DDL approach.

The mean score of overall satisfaction rated on the 5-point Likert scale was 4.22 +/- 0.73. When the patients were grouped according to age, the overall satisfaction score increased significantly with age (P=0.040). Also, the satisfaction scores of patients with radiotherapy were significantly higher than patients without radiotherapy (P=0.001). In terms of system characteristics, the most satisfying was data transmission accuracy (4.32 +/- 0.74). In addition, patients were very satisfied with telephone counseling (4.55 +/- 0.62).

At present, the lesion annotation of early esophageal cancers (EEC) in gastroscopic images is generally performed by medical personnel in a clinic. To reduce the effect of subjectivity and fatigue in manual annotation, computer-aided annotation is required. However, automated annotation of EEC lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of EEC lesions. This study modifies the traditional EEC annotation framework and utilizes visual salient information to develop a two saliency levels-based lesion annotation (TSL-BLA) for EEC annotations on gastroscopic images. Unlike existing methods, the proposed framework has a strong ability of constraining false positive outputs. What is more, TSL-BLA is also placed an additional emphasis on the annotation of small EEC lesions. A total of 871 gastroscopic images from 231 patients were used to validate TSL-BLA. 365 of those images contain 434 EEC lesions and 506 images do not contain any lesions. 101 small lesion regions are extracted from the 434 lesions to further validate the performance of TSL-BLA. The experimental results show that the mean detection rate and Dice similarity coefficients of TSL-BLA were 97.24 and 75.15%, respectively. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, TSL-BLA shows better performance. Moreover, it shows strong superiority when annotating small EEC lesions. It also produces fewer false positive outputs and has a fast running speed. Therefore, The proposed method has good application prospects in aiding clinical EEC diagnoses.","[Liu, Dingyun; Rao, Nini; Mei, Xinming; Jiang, Hongxiu; Li, Quanchi; Luo, ChengSi; Li, Qian; Zeng, Chengshi] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Dingyun; Rao, Nini; Mei, Xinming; Jiang, Hongxiu; Li, Quanchi; Luo, ChengSi; Li, Qian; Zeng, Chengshi] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Ctr Informat Biol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Dingyun; Rao, Nini; Mei, Xinming; Jiang, Hongxiu; Li, Quanchi; Luo, ChengSi; Li, Qian; Zeng, Chengshi] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Minist Educ, Key Lab NeuroInformat, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Mei, Xinming] UESTC Guangdong, Inst Elect & Informat Engn, Dongguan, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Bing] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Commun & Informat Engn, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Gan, Tao] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Digest Endoscop Ctr, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Rao, NN (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Rao, NN (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Ctr Informat Biol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Rao, NN (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Minist Educ, Key Lab NeuroInformat, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Gan, T (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Digest Endoscop Ctr, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",raonn@uestc.edu.cn; gantaowest@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [61,872,405, 61,720,106,004]; Sichuan Science and Technology Support Program [2015SZ0191]; Key Project of Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2016A030311040]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [ZYGX2016J189]; Scientific Platform Improvement Project of UESTC","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61,872,405 and 61,720,106,004), the Sichuan Science and Technology Support Program (2015SZ0191), Key Project of Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2016A030311040), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (ZYGX2016J189) and Scientific Platform Improvement Project of UESTC.",,31,4,4,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In particular, degenerative diseases of the retina such as macular senile degenerations are on the rise and affect millions of people with hundreds of thousands of new cases each year. These diseases can cause profoundly disabling visual impairments, in some cases severely compromising the central and/or the peripheral vision in one or both eyes. In this paper, we present a novel vision aids technology that allows for correcting or attenuating the perception of visual field defects due to ocular pathologies of diverse origins or traumas by using techniques of 3D visualisation, eye tracking, and image processing. The presented technology is mainly conceived for providing vision aids that can significantly improve the quality of life of people with this kind of visual disorders. As well, it could be employed for supporting the diagnosis of ocular dysfunctions and for monitoring the progression of diseases.

The biometric technology provides crucial properties for biometric features that can support the process of personal identification. The storage of biometric template within a central database makes it vulnerable to attack which can also occur during data transmission. Therefore, an alternative mechanism of protection becomes important to develop. On this basis, this study focuses on providing a detailed analysis of the extant literature (2013-2018) to identify the taxonomy and research distribution. Furthermore, this study also seeks to ascertain the challenges and motivations associated with biometric steganography in real-time medical systems to provide recommendations that can enhance the efficient use of real-time medical systems in biometric steganography and its applications. A review of articles on human biometric steganography in real-time medical systems obtained from three main databases (IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and Web of Science) is conducted according to an appropriate review protocol. Then, 41 related articles are selected by using exclusion and inclusion criteria. Majority of the studies reviewed had been conducted in the field of data-hiding (particularly steganography) technologies. In this review, various steganographic methods that have been applied in different human biometrics are investigated. Thereafter, these methods are categorised according to taxonomy, and the results are presented on the basis of human steganography biometric real-time medical systems, testing and evaluation methods, significance of use and applications and techniques. Finally, recommendations on how the challenges associated with data hiding can be addressed are provided to enhance the efficiency of using biometric information processed in any authentication real-time medical system. These recommendations are expected to be immensely helpful to developers, company users and researchers.","[Mohsin, A. H.; Zaidan, A. A.; Zaidan, B. B.; bin Ariffin, Shamsul Arrieya; Albahri, O.

However, attackers and cybercriminals are gradually becoming aware in attacking telemedicine systems, and the black market value of protected health information has the highest price nowadays. Security remains a formidable challenge to be resolved. Intelligent home environments make up one of the major application areas of pervasive computing. Security and privacy are the two most important issues in the remote monitoring and control of intelligent home environments for clients and servers in telemedicine architecture. The personal authentication approach that uses the finger vein pattern is a newly investigated biometric technique. This type of biometric has many advantages over other types (explained in detail later on) and is suitable for different human categories and ages. This study aims to establish a secure verification method for real-time monitoring systems to be used for the authentication of patients and other members who are working in telemedicine systems. The process begins with the sensor based on Tiers 1 and 2 (client side) in the telemedicine architecture and ends with patient verification in Tier 3 (server side) via finger vein biometric technology to ensure patient security on both sides. Multilayer taxonomy is conducted in this research to attain the study's goal. In the first layer, real-time remote monitoring studies based on the sensor technology used in telemedicine applications are reviewed and analysed to provide researchers a clear vision of security and privacy based on sensors in telemedicine. An extensive search is conducted to identify articles that deal with security and privacy issues, related applications are reviewed comprehensively and a coherent taxonomy of these articles is established. ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore and Web of Science databases are checked for articles on mHealth in telemedicine based on sensors. A total of 3064 papers are collected from 2007 to 2017. The retrieved articles are filtered according to the security and privacy of telemedicine applications based on sensors. Nineteen articles are selected and classified into two categories. The first category, which accounts for 57.89% (n=11/19), includes surveys on telemedicine articles and their applications. The second category, accounting for 42.1% (n=8/19), includes articles on the three-tiered architecture of telemedicine. The collected studies reveal the essential need to construct another taxonomy layer and review studies on finger vein biometric verification systems. This map-matching for both taxonomies is developed for this study to go deeply into the sensor field and determine novel risks and benefits for patient security and privacy on client and server sides in telemedicine applications. In the second layer of our taxonomy, the literature on finger vein biometric verification systems is analysed and reviewed. In this layer, we obtain a final set of 65 articles classified into four categories. In the first category, 80% (n=52/65) of the articles focus on development and design. In the second category, 12.30% (n=8/65) includes evaluation and comparative articles. These articles are not intensively included in our literature analysis. In the third category, 4.61% (n=3/65) includes articles about analytical studies. In the fourth category, 3.07% (n=2/65) comprises reviews and surveys. This study aims to provide researchers with an up-to-date overview of studies that have been conducted on (user/patient) authentication to enhance the security level in telemedicine or any information system. In the current study, taxonomy is presented by explaining previous studies. Moreover, this review highlights the motivations, challenges and recommendations related to finger vein biometric verification systems and determines the gaps in this research direction (protection of finger vein templates in real time), which represent a new research direction in this area.","[Mohsin, A.

In the first stage, with respect to the cells' boundary, it is necessary to further processing, which ensures the boundary of some cells is a discrete region. Mathematical Morphology brings a fancy result during the discrete processing. Accurate cancer cell nucleus segmentation is necessary for automated cytological image analysis.

The purpose of this study was to audit compliance of a pediatric complicated appendicitis CPG to identify areas for continued improvement. A comprehensive complicated appendicitis CPG was implemented in a children's hospital system. Outcomes were compared for 48months pre- (01/2012 to 12/2015) and 28months post-implementation (01/2016 to 04/2018). A detailed compliance audit was nested within the post-implementation period in 60 consecutive patients from 11/2017 to 03/2018. Feedback was provided to care providers throughout the audit. Overall, 2370 children with complicated appendicitis were identified (1366 pre-CPG and 1004 post-CPG). The CPG resulted in decrease in mean length of stay from 5.3days to 4.5days (p=0.751), postoperative returns to the system (13.0% to 10.1%, p=0.030), and readmissions (5.3% to 4.3%, p=0.237). Central line use decreased from 11.2% to 5.5% (p<0.001) and antibiotic selection improved from 47.0% to 84.1% (p<0.001). On audit, only 15% (9/60) had full CPG compliance and 49% (29/60) received recommended antibiotic durations. Compliance increased from 7% to 23% with audit-derived feedback. After stratifying by appendicitis severity, audits resulted in improved antibiotic duration compliance for patients with severe appendicitis (38.1% to 66.7%, p=0.07) and postoperative ambulation for patients with lower grade disease (37.5% to 83.3%, p=0.06).

However, ICA-based MIBCI (ICA-MIBCI) is sensitive to electroencephalogram (EEG) channels and the quality of the training data, which are two crucial factors affecting the stability and classification performance of ICA-MIBCI. To address these problems, this paper is mainly focused on the investigation of EEG channel optimization. As a reference, we constructed a single-trial-based ICA-MIBCI system with commonly used channels and common spatial pattern-based MIBCI (CSP-MIBCI). To minimize the impact of artifacts on EEG channel optimization, a data-quality evaluation method, named self-testing in this paper, was used in a single-trial-based ICA-MIBCI system to evaluate the quality of single trials in each dataset; the resulting self-testing accuracies were used for the selection of high-quality trials. Given several candidate channel configurations, ICA filters were calculated using selected high-quality trials and applied to the corresponding ICA-MIBCI implementation. Optimal channels for each dataset were assessed and selected according to the self-testing results related to various candidate configurations. Forty-eight MI datasets of six subjects were employed in this study to validate the proposed methods. Experimental results revealed that the average classification accuracy of the optimal channels yielded a relative increment of 2.8% and 8.5% during self-testing, 14.4% and 9.5% during session-to-session transfer, and 36.2% and 26.7% during subject-to-subject transfer compared to CSP-MIBCI and ICA-MIBCI with fixed the channel configuration. This work indicates that the proposed methods can efficiently improve the practical feasibility of ICA-MIBCI.","[Ruan, Jing; Wu, Xiaopei; Zhou, Bangyan; Guo, Xiaojing; Lv, Zhao] Anhui Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Intelligent Comp & Signal Proc, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Ruan, Jing; Wu, Xiaopei; Zhou, Bangyan; Guo, Xiaojing; Lv, Zhao] Anhui Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China","Wu, XP (corresponding author), Anhui Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Intelligent Comp & Signal Proc, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.;Wu, XP (corresponding author), Anhui Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.",wxp2001@ahu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [61271352] Funding Source: Medline; University Natural Science Research Project of Anhui Province [KJ2016A043] Funding Source: Medline; Anhui University Center of Information Support & Assurance Technology Open Foundation [ADXXBZ201505] Funding Source: Medline,,,50,9,9,2,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In terms of surface area and penetration depth 4x1 HD-tDCS and 2mA weak dc current configuration has been selected. The optimized 4x1 HD-tDCS configuration is placed on target location of the brain surface and the changes in the magnitude of current density and magnitude of electric field distribution is calculated at the different locations on brain surface including scalp surface, skull surface gray matter and white matter surface. The variation in magnitude electric field distribution is seen in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), gray and white matter surface of target cerebral cortex. Based on the insights received from the variation in the magnitude of current density and magnitude of electric field distribution, the design of an appropriate NIRS probe has been proposed to aid in non-invasive brain stimulation. Designed NIRS probe is based on distance of separation between source and photodetector to cover the affected area with 4x1 HD-tDCS technique and measurement sensitivity distribution at gray matter surface of cerebral cortex. The estimated percentage of pixel area of measurement sensitivity distribution is 17.094%, which confirm to cover the 7.9384% distributed pixel area in term of calculated magnitude of current density affected with 4x1 HD-tDCS configuration.","[Sharma, Gaurav; Chowdhury, Shubhajit Roy] Indian Inst Technol Mandi, Sch Comp & Elect Engn, Biomed Syst Lab, MANAS Grp, Kamand, Himachal Prades, India","Chowdhury, SR (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Mandi, Sch Comp & Elect Engn, Biomed Syst Lab, MANAS Grp, Kamand, Himachal Prades, India.",src@iitmandi.ac.in,"Roy Chowdhury, Shubhajit/K-8748-2018","Roy Chowdhury, Shubhajit/0000-0003-1878-6657; sharma, gaurav/0000-0001-7934-0531",,,,48,7,7,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Conventional manual assessment methods mainly rely on personal experience in observing X-ray images of left hand and wrist to calculate bone age, which show some intrinsic limitations from low efficiency to unstable accuracy. To address these problems, some automated methods based on image processing or machine learning have been proposed, while their performances are not satisfying enough yet in assessment accuracy. Motivated by the remarkable success of deep learning (DL) techniques in the fields of image classification and speech recognition, we develop a deep automated skeletal bone age assessment model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and support vector regression (SVR) using multiple kernel learning (MKL) algorithm to process heterogeneous features in this paper. This deep framework has been constructed, not only exploring the X-ray images of hand and twist but also some other heterogeneous information like race and gender. The experiment results prove its better performance with higher bone age assessment accuracy on two different data sets compared with the state of the art, indicating that the fused heterogeneous features provide a better description of the degree of bones' maturation.","[Tong, Chao; Liang, Baoyu; Li, Jun] Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Tong, Chao; Liang, Baoyu; Li, Jun] Zhengzhou Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Natl Engn Lab Internet Med Syst & Applicat, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Zhigao] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China","Zheng, ZG (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",zhengzhigao@hust.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [61472024, U1433203]; National Engineering Laboratory for Internet Medical System and Application [NELIMSA2018P01]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61472024, U1433203), Project of National Engineering Laboratory for Internet Medical System and Application (NELIMSA2018P01).",,27,12,13,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Currently, medical innovation curricula are taught through semester-long courses or year-long fellowships at a handful of universities, reaching only a limited demographic of participants. This study describes the structure and preliminary outcomes of a 1-2week extended hackathon course that seeks to make medical innovation education and training more accessible and easily adoptable for academic medical centers. Eight extended hackathons were hosted in five international locations reaching 245 participants: Beijing (June 2015 and August 2016), Hong Kong (June 2016, 2017, and 2018), Curitiba (July 2016), Stanford (October 2017), and SAo Paulo (May 2018). Pre- and post-hackathon surveys asking respondents to self-assess their knowledge in ten categories of medical innovation were administered to quantify the perceived degree of learning. Participants hailed from a diverse range of educational backgrounds, domains of expertise, and academic institutions. On average, respondents (n=161) saw a greater than twofold increase (114.1%, P<0.001) from their pre- to post-hackathon scores. In this study, the extended hackathon is presented as a novel educational model to teach undergraduate and graduate students a foundational skillset for medical innovation. Participants reported gaining significant knowledge across all ten categories assessed. To more robustly assess the educational value of extended hackathons, a standardized assessment for medical innovation knowledge needs to be developed, and a larger sample size of participants surveyed.","[Wang, Jason K.] Stanford Univ, Math & Computat Sci Dept, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pamnani, Ravinder D.; Capasso, Robson; Chang, Robert T.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Byers Ctr Biodesign, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Capasso, Robson] Stanford Univ, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Sleep Surg Div, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Chang, Robert T.] Stanford Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Chang, Robert T.] Stanford Byers Eye Inst, 2452 Watson Ct MC 5353, Palo Alto, CA 94303 USA","Chang, RT (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Stanford Byers Ctr Biodesign, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Chang, RT (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Chang, RT (corresponding author), Stanford Byers Eye Inst, 2452 Watson Ct MC 5353, Palo Alto, CA 94303 USA.",viroptic@gmail.com,,"Wang, Jason/0000-0002-5559-4323; Capasso, Robson/0000-0003-2645-1793",Stanford Center at Peking University; Stanford's Freeman Spogli Institute; Associated Medical Supplies Co Ltd.; Defond; metos; Vincent Medical; SGS Hong Kong Limited; Terraillon; MediConcepts; Braile Biomedica; Phillips; Johnson Johnson; Hospital Marcelino Champagnat; SGS Hong Kong; Boston Scientific Asia-Pacific; Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein; Persona Surgical Modelling Co.

Due to the advent of low-cost gaming systems and patient preference for game-based therapies, video game technology will likely be increasingly utilized in physical therapy practice in the coming years. Gaming systems that incorporate low-cost motion capture technology often generate large datasets of therapeutic movements performed over the course of rehabilitation. An infrastructure has yet to be established, however, to enable efficient processing of large quantities of movement data that are collected outside of a controlled laboratory setting. In this paper, a methodology is presented for extracting and evaluating therapeutic movements from game-based rehabilitation that occurs in uncontrolled and unmonitored settings. By overcoming these challenges, meaningful kinematic analysis of rehabilitation trajectory within an individual becomes feasible. Moreover, this methodological approach provides a vehicle for analyzing large datasets generated in uncontrolled clinical settings to enable better predictions of rehabilitation potential and dose-response relationships for personalized medicine.","[Yang, Zhichao] Univ Massachusetts, Coll Informat & Comp Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Rafiei, Mohammad H.; Hall, Alexis; Thomas, Caroline; Midtlien, Hali A.; Hasselbach, Alexander; Gauthier, Lynne V.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Rafiei, Mohammad H.; Adeli, Hojjat] Ohio State Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Rafiei, Mohammad H.; Adeli, Hojjat] Ohio State Univ, Dept Neurol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Rafiei, Mohammad H.; Adeli, Hojjat] Ohio State Univ, Dept Neurosci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Rafiei, Mohammad H.; Gauthier, Lynne V.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Phys Therapy, Lowell, MA 01854 USA","Adeli, H (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;Adeli, H (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Neurol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;Adeli, H (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Neurosci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",zhichaoyang@umass.edu; rafiei.4@osu.edu; 15.alexis.hall@gmail.com; cthomas456@gmail.com; midtlien.1@osu.edu; hasselbach.8@osu.edu; adeli.1@osu.edu; lynne_gauthier@uml.edu,"adeli, hojjat/D-1430-2010","adeli, hojjat/0000-0001-5718-1453; Hasselbach, Alexander/0000-0001-5801-741X; Yang, Zhichao/0000-0002-2797-4257","National Multiple Sclerosis Society; Rudi Schulte Foundation, Santa Barbara, CA; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences [8UL1TR000090-05]; Participant-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI); Rudi Schulte Foundation; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES [UL1TR002733] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Participant-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), Rudi Schulte Foundation, Santa Barbara, CA, and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (Grant #8UL1TR000090-05).

Although the points-of-care has more attractive advantages compared with traditional health care systems, some important issues still require a serious consideration such as privacy protection and the security of the transmitted biomedical signals. In this study, we propose a novel authentication and key agreement mechanism that ensures privacy preservation and provides biomedical signals protection during the communication process by negotiating a shared key to encrypt/decrypt sensitive information. Chaotic maps are employed in our design to achieve mutual authentication and key agreement for resource-constrained points-of-care, which also increases the efficiency in comparison with those schemes designed by Elliptic Curve Cryptography or RSA. Furthermore, dynamic identities are adopted in the proposed scheme to achieve user anonymity and user untraceability for the high-privacy-required points-of-care. The security of the proposed scheme is proven via Real-or-Random model. The performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme reduces computational overhead in comparison with the state-of-the-art schemes.","[Zhang, Liping; Luo, He; Zhao, Lanchao; Zhang, Yixin] China Univ Geosci, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China","Zhao, LC (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",645880508@qq.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China (CN) [61303237] Funding Source: Medline,,,31,3,4,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In order to run the Treatment Pathways in Chronic Disease protocol in Chinese data sources,we have built a large data research and analysis platform for Chinese clinical medical data. Data sourced from the Clinical Data Repository (CDR) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University was extracted, transformed, and loaded into an observational medical outcomes partnership common data model (OMOP CDM) Ver. 5.0. Diagnosis and medication information for patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and depression from 2005 to 2015 were extracted for observational research to obtain treatment pathways for the three diseases. The most common medications used to treat diabetes and hypertension were metformin and acarbose, respectively, at 28.5 and 20.9% as first-line medication. New drugs were emerging for depression; therefore, the favorite medication changed accordingly. Most patients with these three diseases had different treatment pathways from other patients with the same diseases. The proportions of monotherapy increased for the three diseases, especially in recent years. The recommendations presented in guidelines show some predominance. High-quality, effective guidelines incorporating domestic facts should be established to further guide medication and improve therapy at local hospitals. Medical institutions at all levels could improve the quality of medical services, and further standardize medications in the future. This research is the first application of the CDM model and OHDSI software in China, which were used to study, treatment pathways for three chronic diseases (hypertension, type 2 diabetes and depression), compare the pathways with recommendations from guidelines, discuss differences and standardization of medications in different medical institutions, demonstrate the urgent need for quality national guidelines, explores population diversification and changes of clinical treatment, and provide clinical big data analysis-based data support for the development and study of drugs in China.","[Zhang, Xin; Miao, Shumei; Yin, Yuechuchu; Zhu, Yueshi; Dai, Zuolei; Shan, Tao; Jing, Shenqi; Wang, Jian; Zhang, Xiaoliang; Huang, Zhongqiu; Wang, Zhongmin; Guo, Jianjun; Liu, Yun] Nanjing Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Informat, 300 Guang Zhou Rd, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xin; Miao, Shumei; Yin, Yuechuchu; Zhu, Yueshi; Dai, Zuolei; Shan, Tao; Jing, Shenqi; Wang, Jian; Zhang, Xiaoliang; Huang, Zhongqiu; Wang, Zhongmin; Guo, Jianjun; Liu, Yun] Nanjing Med Univ, Inst Med Informat & Management, 300 Guang Zhou Rd, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xin; Liu, Yun] Nanjing Med Univ, Sch Biomed Engn & Informat, 101Longmian Ave, Nanjing 211166, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Li] Nantong Univ, Dept Med Informat, Sch Med, 19 Qixiu Rd, Nantong 226001, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Hua] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Biomed Informat, Houston, TX 77030 USA","Liu, Y (corresponding author), Nanjing Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Informat, 300 Guang Zhou Rd, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Liu, Y (corresponding author), Nanjing Med Univ, Inst Med Informat & Management, 300 Guang Zhou Rd, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Liu, Y (corresponding author), Nanjing Med Univ, Sch Biomed Engn & Informat, 101Longmian Ave, Nanjing 211166, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",liuyun@njmu.edu.cn,,"wang, li/0000-0003-2838-9807; liu, yun/0000-0002-6431-4469","National key Research & Development plan of Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China [2018YFC1314900, 2018YFC1314901, 2018YFC0116900, 2018YFC0116902]; 2016 industry prospecting and common key technology key projects of Jiangsu Province Science and Technology Department [BE2016002-4]; 2014 information projects of Jiangsu Province Health and Life Committee [X201401]; 2016 projects of Nanjing Science Bureau [201608003]; national science foundation of China [81873915]","This work was supported by grants from the National key Research & Development plan of Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China(Grant no. 2018YFC1314900,2018YFC1314901,2018YFC0116900,2018YFC0116902), the 2016 industry prospecting and common key technology key projects of Jiangsu Province Science and Technology Department (Grant no.

Normal variations of lung consistent with the maintenance of pulmonary health and abnormal lung variations can be as a result of a pulmonary disease. Inter-patient lung variations can be due to the several factors such as sex, age, height, weight and type of disease. This study tries to show the inter-patient lung variations by using one of the shape-based descriptions techniques which is called Fourier descriptors. Shape-based description is an important approach to construct an object according to its parametric values. A different types of techniques are reported in the literature that aim to represent objects based on their shapes; each of these techniques has its cons and pros. Fourier descriptors, a simple yet powerful technique, has interesting properties such as rotational, scale, and translational invariance and these are powerful features for the recognition of two-dimensional connected shapes. In this paper, we use 380 CXR (Chest X-ray) images as a training set to construct the statistical mean model of lung contour. For modelling, the first step is evaluation of lung contour approximation and characterization to get the good spatial and frequency resolution. In the second step, all of the lung contours registered to show the variation and make a mean shape (i.e. lungs). And the final step is calculating the dispersion (i.e. covariance matrix) and analyzing by principle components. The proposed technique used to create the inter-patient statistical model and provide statistical parameters for application in segmentation, classification, 2D atlas based registration, etc. In this paper, we presented an approach for creating 2D modelling of human lungs from CXR image archives and reported some interesting statistical parameters to analysis the left and the right lung shape.","[Afzali, Ali; Mofrad, Farshid Babapour] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Med Radiat Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Pouladian, Majid] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Biomed Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Pouladian, Majid] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Res Ctr Engn Med & Biol, Tehran, Iran","Mofrad, FB (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Med Radiat Engn, Tehran, Iran.",farshid.mofrad@yahoo.com,"Pouladian, Majid/AAA-2864-2019; Afzali, Ali/AAU-5097-2020; Mofrad, Farshid Babapour/ABH-7935-2020","Pouladian, Majid/0000-0001-6081-6376; Afzali, Ali/0000-0001-9728-0560; Mofrad, Farshid Babapour/0000-0002-5892-7971",,,,40,8,8,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

This cancer occurs due to abnormal tissue growth in the oral cavity. This cancer has limited symptoms, so, it has been difficult to recognize in the early stages. To reduce the death rate of this oral cavity cancer, an automatic system has been developed by applying the optimization techniques in both image processing and machine learning techniques. Even though these methods are successfully recognizing the cancer, the detection accuracy is still one of the major issues because of complex oral tissue structure. So, this paper introduces the Gravitational Search Optimized Echo state neural networks for predicting the oral cancer with effective manner. Initially the X-ray images are collected from the oral cancer database which contains several noises that has to be eliminated with the help of the adaptive wiener filter. Then the affected part has been segmented with the help of the enhanced Markov Stimulated Annealing and the features are derived from segmented region. The derived features are analyzed with the help of the proposed classifier. The excellence of the oral cancer detection system is evaluated using simulation results.","[Al-Ma'aitah, Mohammed; AlZubi, Ahmad Ad] King Saud Univ, Community Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Al-Ma'aitah, M (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Community Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",malmaitah@ksu.edu.sa,"Al-Maitah, Mohammed/AAX-3856-2021; AlZubi, Ahmad Ali/ABB-4190-2020","Al-Maitah, Mohammed/0000-0002-2690-7220; AlZubi, Ahmad Ali/0000-0001-8477-8319",King Saud University [RG-1439-53],The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University for funding this work through research group No. (RG-1439-53).,,21,5,5,2,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The review depends on three reliable search engines: ScienceDirect, Web of Science and IEEE Xplore. A research taxonomy developed for the review considers a wide perspective for automated detection and classification of acute leukaemia research and reflects the usage trends in the evaluation criteria in this field. The developed taxonomy consists of three main research directions in this domain. The taxonomy involves two phases. The first phase includes all three research directions. The second one demonstrates all the criteria used for evaluating acute leukaemia classification. The final set of studies includes 83 investigations, most of which focused on enhancing the accuracy and performance of detection and classification through proposed methods or systems. Few efforts were made to undertake the evaluation issues. According to the final set of articles, three groups of articles represented the main research directions in this domain: 56 articles highlighted the proposed methods, 22 articles involved proposals for system development and 5 papers centred on evaluation and comparison. The other taxonomy side included 16 main and sub-evaluation and benchmarking criteria. This review highlights three serious issues in the evaluation and benchmarking of multiclass classification of acute leukaemia, namely, conflicting criteria, evaluation criteria and criteria importance. It also determines the weakness of benchmarking tools. To solve these issues, multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) analysis techniques were proposed as effective recommended solutions in the methodological aspect. This methodological aspect involves a proposed decision support system based on MCDM for evaluation and benchmarking to select suitable multiclass classification models for acute leukaemia. The said support system is examined and has three sequential phases. Phase One presents the identification procedure and process for establishing a decision matrix based on a crossover of evaluation criteria and acute leukaemia multiclass classification models. Phase Two describes the decision matrix development for the selection of acute leukaemia classification models based on the integrated Best and worst method (BWM) and VIKOR. Phase Three entails the validation of the proposed system.","[Alsalem, M. A.; Zaidan, A. A.; Zaidan, B. B.; Hashim, M.; Albahri, O. S.; Albahri, A. S.; Hadi, Ali; Mohammed, K.

This collective form of monitoring sensor devices forms a very short-range Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) and plays a key role in the data gathering process. If any sensor node in the network detects abnormal values that should be transmitted promptly via wireless medium with less delay. A single medium allows one-way delivery of a data packet, and it may not be sufficient to satisfy the high volume of communication demand between the sensor nodes in the network. In the same way, the packet prioritization does not guarantee the packet will get there on time and sometime it may cause priority conflicts among the nodes. It is only mean that the flow of delivery service handles that critical data packet before handling other data packets. However, unexploited time slots and bandwidth wastage will occur due to inefficient backoff management and collisions. To minimize the aforementioned issues, various backoff procedures, adaptive slot allocation mechanisms, priority-based medium access control protocols have been developed but suffer limitations in the context of providing priority-based channel access with less backoff conflicts and dedicated allocation of time slots for critical nodes in all cases. Based on these deliberations, a more effective Traffic Priority-based Channel Access Technique (TP-CAT) is proposed using IEEE 802.15.6 in order to minimize the transmission delay of critical data packet and solve conflicts among other priority nodes during the backoff phases. Firstly, a Low Threshold Criticality-based Adaptive Time slot Allocation algorithm (LT-CATA) is presented to decrease the priority slot conflicts between the low threshold data traffic from the same and different type of user prioritynodes. Secondly, a High Threshold Criticality-based Adaptive Time slot Allocation algorithm (HT-CATA) is developed to reduce the priority slot conflicts between the high threshold data traffic from the same and different types of user prioritynodes. Additionally, a novel Random Overlapping Backoff value Avoidance (ROBA) technique is introduced to eliminate the overlapping issue during the selection of random backoff value among the sensor nodes. Since, the proposed technique greatly reduced the channel access delay and transmissiondelay of critical data packet as well as other types of priority data packet. The Simulation results are verified in the CASTALIA 3.2 framework using omnet++ network simulater to relatively evaluate the performance metrics of the TP-CAT technique with state-of-the-art protocols. From the analysis of the results, it is evident that the TP-CAT technique provides better performance in terms of delay, energy consumption, and throughput in healthcare monitoring environments.","[Ambigavathi, M.; Sridharan, D.] Anna Univ, Dept ECE, CEG Campus, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India","Ambigavathi, M (corresponding author), Anna Univ, Dept ECE, CEG Campus, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.",ambigaindhu8@gmail.com; sridhar@annauniv.edu,"M, Ambigavathi/O-9062-2018; D, Sridharan/AAQ-7361-2020","M, Ambigavathi/0000-0002-2501-7349; D, Sridharan/0000-0001-7248-7709",University Grant Commission [F1-17.1/2014-15/RGNF-2014-15-SC-TAM-71494],This research work was supported by the National Fellowship grant funded by the University Grant Commission (Grant No. F1-17.1/2014-15/RGNF-2014-15-SC-TAM-71494).

Medical diagnosis relies heavily on Data Mining for automated disease classification and detection. It relies on data mining algorithms to examine medical data. Liver diseases have become more common these days with many new patients being diagnosed with Heptasis B and C. Early diagnosis of Liver Disorder is essential for treatment. It can be achieved by setting up intelligent systems for early diagnose and prognosis of Liver diseases. The existing automated classification systems lack accuracy in results when compared to surgical biopsy. We propose a new hybrid model for liver syndrome classification for analysis of the patient's medical data via hybrid artificial neural network. The medical records are classified based on the possibility of existence of disease. The proposed method uses M-PSO for feature selection of input variables and M-ANN algorithm for disease classification. The presented hybrid approach significantly improves the accuracy compared to existing classification algorithms. The results of the algorithm were examined and evaluated using Spark tool in this work.,"[Anand, L.; Ibrahim, S. P.

One of the reasons for this advancement is the application of machine learning techniques for the analysis of medical images. Deep learning is successfully used as a tool for machine learning, where a neural network is capable of automatically learning features. This is in contrast to those methods where traditionally hand crafted features are used. The selection and calculation of these features is a challenging task. Among deep learning techniques, deep convolutional networks are actively used for the purpose of medical image analysis.

The Haar wavelet is used to segregate the sub bands and threshold operation is carried out in three bands. The wavelet coefficient optimization process is performed for optimizing the coefficient value with the assistance of MBO technique. In this wavelet-optimized parameter, the inverse DWT (IDWT) is applied. The proposed method decreases the noise from images more efficiently.

The number of dry punctate dots occurred on corneal surface after corneal fluorescein staining can be used as a diagnostic indicator of DES severity according to OGS; however, grading of DES severity exactly by carefully assessing these dots is a rather difficult task for humans. Taking into account that current methods are also subjectively dependent on the perception of the ophtalmologists coupled with the time and resource intensive requirements, enhanced diagnosis techniques would greatly contribute to clinical assessment of DES. Automated grading system proposed in this study utilizes image processing methods in order to provide more objective and reliable diagnostic results for DES. A total of 70 fluorescein-stained cornea images from 20 patients with mild, moderate, or severe DES (labeled by an ophthalmologist in the Keratoconus Center of Yildirim Beyazit University Ataturk Training and Research Hospital) used as the participants for the study. Correlations between the number of dry punctate dots and DES severity levels were determined. When automatically created scores and clinical scores were compared, the following measures were observed: Pearson's correlation value between the two was 0.981; Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficients (CCC) was 0.980; and 95% confidence interval limites were 0.963 and 0.989. The automated DES grade was estimated from the regression fit and accordingly the unknown grade is calculated with the following formula: G(pred)=1.3244 log(N-dots) - 0.0612. The study has shown the viability and the utility of a highly successful automated DES diagnostic system based on OGS, which can be developed by working on the fluorescein-stained cornea images. Proper implemention of a computationally savvy and highly accurate classification system, can assist investigators to perform more objective and faster DES diagnoses in real-world scenerios.","[Bagbaba, Ayse; Sen, Baha] Ankara Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Ankara, Turkey; [Delen, Dursun] Oklahoma State Univ, Ctr Hlth Syst Innovat, Spears Sch Business, Dept Management Sci & Informat Syst, Tulsa, OK 74106 USA; [Uysal, Betul Seher] Ataturk Educ & Res Hosp, Ankara, Turkey","Bagbaba, A (corresponding author), Ankara Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Ankara, Turkey.",aysearslan2491@gmail.com,"Delen, Dursun/AAA-2566-2020; Delen, Dursun/AGA-9892-2022; Delen, Dursun/O-6938-2015; ŞEN, BAHA/A-4474-2016","Delen, Dursun/0000-0001-8857-5148; ŞEN, BAHA/0000-0003-3577-2548",,,,51,4,4,1,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In many of these outbreaks, main transmission routes were healthcare facility-associated and through person-to-person contact. While a majority of existing work on modelling of the spread of infectious diseases focuses on transmission processes at a community level, we propose a new methodology to model the outbreaks of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), which must be considered at an individual level. Our work also contributes to a novel aspect of integrating real-time positioning technologies into the tracking and modelling framework for effective HAI outbreak control and prompt responses. Our proposed solution methodology is developed based on three key components - time-varying contact network construction, individual-level transmission tracking and HAI parameter estimation - and aims to identify the hidden health state of each patient and worker within the healthcare facility. We conduct experiments with a four-month human tracking data set collected in a hospital, which bore a big nosocomial outbreak of the 2003 SARS in Hong Kong. The evaluation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing epidemic models for characterizing macro-level phenomena such as the number of infected people and epidemic threshold.","[Cheng, Chun-Hung] Logist & Supply Chain MultiTech R&D Ctr Ltd, Unit 202,Level 2,Block B,Cyberport 4, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kuo, Yong-Hong] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Ziye] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Kuo, YH (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",chcheng@lscm.hk; yhkuo@hku.hk; zhouzy.ustc@gmail.com,"Kuo, Yong-Hong/ABF-8035-2021; Cheng, Chun-Hung/F-6113-2011","Kuo, Yong-Hong/0000-0002-6170-324X; Cheng, Chun Hung/0000-0001-5234-978X","Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong [14201314, 14209416]; RGC GRF [14202115]; Health and Medical Research Fund, Food and Health Bureau, the Hong Kong SAR Government [14151771]","This study was funded by Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong (Project No. 14201314 and 14209416).

We investigate the performance of such system in the communication layer and application layer of internet of things (IOT). Patient monitoring system plays vital role in the hospital particularly in the emergency ward to resolve certain problems such as maintaining glucose level in the body, maintaining minimum sugar levels under emergency conditions. IOT find tremendous application in the hospital to deal with certain issues such as injection of drug to the patients by doctor from remote places, monitoring patients heart beats, sugar level by the concerned doctors. MIMO finds many applications in medical field to enrich data rate while communication patient information at faster rate. We utilize MC-CDMA system to accommodate large user patients information and to transmit such information with high resolution by eliminating channel impairments. We are utilizing Cognitive spectrum for medical image transmission of higher bandwidth applications. We realize Double-space-time transmit diversity as MIMO profile to boost up throughput. We perform multi-carrier modulation using IDFT at the transmitter .we carryout demodulation employing DFT at the hospital. We introduce Multi-carrier communication to fulfil the need of bandwidth efficiency and to diminish frequency selectivity effects.In the application layer, we estimate patient's information with aid of block-nulling decoding algorithm. Moreover we analyze the quality of image of D-STTD MC-CDMA system with turbo style of channel encoder to manifest medical image with high resolution with less signal strength. We conclude that Cognitive D-STTD MC-CDMA system provides reliable communication for the application of IOT and also transfer high resolution medical image with less signal strength in order to observe patient status by doctor.","[Dhevi, B.

The aim of this study was to understand the self-reported perceptions of graduates regarding the influence of an e-Health postgraduate program on their professional careers. In addition, this paper will provide an overview of the e-Health postgraduate program. All graduates from 2005 to 2015 were surveyed using an online questionnaire that consisted of a mixture of closed and open-ended questions. The number of participants in the study was 32. Response rate was 62%. The main motivating factors for studying e-Health were 'relevance to current practice' and 'e-Health is the future'. The participants noted that the opportunity to 'acquiring relevant knowledge' and 'having exposure' were key benefits offered by the e-Health education program. The majority of graduates (n = 23, 72%) thought that the postgraduate e-Health program had an influence on their professional practice. A similar number of participants (n = 23, 72%) mentioned that they had worked in the field of e-Health since their graduation. Their professional roles mainly involved 'implementation of e-Health in health service settings' and the 'use of e-Health in clinical practice'. While e-Health may be steadily integrating into modern health services, e-Health specific job opportunities are still relatively limited. e-Health workforce development must be given priority.","[Edirippulige, Sisira; Smith, Anthony C.; Wickramasinghe, Sumudu] Univ Queensland, Princess Alexandra Hosp, Fac Med, Ctr Online Hlth, Bldg 33, Brisbane, Qld 4102, Australia; [Armfield, Nigel R.] Univ Queensland, Fac Med, Ctr Clin Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Edirippulige, S (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Princess Alexandra Hosp, Fac Med, Ctr Online Hlth, Bldg 33, Brisbane, Qld 4102, Australia.",s.edirippulige@uq.edu.au; asmith@uq.edu.au; sumuduwiekramasinghe@gmail.com; n.r.armfield@uq.edu.au,"Smith, Anthony C./E-9538-2010; Wickramasinghe, Sumudu Indika/I-4868-2019; Armfield, Nigel R./B-4896-2010; edirippulige, sisira/A-7380-2011","Smith, Anthony C./0000-0002-7756-5136; Armfield, Nigel R./0000-0003-4218-0030; edirippulige, sisira/0000-0001-6196-5437",,,,37,4,5,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Cervical cancer classification utilizing gene expression data depends upon conventional supervised learning methods, wherein only labeled data could be used for learning. The previous methodologies had problem with appropriate feature selection as well as accurateness of classification outcomes. So, the entire performance of the cancer classification is decreased meaningfully. With the aim of overcoming the aforesaid problems, Enhanced Bat Optimization Algorithm with Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (EBO-HSIC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is presented in this research for identifying the specific genes from the gene expression dataset that belongs to cancer microarray. This proposed system contains phases of instance normalization, module detection, gene selection and classification. By Fuzzy C Means (FCM) algorithm, the normalization is performed for eliminating the inappropriate features from the gene dataset. Meanwhile, for effective feature selection, the EBO algorithm is used for producing more appropriate features via improved objective function values. For determining a subset of the most informative genes utilizing a rapid as well as scalable bat algorithm, this proposed method focuses on measuring the dependence amid Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) as well as the gene significance. The algorithm is dependent upon the HSIC and was partially enthused by EBO. With the help of SVM classifier, these gene features are categorized very precisely. Experimentation outcomes demonstrate that the presented EBO with SVM algorithm confirms a clear-cut classification performance for the given gene expression datasets. Hence the result provides higher performance by launching EBO with SVM algorithm to obtain greater accuracy, recall, precision, f-measure and less time complexity more willingly than the previous techniques.","[Geeitha, S.] Mahendra Engn Coll Women, Dept Informat Technol, Tiruchengode, India; [Thangamani, M.] Kongu Engn Coll, Dept Comp Sci Engn, Perundurai, India","Geeitha, S (corresponding author), Mahendra Engn Coll Women, Dept Informat Technol, Tiruchengode, India.",geeitha.s@gmail.com,"S, Geeitha/AAY-8898-2021; M, Thangamani/AAL-7755-2020","S, Geeitha/0000-0001-9157-4971; M, Thangamani/0000-0001-8864-3315",,,,48,9,10,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Impulse noise is a common noise caused by malfunctioning of sensor elements or errors in the transmission of images. In medical images due to presence of white foreground and black background, many pixels have intensities similar to impulse noise and hence the distinction between noisy and regular pixels is difficult. Therefore, it is important to design a method to accurately remove this type of noise. In addition to the accuracy, the complexity of the method is very important in terms of hardware implementation. In this paper a low complexity de-noising method is proposed that distinguishes between noisy and non-noisy pixels and removes the noise by local analysis of the image blocks. All steps are designed to have low hardware complexity.

For supervised image analysis in medical imaging, having image data along with their corresponding annotated ground-truths is costly as well as time consuming since annotations of the data is done by medical experts manually. In this paper, we propose a new Generative Adversarial Network for Medical Imaging (MI-GAN).

The dominant texture pattern represents a channel among RGB with maximum variations in the texture and the dominant color pattern represents the color channel with the maximum pixel intensity. The combination of channels with dominant texture pattern and dominant color pattern is assigned a unique value which is used to extract the features of an image.

Nowadays, abdominal surface electrogastrography is the one of methods of stomach examination that is used for diagnosing patients with chronic intractable nausea, vomiting and gastroparesis. The electrogastrographic signals are recorded by using cutaneous electrodes placed on the stomach surface. EGG DWPack system is a highly developed and easy to use software package for four channel electrogastrography recording and analysis. The part of the software for analysis is a MATLAB based software and requires the specific ASCII format of the EGG data. The analyzed EGG signals could be conditioned with the wide range of sampling frequency and various resolutions of analog to digital conversion. Additionally, if the EGG data fulfills certain conditions associated with sampling frequency, the software can be used to study the basic parameters of heart rate variability (HRV) simultaneously with the EGG parameters. The software includes different digital filters for the EGG signal extraction and tools for artifacts exclusion. The software computes the majority of EGG parameters which are commonly used in a clinical practice. The EGG analysis can be made for several adjustable analysis settings and various methods, and it can optimize the analysis methods for different preferences or requirements. The analysis result can be saved in a MAT-file, and exported to MS Excel and ASCII files. Validation of the software was performed using synthetic and real EGG signals. This paper contains, as an example of use, an analysis of four synthetic, and fourteen human 4-channel EGG data recording with water, yogurt and a solid meal stimulation. The mean values of the dominant frequency for fast, and postprandial stage were found to be 2.96 +/- 0.21 cpm (cycle per minute), and 3.05 +/- 0.33 cpm, respectively. The values established in the validation process are consistent with typical human physiological values. In addition, the results were compared to outcomes from commercial system. The results of validation have proved that EGG DWPack software produces reliable outcomes. The software is available for free of charge for Windows operating system for the all possible non commercial use.","[Komorowski, Dariusz] Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Biomed Engn, Dept Biosensors & Proc Biomed Signals, Zabrze, Poland","Komorowski, D (corresponding author), Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Biomed Engn, Dept Biosensors & Proc Biomed Signals, Zabrze, Poland.",dariusz.komorowski@polsl.pl,"Komorowski, Dariusz/Q-3461-2018","Komorowski, Dariusz/0000-0003-4430-6047",,,,48,4,4,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In other instances, they have also shown lack of interoperability, functionality and many medical errors. With proper implementation and training, are electronic health records a viable source in managing population health? The primary objective of this systematic review is to assess the relationship of electronic health records' use on population health through the identification and analysis of facilitators and barriers to its adoption for this purpose. Authors searched Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and MEDLINE (PubMed), 10/02/2012-10/02/2017, core clinical/academic journals, MEDLINE full text, English only, human species and evaluated the articles that were germane to our research objective. Each article was analyzed by multiple reviewers. Group members recognized common facilitators and barriers associated with EHRs effect on population health. A final list of articles was selected by the group after three consensus meetings (n = 55). Among a total of 26 factors identified, 63% (147/232) of those were facilitators and 37% (85/232) barriers. About 70% of the facilitators consisted of productivity/efficiency in EHRs occurring 33 times, increased quality and data management each occurring 19 times, surveillance occurring 17 times, and preventative care occurring 15 times. About 70% of the barriers consisted of missing data occurring 24 times, no standards (interoperability) occurring 13 times, productivity loss occurring 12 times, and technology too complex occurring 10 times. The analysis identified more facilitators than barriers to the use of the EHR to support public health. Wider adoption of the EHR and more comprehensive standards for interoperability will only enhance the ability for the EHR to support this important area of surveillance and disease prevention. This review identifies more facilitators than barriers to using the EHR to support public health, which implies a certain level of usability and acceptance to use the EHR in this manner. The public-health industry should combine their efforts with the interoperability projects to make the EHR both fully adopted and fully interoperable. This will greatly increase the availability, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of data across the country, which will enhance benchmarking and disease surveillance/prevention capabilities.","[Kruse, Clemens Scott; Stein, Anna; Thomas, Heather; Kaur, Harmander] Texas State Univ, 601 Univ Dr,Encino 250, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA","Kruse, CS (corresponding author), Texas State Univ, 601 Univ Dr,Encino 250, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA.",scottkruse@txstate.edu,"Kruse, Clemens Scott/K-6243-2014","Kruse, Clemens Scott/0000-0002-7636-1086",,,,70,70,74,2,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The region of interest (foreground) and background are separated initially by region growing algorithm. The region of interest is encoded with low compression ratio and high bit rate; the background region is encoded with high compression ratio and low bit rate. The codebook generated from foreground and background is merged, optimized by simulated annealing algorithm. The performance of CVQ-SA algorithm was validated in terms of metrics like Peak to Signal Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Square Error (MSE) and Compression Ratio (CR), the result was superior when compared with classical VQ, CVQ, JPEG lossless and JPEG lossy algorithms. The algorithms are developed in Matlab 2010a and tested on real-time abdomen CT datasets. The quality of reconstructed image was also validated by metrics like Structural Content (SC), Normalized Absolute Error (NAE), Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) and statistical analysis was performed by Mann Whitney U Test.

The NHI-PharmaCloud can help pharmacists access patient medication information from the preceding 3months to improve drug safety. The use of NHI-PharmaCloud can improve the quality of healthcare, but improvements cannot occur if pharmacists are unwilling to use the platform. Therefore, the main objective of our study is to investigate the factors affecting pharmacists' adoption of the NHI-PharmaCloud. This study develops a research model using theories of technology adoption, self-efficacy, and perceived risk and uses randomly distributed survey questionnaires to collect data from local pharmacists. The results show that self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and perceived psychological risk are 3 critical factors that could affect pharmacists' willingness to use the NHI-PharmaCloud. The research results may also help NHIA to effectively promote the usage of the NHI-PharmaCloud in Taiwan.

Yet compliance could still be improved and therefore building on the MobiGuide project experience, we designed a new component called the Motivational Patient Assistant (MPA) that is integrated within the MobiGuide architecture to further improve compliance. This component draws from psychological theories to provide behavioral support to improve patient engagement and thereby increasing patients' compliance. Behavior modification interventions are delivered via mobile technology at patients' home environments. Our approach was inspired by the IDEAS (Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share) framework for developing effective digital interventions to change health behavior; it goes beyond this approach by extending the Ideation phase' concepts into concrete backend architectural components and graphical user-interface designs that implement behavioral interventions. We describe in detail our ideation approach and how it was applied to design the user interface of MPA for anticoagulation therapy for the atrial fibrillation patients.

This AD disease has less symptoms such as short term memory loss, mood swings, problem with language understanding and behavioral issues. Due to these low symptoms, AD disease is difficult to recognize in the early stage. So, the automated computer aided system need to be developed for recognizing the AD disease for minimizing the mortality rate. Initially, brain MRI image is collected from patients which are processed by applying different processing steps such as noise removal, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. The captured MRI image has noise that is eliminated by applying the Lucy-Richardson approach which examines the each pixel in the image and removes the Gaussian noise which also eliminates the blur image. After eliminating the noise pixel from the image, affected region is segmented by Prolong adaptive exclusive analytical Atlas approach. From the segmented region, different GLCM statistical features are extracted and optimal features subset is selected by applying the hybrid wrapper filtering approach. This selected features are analyzed by N-fold cross validation approach which recognizes the AD related features successfully. Then the efficiency of the system is evaluated with the help of MATLAB based experimental results, in which Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset images are utilized for examining the efficiency in terms of sensitivity, specificity, ROC curve and accuracy.","[Sampath, R.] Anna Univ, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Indumathi, J.] Anna Univ, Dept Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Engn, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India","Sampath, R (corresponding author), Anna Univ, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.",sampathrajaram14@gmail.com,"JAYARAMAN, INDUMATHI/AFQ-7588-2022","JAYARAMAN, INDUMATHI/0000-0003-4673-6710; RAJARAM, SAMPATH/0000-0001-9806-3912",,,,26,7,7,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

It is used clinically to determine the indication for several therapeutic interventions. LVEF is most commonly derived using in-line tools and some manual assessment by cardiologists from standardized echocardiographic views. LVEF is typically documented in free-text reports, and variation in LVEF documentation pose a challenge for the extraction and utilization of LVEF in computer-based clinical workflows. To address this problem, we developed a computerized algorithm to extract LVEF from echocardiography reports for the identification of patients having heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) for therapeutic intervention at a large healthcare system. We processed echocardiogram reports for 57,158 patients with coded diagnosis of Heart Failure that visited the healthcare system over a two-year period. Our algorithm identified a total of 3910 patients with reduced ejection fraction. Of the 46,634 echocardiography reports processed, 97% included a mention of LVEF. Of these reports, 85% contained numerical ejection fraction values, 9% contained ranges, and the remaining 6% contained qualitative descriptions. Overall, 18% of extracted numerical LVEFs were40%. Furthermore, manual validation for a sample of 339 reports yielded an accuracy of 1.0. Our study demonstrates that a regular expression-based approach can accurately extract LVEF from echocardiograms, and is useful for delineating heart-failure patients with reduced ejection fraction.","[Wagholikar, Kavishwar B.; MacRae, Calum A.; Scirica, Benjamin M.; Desai, Akshay S.; Murphy, Shawn N.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wagholikar, Kavishwar B.; Fischer, Christina M.; Murphy, Shawn N.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Goodson, Alyssa; Herrick, Christopher D.; Rees, Martin; Toscano, Eloy; Murphy, Shawn N.] Partners Healthcare, Boston, MA USA; [MacRae, Calum A.; Scirica, Benjamin M.; Desai, Akshay S.] Brigham Womens Hosp, Boston, MA USA","Wagholikar, KB (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Wagholikar, KB (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",waghsk@gmail.com,"Wagholikar, Kavishwar/M-1249-2013; Desai, Akshay/ABE-7250-2020","Wagholikar, Kavishwar/0000-0002-6219-861X; ",National Human Genome Research Institute (US) [R01-HG009174] Funding Source: Medline; NLM NIH HHS [R00 LM011575] Funding Source: Medline; U.S. National Library of Medicine (US) [R00-LM011575] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE [R01HG009174] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE [R00LM011575] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,,,27,10,10,1,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Residents care for patients under the supervision of the attending physician, whereas scribes assist physicians with documentation contemporaneously with the patient encounter. Optimal allocation of these roles to shifts is crucial to improve patient care, physician productivity, and to increase learning opportunities for residents. Since resident and scribe availability varies on a monthly basis, the allocation of these roles into different shifts within a pre-designed ED physician shift template must be dynamically adjusted. Using historical patient flow timestamp data as well as information about the patient-coverage capacity of an ED care team, a data-driven model was developed for optimally determining which shifts must be staffed by residents and scribes to maximize patient coverage and to calculate the relative importance of a shift. This relative importance metric aids decision-making in adjusting the allocation of residents and scribes to various shifts as their availability fluctuates. Since the model uses historical timestamp data, which all EDs are mandated to collect, the approach is generalizable to all EDs.","[Wutthisirisart, Phichet; Pasupathy, Kalyan; Sir, Mustafa Y.] Mayo Clin, Dept Hlth Sci Res, Kern Ctr Sci Hlth Care Delivery, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Martinez, Gabriela] Siemens Healthineers, Manhasset, NY USA; [Heaton, Heather A.] Mayo Clin, Dept Emergency Med, Rochester, MN USA; [Thompson, Moriah S.] Univ Texas Med Branch, Aerosp Med, Galveston, TX 77555 USA","Sir, MY (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Dept Hlth Sci Res, Kern Ctr Sci Hlth Care Delivery, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.",sir.mustafa@mayo.edu,,"Martinez, Maria/0000-0003-4919-0733",Mayo Clinic Robert D. and Patricia E.

In a TMIS, patients upload their medical data through smart devices to obtain a doctor's diagnosis. However, these smart devices have limited computing and storage capacities, so it is difficult to store substantial patient information and to support time-consuming operations. Moreover, although many three-factor authentication protocols have been proposed for TMISs, the problems of privacy leaks and other security flaws are serious. In addition, authentication factors are verified at the user side in most protocols, giving users a high level of trust and resulting in a potential lack of security. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient truly three-factor authentication protocol for TMISs. In our proposed protocol, three factors (i.e., password, smart card and biometrics) are verified at the server side, which reduces the storage and computational burden of the user side. Additionally, our proposed protocol uses only lightweight operators and is thus efficient. A formal proof analysis demonstrates that our proposed protocol is provably secure in the random oracle model. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed protocol is very efficient and suitable for TMISs.","[Xu, Dongqing; Chen, Jianhua; Zhang, Shu] Wuhan Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qin] Wuhan Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Key Lab Aerosp Informat Secur & Trusted Comp, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China","Liu, Q (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Key Lab Aerosp Informat Secur & Trusted Comp, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",qinliu@whu.edu.cn,,"Liu, Qin/0000-0002-8979-5094","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61572370, 61501333, 61572379]","The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61572370, 61501333 and 61572379.",,33,8,8,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The pattern of bacterial growth graph was analyzed in two steps: the signal stage recorded using the monitoring data until positive signal and the post-signal stage recorded using one additional hour of monitoring data gained after the positive signal. The growth graph before the positive signal consists of three periods; initial decline period, stable period, and steeping period. Signal stage analyzed initial decline period and stable period, and classified the graphs as standard, increasing, decreasing, irregular, or defective pattern, respectively. Then, all patterns were re-assigned as confirmed or suspicious pattern in the post-signal stage. Standard, increasing, and decreasing patterns with both initial decline period and stable period are typical patterns; irregular patterns lacking a smooth stable period and defective patterns without an initial decline period are false positive patterns. The false positive patterns have 77.2% of PPV for FPS. The confirmed patterns, showing a gradually increasing fluorescence level even after positive signal, have 97.0% of PPV for TPS.","[Ahn, Kwangjin; Kim, Juwon; Lee, Jong-Han; Hwang, Gyu Yel; Yoo, Gilsung; Yoon, Kap Jun; Uh, Young] Yonsei Univ, Wonju Coll Med, Dept Lab Med, Wonju, South Korea; [Ahn, Jae-Hyeong] Chungbuk Natl Univ, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Cheongju, South Korea","Uh, Y (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Wonju Coll Med, Dept Lab Med, Wonju, South Korea.",u931018@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,22,0,0,3,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Quaternion is used to represent differences of two pixels. The pixels are sorted and assigned a rank based on the aggregated sum of pixel differences with other pixels inside the filtering window. The central pixel is considered as corrupted by an impulse if its rank is bigger than a predefined rank and the minimum difference between it and other pixels in the four edge direction inside the window is larger than a predefined threshold. The noisy pixel is replaced by output of vector median filter implemented using quaternion. For color images, both intensity and chromaticity components are used. Quaternion processes color images as single unit rather than as separated color channels. This preserves the correlation and three dimensional vector natures of the color channels. For grayscale medical images, the same algorithm is implemented by using the intensity difference between two pixels. Experimental results show improved performance of the proposed filter in suppressing the impulse noise while retaining the original image details comparing against other well-known filters.","[Chanu, P.

In the field of cognitive science, neuroscience and physiological research, Electroencephalogram (EEG) is extensively utilized. The primary tasks of EEG signal analysis is to identify the noisy signal as well as enormous data that create signal processing and subsequent analysis. Beforehand any analysis of the EEG signal, the obtained raw signal must be preprocessed for eliminating undesirable artifacts as well as horrible noise. With the aim of resolving this issue, in this research, raw signals are preprocessed with the help of Band-Pass Filter (BPF) for noise removal method. Instead, in adaptive Sliding Window with Fuzzy C Means Clustering (SW-FCM) segmentation is presented, which precisely as well as automatically segments the signals. So as to analyze the accuracy, five features such as electroencephalography alpha spectrum, frequency of the main peak, Amplitude of the main peak, Higher Order Crossing (HOC), and wavelet features are used as the evaluating variables. Lastly to assess the meditation experience with Fuzzy Kernel least square Support Vector Machine (FKLSSVM) classifier, the presented method with a cross-sectional analysis is utilized. These two classifiers are utilized for meditation experience classification by utilizing an individual feature vector values from equivalent EEG signals. The dataset samples are gathered from Open source Brain-Computer Interface (Open BCI) platform. Outcomes attained are matched up for diverse techniques for identifying as well as for classifying signal segments features using MATLAB. Presented classifiers of the meditation process validate quick interpretation methods that differentiate meditation experience and valuable performance related to artificial approaches for the big-data analysis.","[Devipriya, A.] Sri Krishna Coll Engn & Technol, Informat Technol, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Nagarajan, N.] Coimbatore Inst Engn & Technol, Narasipuram, India","Devipriya, A (corresponding author), Sri Krishna Coll Engn & Technol, Informat Technol, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.",adevipriya@skcet.ac.in; swekalnag@gmail.com,,,,,,43,2,2,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Automated calculation of the SOFA score using existing electronic health record data would broaden its applicability. We performed a manual validation of an automated SOFA score previously developed at our institution. A retrospective analysis of a random subset of 300 patients from a previously published randomized trial of critically ill adults was performed, with manual validation of SOFA scores from the date of initial intensive care unit admission. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, weighted Cohen's kappa, and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess agreement between manual and electronic versions of SOFA scores and between manual and electronic versions of their individual components. There was high agreement between manual and electronic SOFA scores (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient=0.90, 95% CI 0.87-0.93). Renal and respiratory components had lower agreement (weighted Cohen's kappa=0.63, 95% CI 0.53-0.73 for renal; weighted Cohen's kappa=0.77, 95% CI 0.70-0.84 for respiratory). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for 30-day in-hospital mortality was 0.77 (95% CI 0.68-0.84) for manual SOFA scores and 0.75 (95% CI 0.66-0.83) for automated SOFA scores. Automatic calculation of SOFA scores from the electronic health record is feasible and correlates highly with manually calculated SOFA scores. Both have similar predictive value for 30-day in-hospital mortality.","[Huerta, Luis E.; Rice, Todd W.; Semler, Matthew W.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Allergy Pulm & Crit Care Med, 1161 21st Ave S,T-1218 MCN, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Wanderer, Jonathan P.; Ehrenfeld, Jesse M.; Freundlich, Robert E.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol, 1161 21st Ave S,T-1218 MCN, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Wanderer, Jonathan P.; Ehrenfeld, Jesse M.; Freundlich, Robert E.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biomed Informat, 1161 21st Ave S,T-1218 MCN, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Ehrenfeld, Jesse M.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Surg, 1161 21st Ave S,T-1218 MCN, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Ehrenfeld, Jesse M.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Hlth Policy, 1161 21st Ave S,T-1218 MCN, Nashville, TN 37232 USA","Huerta, LE (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Allergy Pulm & Crit Care Med, 1161 21st Ave S,T-1218 MCN, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.",luis.e.huerta@vumc.org,"Ehrenfeld, Jesse/AAI-2951-2020; Rice, Todd/X-7853-2019","Huerta, Luis/0000-0002-4343-9510; Wanderer, Jonathan/0000-0002-3119-6873; Freundlich, Robert/0000-0002-0343-9823","NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES [UL1TR000445, KL2TR002245, UL1TR002243] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE [K12HL133117] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES [T32AI095202] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [5T32AI095202] Funding Source: Medline; NCATS NIH HHS [UL1 TR002243, KL2 TR002245, UL1 TR000445] Funding Source: Medline; NHLBI NIH HHS [K12 HL133117, K12HL133117, T32 HL087738] Funding Source: Medline; NIAID NIH HHS [T32 AI095202] Funding Source: Medline; NIH HHS [R34HL105869] Funding Source: Medline; Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research [UL1TR000445, UL1TR002243] Funding Source: Medline; School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University [KL2TR002245] Funding Source: Medline",,,24,9,10,2,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Earlier identification of patients who are at higher risk for PVL may improve clinicians' ability to optimize care for these challenging patients. The aim of this study was to apply machine learning algorithms and wavelet analysis to vital sign and laboratory data obtained from neonates immediately after cardiac surgery to predict PVL occurrence. We analyzed physiological data of patients with and without hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) during the first 12 h after cardiac surgery. Wavelet transform was applied to extract time-frequency information from the data. We ranked the extracted features to select the most discriminative features, and the support vector machine with radial basis function as a kernel was selected as the classifier. The classifier was optimized via three methods: (1) mutual information, (2) modified mutual information considering the reliability of features, and (3) modified mutual information with reliability index and maximizing set's mutual information. We assessed the accuracy of the classifier at each time point. A total of 71 neonates met the study criteria. The rates of PVL occurrence were 33% for all patients, with 41% in the HLHS group and 25% in the non-HLHS group. The F-score results for HLHS patients and non-HLHS patients were 0.88 and 1.00, respectively. Using maximizing set's mutual information improved the classifier performance in the all patient groups from 0.69 to 0.81. The novel application of a modified mutual information ranking system with the reliability index in a PVL prediction model provided highly accurate identification. This tool is a promising step for improving the care of neonates who are at higher risk for developing PVL following cardiac surgery.","[Jalali, Ali] Johns Hopkins All Childrens Hosp, Dept Hlth Informat, 501 6th Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Simpao, Allan F.; Galvez, Jorge A.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care, 3401 Civ Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Simpao, Allan F.; Galvez, Jorge A.; Licht, Daniel J.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, 3401 Civ Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Licht, Daniel J.] Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Dept Pediat, 3401 Civ Ctr Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Nataraj, Chandrasekhar] Villanova Univ, Villanova Ctr Analyt Dynam Syst, Dept Mech Engn, Villanova, PA 19085 USA","Jalali, A (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins All Childrens Hosp, Dept Hlth Informat, 501 6th Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.",jalali@jhmi.edu,"Gálvez, Jorge/U-3448-2018; Simpao, Allan F./V-6946-2018; Licht, Daniel/I-3370-2013","Gálvez, Jorge/0000-0001-7145-4921; Simpao, Allan F./0000-0001-8871-2579; Licht, Daniel/0000-0002-4080-843X",National Institutes of Health [1 R01 NS 72338 01A1],The research reported in this paper was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (No. 1 R01 NS 72338 01A1).,,30,10,10,1,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

This will have a major influence on both the patient and the society as it can normally influence the humans in their gainful years. An early DR detection is quite challenging as it may not be detected by humans. There are several techniques and algorithms that have been established for detecting the DR. These techniques have been facing problems to achieve effective sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity. In order to overcome all these problems, the work has proposed one more such effective algorithm for image processing in order to increase the efficiency and also identify easily the DR diseases. A major challenge in the task is the automatic detection of the microaneurysms. In this work, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) parameters optimized with Glowworm Swarm Optimization (GSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to classify the DR. Because the SVM parameter C and to control the performance of the classifier. For this work, the SVMs get fused with the hybrid GSO-GA along with the feature chromosomes that are generated that will thereby direct the GA search to a straight line of the error of optimal generalization in their super parameter space. This GSO algorithm will not have memory and the glow worms will not retain any information in memory. The results of the experiment prove that this method had achieved a better performance.","[Karthikeyan, R.] PSNA Coll Engn & Technol, Dept CSE, Dindigul, Tamil Nadu, India; [Alli, P.] Velammal Coll Engn & Technol, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India","Karthikeyan, R (corresponding author), PSNA Coll Engn & Technol, Dept CSE, Dindigul, Tamil Nadu, India.",rkarthikeyan.csc@gmail.com; alli_rajus@yahoo.com,"P, Alli/AFJ-7184-2022; R, Karthikeyan/AAR-8093-2020","P, Alli/0000-0001-6131-6250; R, Karthikeyan/0000-0003-1264-5554",,,,24,13,13,0,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

We propose a fully-reconfigurable architecture that addresses the major challenges of a heterogenous BSN, such as scalabiliy, modularity and flexibility in deployment. Existing BSNs especially with Electroencephalogarm (EEG) have these limitations mainly due to the use of driven-right-leg (DRL) circuit. We address these limitations by custom-designing DRL-less EEG smart sensing nodes (SSN) for modular and spatially distributed systems. Each single-channel EEG SSN with a input-referred noise of 0.82 V-rms and CMRR of 70dB (at 60Hz), samples brain signals at 512 sps. SSNs in the network can be configured at the time of deployment and can process information locally to significantly reduce data payload of the network. A Control Command Node (CCN) initializes, synchronizes, periodically scans for the available SSNs in the network, aggregates their data and sends it wirelessly to a paired device at a baud rate of 115.2kbps. At the given settings of the (IC)-C-2 bus speed of 100kbps, CCN can configure up to 39 EEG SSNs in a lego-like platform. The temporal and frequency-domain performance of the designed DRL-less EEG SSNs is evaluated against a research-grade Neuroscan and consumer-grade Emotiv EPOC EEG. The results show that the proposed network system with wearable EEG can be deployed in situ for continuous brain signal recording in real-life scenarios. The proposed system can also seamlessly incorporate other physiological SSNs for ECG, HRV, temperature etc. along with EEG within the same topology.","[Mahajan, Ruhi] Univ Tennessee, Hlth Sci Ctr, Ctr Biomed Informat, Memphis, TN 38163 USA; [Morshed, Bashir I.] Univ Memphis, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; [Bidelman, Gavin M.] Univ Memphis, Sch Commun Sci & Disorders, Memphis, TN 38152 USA","Mahajan, R (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Hlth Sci Ctr, Ctr Biomed Informat, Memphis, TN 38163 USA.",er.ruhimahajan@gmail.com,"Bidelman, Gavin M/D-9998-2016","Bidelman, Gavin M/0000-0002-1821-3261","FedEx Institute of Technology Innovation Grant, The University of Memphis, TN [2013-537908] Funding Source: Medline",,,36,0,0,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

But recently, this disease has been witnessed in other regions to a large extent and can become an epidemic very soon. In this paper, a new fog computing based e-Healthcare framework has been proposed to monitor the KFD infected patients in an early phase of infection and control the disease outbreak. For ensuring high prediction rate, a novel Extremal Optimization tuned Neural Network (EO-NN) classification algorithm has been developed using hybridization of the extremal optimization with the feed-forward neural network. Additionally, a location based alert system has also been suggested to provide the global positioning system (GPS)-based location information of each KFD infected user and the risk-prone zones as early as possible to prevent the outbreak. Furthermore, a comparative study of proposed EO-NN with state of art classification algorithms has been carried out and it can be concluded that EO-NN outperforms others with an average accuracy of 91.56%, a sensitivity of 91.53% and a specificity of 97.13% respectively in classification and accurate identification of risk-prone areas.","[Majumdar, Abhishek; Baishnab, Krishna Lal] Natl Inst Technol Silchar, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Silchar, India; [Debnath, Tapas] Natl Inst Technol Silchar, Dept Mech Engn, Silchar, India; [Sood, Sandeep K.] Guru Nanak Dev Univ, Reg Campus, Gurdaspur, India","Majumdar, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol Silchar, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Silchar, India.",abhishek.nits@ieee.org,"Majumdar, Abhishek/A-6614-2019; Debnath, Tapas/O-8825-2018","Debnath, Tapas/0000-0003-1520-4818; Majumdar, Abhishek/0000-0003-0503-2821; K.

A notification issued in July 2015 in South Korea recommended caution while prescribing tricyclic antidepressants to the elderly. Further, since October 2015, the nationwide computerized drug utilization review monitoring system provides a pop-up window, on a real-time basis, whenever tricyclic antidepressants are prescribed to elderly outpatients. Therefore, we evaluated whether providing drug utilization review information was effective in reducing tricyclic antidepressant prescription to elderly outpatients. We used the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service-Adult Patient Sample data from 2014 to 2016. Data related to the prescription of tricyclic antidepressants to outpatients aged 65years or more were extracted. We determined the number of prescriptions per day per 100,000 elderly patients in each month, compared the average number of prescriptions before and after the drug utilization review information was provided, and evaluated the changes in the number of prescriptions by using an interrupted time series analysis. The average number of tricyclic antidepressant prescriptions per day per 100,000 elderly patients decreased from 76.6 (75.5 to 77.6) to 65.7 (64.5 to 66.9), a 14.2% reduction after the provision of drug utilization review information started. Following initiation of provision of drug utilization review information, there was an immediate drop of 9.2 tricyclic antidepressant prescriptions per day per 100,000 elderly patients, whereas there was no statistically significant change in trends. Providing the drug utilization review information on tricyclic antidepressant prescription for the elderly contributed to the reduction in tricyclic antidepressant prescriptions.","[Park, Mi-Ju; Kim, Mi-Hee; Shin, Sun Mi; Chung, Soo Youn] Korea Inst Drug Safety & Risk Management, 30 Burim Ro,169Beon Gil, Anyang Si, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea","Shin, SM (corresponding author), Korea Inst Drug Safety & Risk Management, 30 Burim Ro,169Beon Gil, Anyang Si, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",hapyday01@drugsafe.or.kr; miheekim@drugsafe.or.kr; smshin@drugsafe.or.kr; sooyoun@drugsafe.or.kr,,,,,,38,4,4,1,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

However, the usability of these applications does not appear to be the focus of development because users with autism can have difficulty with fine motor skills. This article focuses on evaluating the optimal drag distance and the sizes of the interaction elements for users with Autism Spectrum Disorder. To accomplish this goal, a case study was conducted that involved 20 users with Autism Spectrum Disorder and 30 users with typical development, using a prototype generated and two applications for commercial use on 7-in. tablets. For both developed applications, a slight variation can be observed between the different groups of participants. In the interaction with Proyect@ Habilidades, the application has pictograms of 65 pixels and it has a maximum trailing distance of 340 pixels. Moreover, in Proyect@ Retratos, where there is a minimum deviation between users with levels of autism 1 and 2, it also has pictograms of 65 pixels but with a drag distance of 110 pixels. For this reason, according to the results, we suggest that in order to obtain better results in the interaction with applications aimed at users diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders, the applications should have pictograms of a range of 65 pixels with a drag interaction between 110 and 340 pixels.

This new notation is an adaptation of BPMNE2, an extension of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), which allows direct modelling of procedures that follow the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) model. The new notation has been validated in the hospital context, specifically in the field of hazardous drugs (HDs). To measure usability from the perspective of the health staff and auditors, the System Usability Scale (SUS) was used. A total of 47 experts took part in the assessment, resulting in a SUS score of 71, that corresponds to an acceptable level of usability. The feedback provided by these participants allows us to discover benefits and drawbacks of the proposal. Also, it is noteworthy that 76.6% of professionals prefer to migrate to the new notation from the ISO 5807:1985 notation, the most commonly used model. In addition to the direct benefits of this notation from the human point of view, its machine-understandable nature provides the required support for its integration into software tools for intelligent monitoring and auditing.","[Ramos-Merino, Mateo; Alvarez-Sabucedo, Luis M.; Santos-Gago, Juan M.] Univ Vigo, Escola Enxenaria Telecomunicac, Campus Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36310, Galicia, Spain; [Sanz-Valero, Javier] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Salud Publ Hist Ciencia & Ginecol, Campus St Joan, Alicante 03550, Spain","Ramos-Merino, M (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Escola Enxenaria Telecomunicac, Campus Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36310, Galicia, Spain.",mateo.ramos@gist.uvigo.es,"Gago, Juan Manuel Santos/ABG-9718-2020; Ramos Merino, Mateo/D-3749-2018","Gago, Juan Manuel Santos/0000-0002-2930-4249; Ramos Merino, Mateo/0000-0003-2460-0441; Alvarez Sabucedo, Luis/0000-0002-5834-7045",Instituto de Salud Carlos III [PI16/00788],This work has been partially funded by Instituto de Salud Carlos III through the PI16/00788 project (Quality control and traceability of biohazardous medicinal products (BPM) through the Hospital at Home using Big Data models applied to risk analysis).,,33,11,13,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

It can eventually lead to vision loss. The early detection of DR prevents the cause of blindness. In this paper, we propose the retinal image segmentation and extraction of blood vessels by morphological processing, thresholding, edge detection, and adaptive histogram equalization. For the automatic diagnosis of DR from the fundus image, we also developed a network with the convolutional neural network architecture for accurately classifying its severity.

A medical centre server is a remote computer that enables hospitals and physicians to analyse data in real time and offer appropriate services to patients. The server can also manage, organise and support professionals in telemedicine. Therefore, a remote medical centre server plays a crucial role in sustainably delivering quality healthcare services in telemedicine. This article presents a comprehensive review of the provision of healthcare services in telemedicine applications, especially in the medical centre server. Moreover, it highlights the open issues and challenges related to providing healthcare services in the medical centre server within telemedicine. Methodological aspects to control and manage the process of healthcare service provision and three distinct and successive phases are presented. The first phase presents the identification process to propose a decision matrix (DM) on the basis of a crossover of 'multi-healthcare services' and 'hospital list' within intelligent data and service management centre (Tier 4). The second phase discusses the development of a DM for hospital selection on the basis of integrated VIKOR-Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods. Finally, the last phase examines the validation process for the proposed framework.","[Albahri, O. S.; Zaidan, A. A.; Zaidan, B. B.; Hashim, M.; Albahri, A. S.; Alsalem, M.

The goal was to establish standardized terms to measure and assess the performance of operating room and procedural areas. By incorporating standardized concepts of efficiency and utilization, the PTG codified operating room metrics and facilitated benchmarking and quality improvement initiatives. In the last three decades, these concepts have also served as the basis for research in operating room management, including incorporating frameworks from diverse fields. The metrics in the PTG are divided into four categories: (1) Procedural Times; (2) Procedural and Scheduling Definitions and Time Periods; (3) Utilization and Efficiency Indices; and (4) Patient Categories. We describe each of the categories and corresponding metrics. The PTG provides the fundamental building blocks for managing operating and non-operating room suites. We hope that reintroducing these important time markers will help facilitate the reporting of standardized metrics.","[Boggs, Steven D.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Anesthesiol, Med Ctr, Memphis, TN USA; [Tsai, Mitchell H.] Univ Vermont, Larner Coll Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Burlington, VT USA; [Tsai, Mitchell H.] Univ Vermont, Dept Orthoped & Rehabil Courtesy, Larner Coll Med, Burlington, VT USA; [Tsai, Mitchell H.] Univ Vermont, Larner Coll Med, Dept Surg Courtesy, Burlington, VT USA; [Urman, Richard D.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Urman, Richard D.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Perioperat Res, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Urman, RD (corresponding author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Urman, RD (corresponding author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ctr Perioperat Res, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",rurman@bwh.harvard.edu,"Boggs, Steven/AAS-7578-2021; Urman, Richard/ABG-4830-2020; Urman, Richard/AAH-7758-2019","Urman, Richard/0000-0002-0516-5977; Boggs, Steven/0000-0003-2713-7616",,,,28,16,16,1,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

It is generally accepted that it must be positioned on electrically neutral tissues, such as tendons or bony prominences. The objective of this study is to analyze the characteristics of the electromyographic signal (EMG) for different positions of RE as well as at different levels of muscle contraction. Signals from the brachial biceps and triceps were recorded from 18 healthy women (BMI: 21.20 kg/m(2) +/- 1.72; mean age: 21.94 +/- 1.98 years old) during 100 and 50% maximum flexion voluntary isometric contractions, as well as at rest. For each situation, the RE was randomly positioned in 4 different locations: a) homolateral acromion; b) homolateral brachial biceps; c) styloid process of the contralateral ulna; and d) lateral malleolus of the contralateral ankle. For statistical analysis, Shapiro-Wilk and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used, followed by Dunn's post-hoc test, at a significance level of 5% (p < 0.05). RMS, normalized RMS, PSD, median frequency and levels of energy at 60 Hz, 120 Hz and 180 Hz were assessed for the different sites of RE. The results show that the positioning of the RE on the four experimental locations did not change important features of the electromyographic signals in the time and frequency domains, for the three levels of isometric contractions studied. Such findings compel us to re-think the current trend regarding the RE position followed by the great majority of the researches in areas such as physical therapy.","[de Jesus Guirro, Rinaldo Roberto; Simieli, Camila; Peres Boratino, Alessandra Vairo; de Carvalho, Gabriela; Gobbi, Aline; de Oliveira Guirro, Elaine Caldeira] Univ Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto Med Sch, Dept Hlth Sience, Ave Bandeirantes 3900, BR-3900 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Soares, Alcimar Barbosa; Guirro, Amanda Caldeira] Univ Fed Uberlandia, Lab Biomed Engn, Fac Elect Engn, Uberlandia, MG, Brazil","Guirro, ECD (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto Med Sch, Dept Hlth Sience, Ave Bandeirantes 3900, BR-3900 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",ecguirro@fmrp.usp.br,"Guirro, Elaine CO/C-3107-2015; Guirro, Rinaldo R J/B-5134-2013; Soares, Alcimar Barbosa/G-3269-2012","Guirro, Rinaldo R J/0000-0001-7491-3388; Soares, Alcimar Barbosa/0000-0003-1100-3533; de Carvalho, Gabriela/0000-0002-6237-6308",National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); Scientific Scholarship Initiation Program of the University of Sao Paulo,Financial support by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) as well as the Scientific Scholarship Initiation Program of the University of Sao Paulo.,,14,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

However, there is uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of strategies to improve start time, and questions regarding the barriers to their implementation. We conducted a systematic review of bibliographic databases to identify primary research papers assessing the effect of interventions on theatre start time. Two hundred and nine papers were found from electronic literature search with 14 being included in the final review. Financial incentives, educational approaches, system-based techniques, communication, the 'golden patient' initiative and 'the productive operating theatre' scheme have all been shown to improve start time. However, questions remain over which is the most effective, the longevity of their effects and whether the results can be extrapolated beyond the context in which they were studied. We summarise the key approaches reported in the literature and identify areas for future research.

However, the analysis of human emotions upon exposure to music considered as important direction. Although distributed in various academic databases, research on this concept is limited. To extend research in this area, the researchers explored and analysed the academic articles published within the mentioned scope. Thus, in this paper a systematic review is carried out to map and draw the research scenery for EEG human emotion into a taxonomy. Systematically searched all articles about the, EEG human emotion based music in three main databases: ScienceDirect, Web of Science and IEEE Xplore from 1999 to 2016. These databases feature academic studies that used EEG to measure brain signals, with a focus on the effects of music on human emotions. The screening and filtering of articles were performed in three iterations. In the first iteration, duplicate articles were excluded. In the second iteration, the articles were filtered according to their titles and abstracts, and articles outside of the scope of our domain were excluded. In the third iteration, the articles were filtered by reading the full text and excluding articles outside of the scope of our domain and which do not meet our criteria. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 100 articles were selected and separated into five classes. The first class includes 39 articles (39%) consists of emotion, wherein various emotions are classified using artificial intelligence (AI). The second class includes 21 articles (21%) is composed of studies that use EEG techniques. This class is named ` brain condition'. The third class includes eight articles (8%) is related to feature extraction, which is a step before emotion classification. That this process makes use of classifiers should be noted. However, these articles are not listed under the first class because these eight articles focus on feature extraction rather than classifier accuracy. The fourth class includes 26 articles (26%) comprises studies that compare between or among two ormore groups to identify and discover human emotion-based EEG. The final class includes six articles (6%) represents articles that study music as a stimulus and its impact on brain signals. Then, discussed the five main categories which are action types, age of the participants, and number size of the participants, duration of recording and listening to music and lastly countries or authors' nationality that published these previous studies. it afterward recognizes the main characteristics of this promising area of science in: motivation of using EEG process for measuring human brain signals, open challenges obstructing employment and recommendations to improve the utilization of EEG process.","[Hamada, Mohamed; Zaidan, B.

Manual urine sediment examination is labor-intensive, subjective and time-consuming, and the traditional automatic algorithms often extract the hand-crafted features for recognition. Instead of using the hand-crafted features, in this paper we propose to exploit convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn features in an end-to-end manner to recognize the urinary particle. We treat the urinary particle recognition as object detection and exploit two state-of-the-art CNN-based object detection methods, Faster R-CNN and single shot multibox detector (SSD), along with their variants for urinary particle recognition. We further investigate different factors involving these CNN-based methods to improve the performance of urinary particle recognition. We comprehensively evaluate these methods on a dataset consisting of 5,376 annotated images corresponding to 7 categories of urinary particle, i.e., erythrocyte, leukocyte, epithelial cell, crystal, cast, mycete, epithelial nuclei, and obtain a best mean average precision (mAP) of 84.1% while taking only 72 ms per image on a NVIDIA Titan X GPU.","[Liang, Yixiong; Kang, Rui; Lian, Chunyan; Mao, Yuan] Cent South Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China","Liang, YX (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China.",yxliang@csu.edu.cn,", Yixiong/AAQ-2023-2020; LIANG, YIXIONG/ABC-6068-2021",", Yixiong/0000-0002-2260-066X; Liang, Yixiong/0000-0003-0407-5838","Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China [14JJ2008]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61602522, 61573380, 61672542]","This research was partially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China (No. 14JJ2008) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61602522, No. 61573380, No. 61672542.",,40,9,11,2,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Deficiencies in supplies impact on operating room efficiency and patient safety. In our institution, we do not have anesthesia assistants/aides and depend on general aides to stock anesthesia related equipment which resulted in many shortages. We hypothesized that a mobile app would be useful for tracking and reporting and informing changes to stocking resulting in an improvement in the supply of anesthesia equipment. Following institutional quality improvement approval, we developed an app to collect metrics (which included the last 2 months of paper documentation - September and October 2015) and the first 12 months of the app usage (November 2015 to November 2016). Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data from the app. The primary outcome was the number of reports made over time. Secondary outcomes include the impact of missing items on operating room efficiency and patient safety, the most commonly reported missing items, and the most common actions taken following the discovery of missing items. The app increased the reporting by more than 300% (compared to paper) over the first 2 months. Over the year, 549 items were reported missing. The most common category of missing items was airway related 274 (49.9%). The single most commonly reported missing item was the Wisconsin Laryngoscope Size 1 Blade 95 (17.3%). App users reported the missing item safety impact as high 86 (15.7%) times and efficiency impact as high 117 (21.3%) times. Changes to staffing and supply resulted in a decrease in missing items reported. Our results demonstrate that an app can be useful for reporting, tracking of real-time shortages of anesthesia equipment and is easy to design and implement. Furthermore, the app has generated useful and robust data that has led to staffing changes and improvements in the anesthesia equipment supply chain. The app design and use may be useful in other clinical areas.","[Matava, Clyde T.; Tan, Michael] Hosp Sick Children, Dept Anesthesia & Pain Med, 555 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; [Matava, Clyde T.; Tan, Michael] Univ Toronto, Fac Med, Dept Anesthesia, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Magbitang, Joyce; Choi, Sunny; Bhatia, Sabrina] Hosp Sick Children, Perioperat Care Unit, Informat Syst, Toronto, ON, Canada","Matava, CT (corresponding author), Hosp Sick Children, Dept Anesthesia & Pain Med, 555 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada.;Matava, CT (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Fac Med, Dept Anesthesia, Toronto, ON, Canada.",clyde.matava@sickkids.ca,"Matava, Clyde/AAK-9531-2020","Matava, Clyde/0000-0002-9502-0981",,,,16,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Electronic health records (EHRs) are a common and convenient mechanism for examining processes of care; however, there is not an indication for cannabis use that does not meet criteria for a diagnostic disorder. We used urine drug test (UDT) results identified through EHRs to identify patients with confirmed cannabis use. We developed and tested an algorithm to identify outcomes of UDT results for cannabis because there is wide variability in reporting methodology, including in multi-site health systems. Among all patients receiving care in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) who were prescribed long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain, we identified a random sample who completed UDT for cannabis. Through an iterative process, we developed an algorithm to identify UDT cannabis results. Manual review of EHR data was conducted to verify accuracy of UDT results. The final UDT algorithm correctly identified 99% of cannabis positive UDT results and 100% of cannabis negative UDT results among 200 randomly sampled patients. Study findings suggest a high degree of accuracy for using an algorithm to identify samples of patients with positive cannabis UDT results across multiple institutions with disparate UDT reporting practices. The methodology for testing this algorithm is feasible and may be applied to other multi-site health systems.","[Morasco, Benjamin J.; Shull, Sarah E.; Adams, Melissa H.; Dobscha, Steven K.; Lovejoy, Travis I.] VA Portland Hlth Care Syst R&D99, Ctr Improve Vet Involvement Care, 3710 SW US Vet Hosp Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Morasco, Benjamin J.; Dobscha, Steven K.; Lovejoy, Travis I.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Psychiat, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Lovejoy, Travis I.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Portland, OR 97201 USA","Morasco, BJ (corresponding author), VA Portland Hlth Care Syst R&D99, Ctr Improve Vet Involvement Care, 3710 SW US Vet Hosp Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA.;Morasco, BJ (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Psychiat, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",benjamin.morasco@va.gov,,,National Institute on Drug Abuse of the National Institutes of Health [034083]; VA Health Services Research & Development service [1I01HX001583]; VA Health Services Research and Development [CIN 13-404]; Veterans Affairs [IK2HX001516] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,Research reported in this manuscript was supported by grant 034083 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the National Institutes of Health and 1I01HX001583 from the VA Health Services Research & Development service.

Several factors support this process. Advances in omics allows individualization of diagnosis and treatment. Patient awareness and easy availability of data on the Internet allows patients to become informed decision makers when it comes even to disease management. Mass media emphasize the issue of medical errors, making patients demanding for quality in medical care. In some healthcare settings, patents face a problem of interpreting medical data and making decisions on treatment tactics without having a doctor, who could potentially support them. Delegating this task to a Patient Decision Aide system can add automatically generated recommendations to result reports without adding significant workload on the doctors, increase patients' motivation and support their decisions. We have implemented a patient decision aid system based on the productions rules, which: Collects data from available sources; Automatically analyses and interprets laboratory test results; Recommends running additional tests for a more precise diagnostic; Delivers automatically generated reports to doctors and patients in a natural language. To achieve semantic interoperability with other systems we have implemented a FHIR engine. The knowledge base has been organized as a graph structure. The application is structured as a set of lightly coupled services, which implement the logic of the decision support system. In total, we have modelled 365 nodes of test components, 5084 nodes of inference rules, 49932 connections and 3072 blocks of text for medical certificates. The findings of the research provide a deep understanding of how the semantically interoperable clinical decision support systems are implemented. Advances in notification the patients with the elements of patient decision aid is important for clinical data management, and for patients' empowerment and protection. We suppose that the system empowering patients in such way can play a meaningful role in helping patients to make informed decisions during the process of diagnostics and treatment.","[Semenov, Ilia; Denisov, Dmitry; Osenev, Roman; Andreychuk, Yury] Medlinx LLC, St Petersburg, Russia; [Kopanitsa, Georgy] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Lenina 30, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Alexandr, Yakovenko] Helix Lab Serv, St Petersburg, Russia","Kopanitsa, G (corresponding author), Tomsk Polytech Univ, Lenina 30, Tomsk 634050, Russia.",georgy.kopanitsa@gmail.com,"Kopanitsa, Georgy/M-8418-2016","Kopanitsa, Georgy/0000-0002-6231-8036",Russian Science Foundation (RSF); Tomsk Polytechnic University Competitiveness Enhancement Program grant; Russian Science Foundation [17-71-10076] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,"The research is funded from Russian Science Foundation (RSF), The research was at Tomsk Polytechnic University within the framework of Tomsk Polytechnic University Competitiveness Enhancement Program grant.",,49,7,8,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

However, best practices concerning the implementation, use, and impact of these portals are poorly understood. To improve evaluation and implementation efforts, this paper develops a logic model that can help researchers and hospital managers in deploying and assessing the impact of inpatient portals. Guided by the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) framework, we held a series of two focus groups (n = 12 and n = 8, respectively) and an online forum (n = 14) including hospital administrators, clinicians, patients, and information technology team members to learn from these stakeholders about the system-wide implementation and evaluation of an inpatient portal at an academic medical center in the United States. These sessions were supplemented with a Nominal Group process to assess the relative importance and feasibility of evaluation areas. Our Logic Model highlights that patients are at the center of the multi-stakeholder context within which inpatient portals are being implemented, and that collaborative work is necessary for successful implementation and evaluation of the tool. The Model also identifies priority areas for evaluation, and it suggests measures and data sources applicable for quality improvement and research. Applying the SEIPS 2.0 framework, this Logic Model captures the multiple relevant stakeholder perspectives by describing the organizational structures, processes, and outcomes that pertain to inpatient portals. This Model provides specific evaluation suggestions for hospital managers seeking to implement inpatient portals as well as for researchers seeking to evaluate this new technology.","[Walker, Daniel M.; Hefner, Jennifer L.; Sieck, Cynthia J.; Huerta, Timothy R.; McAlearney, Ann Scheck] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Family Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Walker, Daniel M.; Hefner, Jennifer L.; Sieck, Cynthia J.; Huerta, Timothy R.; McAlearney, Ann Scheck] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Ctr Adv Team Sci Analyt & Syst Thinking, CATALYST, 460 Med Ctr Dr,Ste 530, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Walker, Daniel M.; Huerta, Timothy R.; McAlearney, Ann Scheck] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biomed Informat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Huerta, Timothy R.; McAlearney, Ann Scheck] Ohio State Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Serv Management & Policy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","McAlearney, AS (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Family Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;McAlearney, AS (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Ctr Adv Team Sci Analyt & Syst Thinking, CATALYST, 460 Med Ctr Dr,Ste 530, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;McAlearney, AS (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biomed Informat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;McAlearney, AS (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Serv Management & Policy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",Ann.McAlearney@osumc.edu,"Hefner, Jennifer L/P-5962-2014","Hefner, Jennifer L/0000-0001-8083-8038","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) [R01 HS024091-01, R21 HS024349-01]; Ohio State University Institute for the Design of Environments Aligned For Patient Safety (IDEA4PS) [P30-HS024379]; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY [R01HS024091] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Grants R01 HS024091-01 and R21 HS024349-01 as well as P30-HS024379 through The Ohio State University Institute for the Design of Environments Aligned For Patient Safety (IDEA4PS).

The expansion of information and communication technologies has led to new models for the delivery healthcare services in telemedicine. Therefore, mHealth plays an imperative role in the sustainable delivery of healthcare services in telemedicine. This paper presents a comprehensive review of healthcare service provision. It highlights the open issues and challenges related to the use of the real-time fault-tolerant mHealth system in telemedicine. The methodological aspects of mHealth are examined, and three distinct and successive phases are presented. The first discusses the identification process for establishing a decision matrix based on a crossover of 'time of arrival of patient at the hospital/multi-services' and 'hospitals' within mHealth. The second phase discusses the development of a decision matrix for hospital selection based on the MAHP method. The third phase discusses the validation of the proposed system.","[Albahri, A.

Medulloblastoma is that subtype of brain tumour which occurs most frequently amongst children. Post-operation, the classification of its subtype is most vital for further clinical management. In this paper a novel approach of pathological subtype classification using biological interpretable and computer-aided textural features is forwarded. The classifier for accurate features prediction is built purely on the feature set obtained by segmentation of the ground truth cells from the original histological tissue images, marked by an experienced pathologist. The work is divided into five stages: marking of ground truth, segmentation of ground truth images, feature extraction, feature reduction and finally classification. Kmeans colour segmentation is used to segment out the ground truth cells from histological images. For feature extraction we used morphological, colour and textural features of the cells followed by feature reduction using Principal Component Analysis. Finally both binary and multiclass classification is done using Support Vector Method (SVM). The classification was compared using six different classifiers and performance was evaluated employing five-fold cross-validation technique. The accuracy achieved for binary and multiclass classification before applying PCA were 95.4 and 62.1% and after applying PCA were 100 and 84.9% respectively. The run-time analysis are also shown. Results reveal that this technique of cell level classification can be successfully adopted as architectural view can be confusing. Moreover it conforms substantially to the pathologist's point of view regarding morphological and colour features, with the addition of computer assisted texture feature.","[Das, Daisy; Mahanta, Lipi B.] Inst Adv Study Sci & Technol, Ctr Computat & Numer Studies, Gauhati 781035, India; [Ahmed, Shabnam] Guwahati Neurol Res Ctr, Dept Pathol, Gauhati 781006, India; [Baishya, Basanta Kr.; Haque, Inamul] Guwahati Med Coll & Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Gauhati 781032, India","Mahanta, LB (corresponding author), Inst Adv Study Sci & Technol, Ctr Computat & Numer Studies, Gauhati 781035, India.",lbmahanta@iasst.gov.in,"Mahanta, Lipi B/R-6375-2019","Mahanta, Lipi B/0000-0002-7733-5461",,,,28,7,7,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Medical images such as Mammogram, Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and microscopic images are the common method for cancer diagnosis. Recently, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been used to help physicians in cancer diagnosis so that the diagnosis accuracy can be improved. CAD can help in decreasing missed cancer lesions due to physician fatigue, reducing the burden of workload and data overloading, and decreasing variability of inter- and intra-readers of images. In this research, a framework of CAD systems for cancer diagnosis based on medical images has been proposed. The proposed work helps physicians in detection of suspicion regions using different medical images modalities and in classifying the detected suspicious regions as normal or abnormal with the highest possible accuracy. The proposed framework of CAD system consists of four stages which are: preprocessing, segmentation of regions of interest, feature extraction and selection, and finally classification. In this research, the framework has been applied on blood smear images to diagnose the cases as normal or abnormal for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) cases. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) has been used to select the subsets of features from the features extracted from segmented cell parts which can maximize the classification performance as possible. Different classifiers which are Decision Tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), Na < ve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been applied. The framework has been yielding promising results which reached 96.25% accuracy, 97.3% sensitivity, and 95.35% specificity using decision tree classifier.","[El Houby, Enas M.

They are stored in different hospitals' databases, even for the same patient. Therefore, it is difficult to construct a summarized EMR for one patient from multiple hospital databases due to the security and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, current EMRs systems lack a standard data management and sharing policy, making it difficult for pharmaceutical scientists to develop precise medicines based on data obtained under different policies. To solve the above problems, we proposed a blockchain-based information management system, MedBlock, to handle patients' information. In this scheme, the distributed ledger of MedBlock allows the efficient EMRs access and EMRs retrieval. The improved consensus mechanism achieves consensus of EMRs without large energy consumption and network congestion. In addition, MedBlock also exhibits high information security combining the customized access control protocols and symmetric cryptography. MedBlock can play an important role in the sensitive medical information sharing.","[Fan, Kai; Wang, Shangyang; Ren, Yanhui; Li, Hui] Xidian Univ, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yintang] Xidian Univ, Minist Educ Wide Band Gap Semicon Mat & Devices, Key Lab, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Fan, K (corresponding author), Xidian Univ, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",kfan@mail.xidian.edu.cn,"Li, Hui/ABB-6752-2020","Li, Hui/0000-0001-8310-7169; Fan, Kai/0000-0001-6870-6657","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0802300]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61772403, U1401251]; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China [2017JM6004]; National 111 Program of China [B16037, B08038]","This study was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2017YFB0802300), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61772403 and No. U1401251), Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China (No. 2017JM6004), and National 111 Program of China B16037 and B08038.",,25,146,154,15,207,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the interest of preoperative instruction (PI) reminders by SMS compared to telephone calls. This was a prospective single center before-and-after study. Patients scheduled in ambulatory surgery were included during 2 consecutive periods of 10 weeks. The Call group received a telephone call for preoperative instructions (PI) and the SMS group received an automated protocol SMS reminder. The primary endpoint was patient compliance with PI and time of convocation. The two populations were compared with a non-inferiority hypothesis and the impact of the contact modality on compliance with the PI was assessed using a propensity score. The analysis concerned 301 patients in the Call group and 298 in the SMS group. The absence of dysfunction was observed in 75% of patients in the SMS group compared with 61% in the Call group (Risk difference: 14% [95%CI: 7-21]). The use of SMS was associated with a significant improvement in compliance with the PI (Odds ratio: 1.90 [1.48-2.42]; p < 0.0001). Patient satisfaction was similar regardless of the method of PI reminders. The automation of preoperative SMS reminders is associated with a better respect of the PI compared to the conventional calling method.

This paper proposes a new and simple system for microcalcification detection to assist in early breast cancer detection. This work uses the two most recognized public mammogram databases, MIAS and DDSM. We are introducing a MC detection method based on (1) Beucher gradient for detection of regions of interest (ROIs), (2) an annulus model for extraction of few and effective features from candidates to MCs, and (3) one classification stage with two different classifiers, k Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). For dense mammograms in the MIAS database, the performance metrics achieved are sensitivity of 0.9835, false alarm rate of 0.0083, accuracy of 0.9835, and area under the ROC curve of 0.9980 with a KNN classifier. The proposed MC detection method, based on a KNN classifier, achieves, a sensitivity, false positive rate, accuracy and area under the ROC curve of 0.9813, 0.0224, 0.9795 and 0.9974 for the MIAS database; and 0.9035, 0.0439, 0.9298 and 0.9759 for the DDSM database. By slightly reducing the true positive rate the method achieves three instances with false positive rate of 0: 2 on fatty mammograms with KNN and SVM, and one on dense with SVM.

In this work, we reviewed their protocol and found that it is not secure against stolen verifier attack, many logged in patient attack, patient anonymity, impersonation attack, and fails to protect session key. For enhancement of security level, we proposed a new mutual authentication protocol for the similar environment. The presented framework is also more capable in terms of computation cost. In addition, the security evaluation of the protocol protects resilience of all possible security attributes, and we also explored formal security evaluation based on random oracle model.

In addition, we use prudent data storage strategies and a variety of cryptographic algorithms to guarantee user privacy; e.g., an adversary is unable to read the plain text even if the data are stolen.

As a consequence, obtaining the valuable medical data with minimal cost and impacts on hospital work comes as the first concern of researchers. Anesthesia plays a widely recognized role in surgeries, which attracts people to undertake relevant research. In this paper, a real-time physiological medical signal data acquisition system (PMSDA) for the multi-operating room applications is proposed with high universality of the hospital practical settings and research requirements. By utilizing a wireless communication approach, it provides an easily accessible network platform for collection of physiological medical signals such as photoplethysmogram (PPG), electrocardiograph (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) during the surgery. In addition, the raw data is stored on a server for safe backup and further analysis of depth of anesthesia (DoA). Results show that the PMSDA exhibits robust, high quality performance and efficiently reduces costs compared to previously manual methods and allows seamless integration into hospital environment, independent of its routine work. Overall, it provides a pragmatic and flexible surgery-data acquisition system model with low impact and resource cost applicable to research in critical and practical medical circumstances.","[Liu, Quan; Ma, Li] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Informat Engn, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Quan; Ma, Li] Minist Educ, Key Lab Fiber Opt Sensing Technol & Informat Proc, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Fan, Shou-Zen] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Anesthesiol, Coll Med, Taipei 100, Taiwan; [Abbod, Maysam F.] Brunel Univ London, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Lu, Cheng-Wei; Lin, Tzu-Yu; Shieh, Jiann-Shing] Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 135 Yuan Tung Rd, Chungli 32003, Taiwan; [Lu, Cheng-Wei; Lin, Tzu-Yu; Shieh, Jiann-Shing] Yuan Ze Univ, Innovat Ctr Big Data & Digital Convergence, 135 Yuan Tung Rd, Chungli 32003, Taiwan; [Lu, Cheng-Wei; Lin, Tzu-Yu] Far Eastern Mem Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, Ban Chiao, Taiwan; [Jen, Kuo-Kuang; Wu, Shang-Ju] Natl Chung Shan Inst Sci & Technol, Taoyuan, Longtan, Taiwan","Shieh, JS (corresponding author), Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 135 Yuan Tung Rd, Chungli 32003, Taiwan.;Shieh, JS (corresponding author), Yuan Ze Univ, Innovat Ctr Big Data & Digital Convergence, 135 Yuan Tung Rd, Chungli 32003, Taiwan.",quanliu@whut.edu.cn; excellentmary@whut.edu.cn; shouzen@gmail.com; maysam.abbod@brunel.ac.uk; drluchengwei@gmail.com; drlin1971@gmail.com; rgg@ms7.hinet.net; shanglu111@gmail.com; jsshieh@saturn.yzu.edu.tw,,"Fan, Shou-Zen/0000-0002-6849-8453","Wuhan University of Technology international exchange program [2015-JL-012]; National Chung-Shan Institute of Science & Technology in Taiwan [CSIST-095-V401]; China National Nature Science Foundation [51475342, 51675389]","This research, sponsored by Wuhan University of Technology international exchange program (Grant Number: 2015-JL-012).

It is used to monitor the physical condition and provide a reliable healthcare system. Utilizing the wireless communication network, sensor nodes collect the physiological data of one patient to the portable mobile device and the latter analyzes and transmits them to the application providers. Therefore, the personal data confidentiality and user privacy are cores of WBANs. Recently, Shen et al. presented a multi-layer authentication protocol for WBANs, which is lightweight and much easier to implement. However, we observe that their authentication between sensor nodes and the portable mobile device could ensure the forward security property only when the sensor nodes are changed (add or delete). When the sensor nodes are constant, the security property is not satisfied. Meanwhile, the authentication between the portable mobile device and application provider is prone to mutual impersonation attack, so the critical goal of mutual authentication can not be achieved. In this paper, an improved two-layer authentication scheme is proposed to remove the flaws. The analysis shows that our method is more secure and could withstand various attacks.","[Liu, Xiaoguang; Li, Fagen] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Ctr Cyber Secur, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaoguang] Southwest Univ Nationalities, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Jin, Chunhua] Huaiyin Inst Technol, Lab Internet Things & Mobile Internet Technol Jia, Huaian 223003, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Liu, XG (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Ctr Cyber Secur, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Liu, XG (corresponding author), Southwest Univ Nationalities, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",21700128@swun.edu.cn; xajch0206@163.com; fagenli@uestc.edu.cn,,"liu, xiaoguang/0000-0003-4909-8726",Key Fund Project of Sichuan Provincial Department of Education [17ZA0414]; Laboratory for Internet of Things and Mobile Internet Technology of Jiangsu Province [JSWLW-2017-006],"This work is supported by the Key Fund Project of Sichuan Provincial Department of Education (No: 17ZA0414), and the Laboratory for Internet of Things and Mobile Internet Technology of Jiangsu Province (No: JSWLW-2017-006).",,45,14,14,3,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Traditional authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocols in TMIS are mostly considered in same-domain environment. However, future generation network may integrate various of wireless mesh networks under various domain. What's more, patients heterogeneous cross-domain service has become an inevitable trend. However, there is still no heterogeneous cross-domain authenticated protocol between PKI-domain and IBC-domain in TMIS. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous cross-domain AKA protocol with symptoms-matching in TMIS (short for CDAKA). It not only keeps good security features, but also truly provides patients' anonymity to protect sensitive information from illegal interception. It still provides patients in two different domains to share their experience, broaden their understanding of illness by using their mobile device freely. Besides, it can realize AKA with extremely low computing cost and communication cost. What's more, it is proved to be secure against known possible attacks under the Elliptic Curve Computable Diffie-Hellman problem (ECDHP) assumption in the random oracle model. Hence, these features make CDAKA protocol very suitable for mobile application scenarios, where resource is severely constrained and security is particularly concerned.","[Liu, Xiaoxue; Ma, Wenping] Xidian Univ, 2 South Taibai Rd, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Liu, XX (corresponding author), Xidian Univ, 2 South Taibai Rd, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",862417756@qq.com; wp_ma@mail.xidian.edu.cn,,,National Science Foundation of China [61373171]; 111 Project [B08038]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0802400],"This study was funded by National Science Foundation of China under grant (61373171), The 111 Project under grant(B08038), National Key R&D Program of China(2017YFB0802400).",,34,4,5,2,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

However, the various characterizations of patient flow, cohort decisions, sub-processes, and the diverse stakeholders requiring data visibility create further overlying complexity. We use the Donabedian model to prioritize patient flow metrics and build an electronic dashboard for enabling communication. Ten metrics were identified as key indicators including outcome (length of stay, 30-day readmission, operating room exit delays, capacity-related diversions), process (timely inpatient unit discharge, emergency department disposition), and structural metrics (occupancy, discharge volume, boarding, bed assignation duration). Dashboard users provided real-life examples of how the tool is assisting capacity improvement efforts, and user traffic data revealed an uptrend in dashboard utilization from May to October 2017 (26 to 148 views per month, respectively). Our main contributions are twofold. The former being the results and methods for selecting key performance indicators for a unit, department, and across the entire hospital (i.e., separating signal from noise). The latter being an electronic dashboard deployed and used at The Johns Hopkins Hospital to visualize these ten metrics and communicate systematically to hospital stakeholders.

The proposed solution includes a technical specification for classifiers in an extensible medical imaging archive, a classification database for querying over the extracted information, and a set of proof-of-concept convolutional neural network classifiers for identifying the presence of organs in computed tomography scans. The system automatically extracts the anatomic region features, which are saved in the proposed database for later consumption by multimodal querying mechanisms. The classifiers were evaluated with cross-validation, yielding a best F1-score of 96% and an average accuracy of 97%.

This paper presents a novel method of using deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for identification and measurement of IMT on the far wall of the artery. The Region of Interest (ROI) is extracted using CNN architecture with 8 layers. 110 subjects are taken for the study. Each subject is recorded with one Right Common Carotid Artery (RCCA) and Left Common Carotid Artery (LCCA) frame resulting in 220 recordings. Patch based segmentation with 2640 patches are given to the training network for ROI localization. Intima Media Complex (IMC) is the area where IMT is measured. This region is extracted after defining the ROI. Keeping in mind the end objective of measurement of IMT values binary threshold with snake algorithm is applied to extract the lumen-intima and media-adventitia boundary. IMT values are measured for 20 cases and mean difference is found to be 0.08 mm.,"[Sudha, S.; Jayanthi, K.

In target areas like Kenya TB is highly prevalent and often co-occurring with HIV combined with low resources and limited medical assistance. In these regions an automatic screening system can provide a cost-effective solution for a large rural population. Our completely automatic TB screening system is processing the incoming CXRs (chest X-ray) by applying image preprocessing techniques to enhance the image quality followed by an adaptive segmentation based on model selection. The delineated lung regions are described by a multitude of image features. These characteristics are than optimized by a feature selection strategy to provide the best description for the classifier, which will later decide if the analyzed image is normal or abnormal. Our goal is to find the optimal feature set from a larger pool of generic image features, -used originally for problems such as object detection, image retrieval, etc. For performance evaluation measures such as under the curve (AUC) and accuracy (ACC) were considered. Using a neural network classifier on two publicly available data collections, -namely the Montgomery and the Shenzhen dataset, we achieved the maximum area under the curve and accuracy of 0.99 and 97.03%, respectively. Further, we compared our results with existing state-of-the-art systems and to radiologists' decision.","[Vajda, Szilard] Cent Washington Univ, Ellensburg, WA 98926 USA; [Karargyris, Alexandros] IBM Almaden Res, San Jose, CA USA; [Santosh, K.

To avoid such a medical accident, it is necessary to provide the ureter position information to the doctor. For the detection of ureter position, an ureter position detection and display system with the augmented ris proposed to detect the ureter that is covered by human tissue. There are two key issues which should be considered in this new system. One is how to detect the covered ureter that cannot be captured by the electronic endoscope and the other is how to display the ureter position that provides stable and high-quality images. Simultaneously, any delayed processing of the system should disturb the surgery. The aided hardware detection method and target detection algorithms are proposed in this system. To mark the ureter position, a surface-lighting plastic optical fiber (POF) with the encoded light-emitting diode (LED) light is used to indicate the ureter position. The monochrome channel filtering algorithm (MCFA) is proposed to locate the ureter region more precisely. The ureter position is extracted using the proposed automatic region growing algorithm (ARGA) that utilizes the statistical information of the monochrome channel for the selection of growing seed point. In addition, according to the pulse signal of encoded light, the recognition of bright and dark frames based on the aided hardware (BDAH) is proposed to expedite the processing speed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed endoscope system can identify 92.04% ureter region in average.","[Yu, Feng; Song, Enmin; Liu, Hong; Zhu, Jun] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Li, Yunlong] Jiangsu Univ, Affiliated Kunsan Hosp, Dept Urol, Kunshan 215300, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hung, Chih-Cheng] Kennesaw State Univ, Ctr Machine Vis & Secur Res, Kennesaw, GA USA","Liu, H (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",yffly@163.com; esong@hust.edu.cn; hl.cbib@gmail.com; liyunlong30022015@163.com; junzzy@hust.edu.cn; chung1@kennesaw.edu,,"Yu, Feng/0000-0001-8252-5131","National Key R & D Program of China [2017YFC0112804]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61370179]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [HUST: 2016YXZD018, HUST: 2017JYCX038]; Medical Clinical Science and Technology Development Fund of Jiangsu University [JLY20140051C]; Clinical Medicine Science and Technology Projects in Jiangsu province [BL2014056]","This work was supported by National Key R & D Program of China, No. 2017YFC0112804, National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant project No. 61370179, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, HUST: 2016YXZD018 and HUST: 2017JYCX038, Medical Clinical Science and Technology Development Fund of Jiangsu University, No. JLY20140051C, and Clinical Medicine Science and Technology Projects in Jiangsu province, No. BL2014056.",,35,8,8,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In recent years, blockchain has been proposed to be a promising solution to achieve personal health information (PHI) sharing with security and privacy preservation due to its advantages of immutability. This work proposes a blockchain-based secure and privacy-preserving PHI sharing (BSPP) scheme for diagnosis improvements in e-Health systems. Firstly, two kinds of blockchains, private blockchain and consortium blockchain, are constructed by devising their data structures, and consensus mechanisms. The private blockchain is responsible for storing the PHI while the consortium blockchain keeps records of the secure indexes of the PHI. In order to achieve data security, access control, privacy preservation and secure search, all the data including the PHI, keywords and the patients' identity are public key encrypted with keyword search. Furthermore, the block generators are required to provide proof of conformance for adding new blocks to the blockchains, which guarantees the system availability. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol can meet with the security goals. Furthermor, we implement the proposed scheme on JUICE to evaluate the performance.","[Zhang, Aiqing] Anhui Normal Univ, Coll Phys & Elect Informat, Wuhu 241000, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Lin, Xiaodong] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Fac Sci, 75 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada","Zhang, AQ (corresponding author), Anhui Normal Univ, Coll Phys & Elect Informat, Wuhu 241000, Anhui, Peoples R China.",aqzhang2006@163.com; xlin@wlu.ca,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [61601005, 61571240]; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province [1608085QF138, 1808085MF164]; Anhui Provincial Key Laboratory of Network and Information Security [AHNIS2018003]; Scientific Research Staring Foundation of Anhui Normal University [2014bsqdjj38]","This work is partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 61601005, No. 61571240), Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province (Grant No. 1608085QF138, No. 1808085MF164), Anhui Provincial Key Laboratory of Network and Information Security (Grant No. AHNIS2018003), and Scientific Research Staring Foundation of Anhui Normal University (Grant No. 2014bsqdjj38).",,33,166,181,41,220,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In this paper, we propose the MIStore, a blockchain-based medical insurance storage system. Due to blockchain's the property of tamper-resistance, MIStore may provide a high-credibility to users. In a basic instance of the system, there are a hospital, patient, insurance company and n servers. Specifically, the hospital performs a (t, n)-threshold MIStore protocol among the n servers. For the protocol, any node of the blockchain may join the protocol to be a server if the node and the hospital wish. Patient's spending data is stored by the hospital in the blockchain and is protected by the n servers. Any t servers may help the insurance company to obtain a sum of a part of the patient's spending data, which servers can perform homomorphic computations on. However, the n servers cannot learn anything from the patient's spending data, which recorded in the blockchain, forever as long as more than n - t servers are honest. Besides, because most of verifications are performed by record-nodes and all related data is stored at the blockchain, thus the insurance company, servers and the hospital only need small memory and CPU. Finally, we deploy the MIStore on the Ethererum blockchain and give the corresponding performance evaluation.","[Zhou, Lijing; Wang, Licheng; Sun, Yiru] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China","Wang, LC (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.",wanglc2012@126.com,,"Zhou, Lijing/0000-0002-8735-2329",National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFB0800602]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61502048]; Shandong provincial Key R&D Program of China [2018CXGC0701],"This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFB0800602), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Grant No. 61502048), and Shandong provincial Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2018CXGC0701).",,31,51,52,7,90,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

This study proposes a meta-heuristic framework using stochastic local search (SLS) combined with random forest (RF) where the aim is to specify the most important genes and proteins leading to the best classification of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients. First we use a stochastic local search meta-heuristic as a feature selection technique to select the most significant proteins to be used in the classification task step. Then we apply RF to classify new patients into their corresponding classes. The evaluation technique is to run the RF classifier on the training data to get a model. Then, we apply this model on the test data to find the appropriate class. We use as metrics the balanced accuracy (BAC) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) to measure the performance of our model. The proposed method is evaluated on the dataset issued from DREAM 9 challenge. The comparison is done with a pure random forest (without feature selection), and with the two best ranked results of the DREAM 9 challenge. We used three types of data: only clinical data, only proteomics data, and finally clinical and proteomics data combined. The numerical results show that the highest scores are obtained when using clinical data alone, and the lowest is obtained when using proteomics data alone.

This solution significantly limits the data available for historical analysis, because it typically uses databases that are not effective in storing large volumes of data. In industry, a specific Big Data Historian, known as a Process Information Management System (PIMS), solves this problem. This work proposes the same solution to overcome the restriction on storing vital sign data. The PIMS needs a compatible communication standard to allow storing, and the one most commonly used is the OLE for Process Control (OPC). This paper presents a HL7-OPC Server that permits communication between vital sign monitoring systems with PIMS, thus allowing the storage of long historical series of vital signs. In addition, it carries out a review about local and cloud-based Big Medical Data researches, followed by an analysis of the PIMS in a Health IT Environment. Then it shows the architecture of HL7 and OPC Standards. Finally, it shows the HL7-OPC Server and a sequence of tests that proved its full operation and performance.","[Cruz, Marcio Freire; Mattos Teixeira Cavalcante, Carlos Arthur; Sa Barretto, Sergio Torres] Fed Univ Bahia UFBA, Grad Program Mechatron, BR-40170110 Salvador, BA, Brazil","Cruz, MF (corresponding author), Fed Univ Bahia UFBA, Grad Program Mechatron, BR-40170110 Salvador, BA, Brazil.",marciofreire@gmail.com,,"Cruz, Marcio/0000-0001-5775-2244",,,,37,4,5,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Based on our own previous successes in the perioperative domain, in this work we detail an initiative that reduces surgical instrumentation waste of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedures by placing thoracotomy conversion instrumentation in a standby location and designing a specific instrument kit to be used solely for VATS cases. Our estimates suggest that this initiative will reduce at least 91,800 pounds of unnecessary surgical instrumentation from cycling through our ORs and reprocessing department annually, resulting in increased OR team communication without sacrificing the highest standard of patient safety.","[Friend, Tynan H.; Paula, Ashley; Klemm, Jason; Rosa, Mark; Levine, Wilton] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, 55 Fruit St,WHT 400, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Levine, W (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, 55 Fruit St,WHT 400, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",wlevine@partners.org,,"Levine, Wilton/0000-0003-3358-5327; Friend, Tynan/0000-0003-2556-7524",,,,20,4,4,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Using a private blockchain based on the Ethereum protocol, we created a system where the sensors communicate with a smart device that calls smart contracts and writes records of all events on the blockchain. This smart contract system would support real-time patient monitoring and medical interventions by sending notifications to patients and medical professionals, while also maintaining a secure record of who has initiated these activities. This would resolve many security vulnerabilities associated with remote patient monitoring and automate the delivery of notifications to all involved parties in a HIPAA compliant manner.","[Griggs, Kristen N.; Ossipova, Olya; Kohlios, Christopher P.; Baccarini, Alessandro N.; Howson, Emily A.; Hayajneh, Thaier] Fordham Univ, Fordham Ctr Cybersecur, New York, NY 10023 USA","Hayajneh, T (corresponding author), Fordham Univ, Fordham Ctr Cybersecur, New York, NY 10023 USA.",kgriggs2@fordham.edu; oossipova@fordham.edu; ckohlios@fordham.edu; abaccarini@fordham.edu; ehowson@fordham.edu; thayajneh@fordham.edu,"Sánchez-Gómez, Nicolás/K-3758-2014; Hayajneh, Thaier/H-3496-2019","Hayajneh, Thaier/0000-0002-8952-1499",,,,17,233,242,30,262,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Cataract and corneal arcus are the major abnormalities that exist in the anterior segment eye region of aged people. Hence, computer-aided diagnosis of anterior segment eye abnormalities will be helpful for mass screening and grading in ophthalmology. In this paper, we propose a multiclass computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system using visible wavelength (VW) eye images to diagnose anterior segment eye abnormalities. In the proposed method, the input VW eye images are pre-processed for specular reflection removal and the iris circle region is segmented using a circular Hough Transform (CHT)-based approach. The first-order statistical features and wavelet-based features are extracted from the segmented iris circle and used for classification. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) by Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm was used for the classification. In experiments, we used 228 VW eye images that belong to three different classes of anterior segment eye abnormalities. The proposed method achieved a predictive accuracy of 96.96% with 97% sensitivity and 99% specificity. The experimental results show that the proposed method has significant potential for use in clinical applications.","[Kumar, Mahesh S., V; Gunasundari, R.] Pondicherry Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Pondicherry, India","Kumar, SVM (corresponding author), Pondicherry Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Pondicherry, India.",svmaheshkumar@pec.edu,"/AAG-6737-2022; /AEX-2752-2022; V, MAHESH KUMAR S/AAJ-7717-2021",/0000-0001-9149-3354; /0000-0001-9149-3354; ,,,,28,10,11,1,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

We developed an innovative and simple, secure electronic health record (EHR) base text paging system to communicate with internal medicine residents. The goal is to avoid unnecessary interruption during patient care or educational activities and reduce stress. Traditional paging system can send a phone number to call back. We developed and implemented a HIPPA-compliant, EHR-integrated text paging at a busy 591-bed urban hospital. Access was granted to unit clerks, nursing staff, case managers, and physicians. Senders could either send a traditional telephone number page or a text page through our EHR. The recipient could then either acknowledge receipt of the page or take appropriate actions. Afterward, Internal medicine residents were polled on overall satisfaction difference between basic phone based numeric paging and the enhanced EHR text paging system. Educational interruptions (averaging over 7 pages) decreased from 64% to 16%. Patient care interruptions fell from 68% to 12%. 88% of residents felt that 50% or less of the pages were non-emergent and did not require an immediate action. 92% of 25 surveyed internal medicine residents preferred text paging over numeric paging and responded through the EHR 60% of the time by placing direct orders. Time savings using the new system over a 3-month span amounted to 72.5 h in transmission time alone. Text paging among medical caregivers and internal medicine residents through EHR-associated communication reduced patient care and educational interruptions. It saved time spent sending pages, answering unnecessary pages and it improved resident's subjective stress and satisfaction levels.","[Lapointe, Ryan; Bhesania, Siddharth; Tanner, Tristan; Peruri, Adithya; Mehta, Parag] NewYork Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hosp, Dept Med, 506 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11215 USA; [Lapointe, Ryan] Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Crit Care Med, 200 Lothrop St, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Peruri, Adithya] Henry Ford Macomb Hosp, 15855 19 Mile Rd, Clinton Township, MI 48038 USA","Bhesania, S (corresponding author), NewYork Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hosp, Dept Med, 506 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11215 USA.",lapointer@upmc.edu; srb9024@nyp.org; tgt9002@nyp.org; cavadith@gmail.com; phm9018@nyp.org,,"Bhesania, Siddharth/0000-0001-9809-0099",,,,13,10,10,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Because of their direct relationship with patients, nurses are also the most influential hospital staff who play a vital role in providing healthcare services. In this paper, a novel Data Envelopment Analysis Matrix (DEAM) approach is proposed for assessing the performance of nurses based on relative efficiency. The proposed model consists of five input variables (including type of employment, work experience, training hours, working hours and overtime hours) and eight output variables (the outputs are amount of hours each nurse spend on each of the eight activities including documentation, medical instructions, wound care and patient drainage, laboratory sampling, assessment and control care, follow-up and counseling and para-clinical measures, attendance during visiting and discharge suction) have been tested on 30 nurses from the heart department of a hospital in Iran. After determining the relative efficiency of each nurse based on the DEA model, the nurses' performance were evaluated in a DEAM format. As results the nurses were divided into four groups; superstars, potential stars, those who are needed to be trained effectively and question marks. Finally, based on the proposed approach, we have drawn some recommendations to policy makers in order to improve and maintain the performance of each of these groups. The proposed approach provides a practical framework for hospital managers so that they can assess the relative efficiency of nurses, plan and take steps to improve the quality of healthcare delivery.","[Najar, Ali Vafaee] Mashhad Univ Med Sci, Social Determinants Hlth Res Ctr, Mashhad, Iran; [Pooya, Alireza; Zoeram, Ali Alizadeh] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Management, Mashhad, Iran; [Zoeram, Ali Alizadeh] ACECR Acad Ctr Educ Culture & Res Khorasan Razavi, Mashhad, Iran; [Emrouznejad, Ali] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Dept Operat & Informat Management, Birmingham, W Midlands, England","Zoeram, AA (corresponding author), Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Management, Mashhad, Iran.;Zoeram, AA (corresponding author), ACECR Acad Ctr Educ Culture & Res Khorasan Razavi, Mashhad, Iran.",mgt.alizadeh@gmail.com,"Pooya, Alireza/ABA-1994-2020; najar, ali vafaee/Y-2899-2019; Emrouznejad, Ali/C-6707-2018; Pooya, Alireza/AEQ-7987-2022","najar, ali vafaee/0000-0002-2499-2687; Emrouznejad, Ali/0000-0001-8094-4244; Pooya, Alireza/0000-0001-6000-3535",,,,35,2,2,4,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Our aim is to develop a flexible, inexpensive, user-friendly and easily extensible system based on virtual reality for the measurement of the SVV and several related visual diagnostic tests, and validate it through an experimental evaluation. Two different hardware configurations were tested with 50 healthy volunteers in a controlled environment; 28 of them were males and 22 females, with ages ranging from 18 to 49 years, being 23 the average age. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was computed in each device. In addition, a usability survey was conducted. ICC = 0.85 in the first configuration (CI = 0.75-0.92), ICC = 0.76 in the second configuration (CI = 0.61-0.87), both with 95% of confidence, which means a substantial reliability. Moreover, 92.2% of subjects rated the usability of the system as very good. Our evaluation showed that the proposed system is suitable for the measurement of SVV in healthy subjects. The next step is to perform a more elaborated experimentation on patients and compare the results with the measurements obtained from traditional methods.","[Negrillo-Cardenas, Jose; Rueda-Ruiz, Antonio J.; Ogayar-Anguita, Carlos J.; Segura-Sanchez, Rafael J.] Univ Jaen, Dept Comp Sci, Campus Las Lagunillas S-N,A3 Bldg, Jaen 23071, Spain; [Lomas-Vega, Rafael] Univ Jaen, Dept Hlth Sci, Jaen, Spain","Negrillo-Cardenas, J (corresponding author), Univ Jaen, Dept Comp Sci, Campus Las Lagunillas S-N,A3 Bldg, Jaen 23071, Spain.",negrillo@ujaen.es; ajrueda@ujaen.es; cogayar@ujaen.es; rlomas@ujaen.es; rsegura@ujaen.es,"Ogayar-Anguita, Carlos-Javier/K-2166-2017; Rueda-Ruiz, Antonio Jesús/AAY-5298-2021; Cárdenas, José Negrillo/U-2043-2019; Segura, Rafael J./J-3622-2012","Ogayar-Anguita, Carlos-Javier/0000-0003-0958-990X; Rueda-Ruiz, Antonio Jesús/0000-0001-7692-454X; Cárdenas, José Negrillo/0000-0001-8916-923X; Segura, Rafael J./0000-0002-3075-6963","Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports [FPU16/01439]","This research was supported partially by the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports via a doctoral grant to the first author (Ref.

However, previous attempts to convince the private clinics to adopt EMRs to document health information have faced challenges, as the EMR adoption has been voluntary. The lack of electronic data shared by private clinics carries direct impacts to the efficacy of electronic record sharing between public and private healthcare providers. To increase the likelihood of buy-in, it is essential to proactively identify the users' and organizations' needs and capabilities before large-scale implementation. As part of the reform initiative, this study examined factors affecting the adoption of EMRs in small or solo private general practice clinics, by analyzing the experiences and opinions of the physicians and clinical assistants during the pilot implementation of the technology, with the purpose to learn from it before full-scale rollout. In-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted with 23 physicians and clinical assistants from seven small or solo private general practice clinics to evaluate their experiences, expectations, and opinions regarding the deployment of EMRs. Interview transcripts were content analyzed to identify key factors. Factors affecting the adoption of EMRs to record and manage health care information were identified as follows: system interface design; system functions; stability and reliability of hardware, software, and computing networks; financial and time costs; task and outcome performance, work practice, and clinical workflow; physical space in clinics; trust in technology; users' information technology literacy; training and technical support; and social and organizational influences. The factors are interrelated with the others. The adoption factors identified are multifaceted, ranging from technological characteristics, clinician-technology interactions, skills and knowledge, and the user-workflow-technology fit. Other findings, which have been relatively underrepresented in previous studies, contribute unique insights about the influence of work and social environment on the adoption of EMRs, including limited clinic space and the effects of physicians' decision to use the technology on clinical staffs' adoption decisions. Potential strategies to address the concerns, overcome adoption barriers, and define relevant policies are discussed.","[Or, Calvin] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Tong, Ellen; Chan, Summer] Hong Kong Hosp Author, Hlth Informat Dept, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Tan, Joseph] McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, Hamilton, ON, Canada","Or, C (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",klor@hku.hk; ellentong@ha.org.hk; tanjosep@mcmaster.ca; summer@ha.org.hk,,,Hospital Authority of Hong Kong [RCGASNA100001C]; University of Hong Kong,This study was supported in part by the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong (contract research project RCGASNA100001C; PI: Calvin Or) and the University of Hong Kong.,,43,10,12,4,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Significant difficulty faced by the audiologists is in effective programming of hearing aids to provide enhanced satisfaction to the users. The main aim of our study was to develop a software intelligent system (SIS): (i) to perform the required audiological investigations for finding the degree and type of hearing loss, and (ii) to suggest appropriate values of hearing aid parameters for enhancing the speech intelligibility and the satisfaction level among the hearing aid users. In this paper, we present a Neuro-Fuzzy based SIS to automatically predict and suggest the hearing-aid parameters such as gain values, compression ratio and threshold knee point, which are needed to be fixed for different octave frequencies of sound inputs during the hearing-aid trial. The test signals for audiological investigations are generated through the standard hardware present in a personal computer system and with the aid of a software algorithm. The proposed system was validated with 243 subjects' data collected at the Government General Hospital, Chennai, India. The calculated sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the proposed audiometer incorporated in the SIS were 98.6%, 96.4 and 98.2%, respectively, by comparing its interpretations with those of the 'gold standard' audiometers. Furthermore, 91% (221 of 243) of the hearing impaired subjects attained satisfaction in the first hearing aid trials itself with the gain values as recommended by the improved SIS. The proposed system reduced around 75% of the 'trial and error' time spent by audiologists for enhancing satisfactory usage of the hearing aid. Hence, the proposed SIS could be used to find the degree and type of hearing loss and to recommend hearing aid parameters to provide optimal solutions to the hearing aid users.","[Rajkumar, S.] Rajalakshmi Engn Coll, Dept Biomed Engn, Madras 602117, Tamil Nadu, India; [Muttan, S.] Anna Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Coll Engn, Madras 600025, Tamil Nadu, India; [Sapthagirivasan, V.] SRM Univ, Kancheepuram 603203, Tamil Nadu, India; [Sapthagirivasan, V.] IT Serv Co, Product & Engn Serv Dept, Med Solut Grp, Bengaluru 560066, Karnataka, India; [Jaya, V.; Vignesh, S.

The lack of standard of fragment data from those diabetic patients also makes the further potential phenotyping based on the diabetic data difficult. Traditional T2DM data repository only supports data collection from T2DM patients, lack of phenotyping ability and relied on standalone database design, limiting the secondary usage of these valuable data. To solve these issues, we proposed a novel T2DM data repository framework, which was based on standards. This repository can integrate data from various sources. It would be used as a standardized record for further data transfer as well as integration. Phenotyping was conducted based on clinical guidelines with KNIME workflow. To evaluate the phenotyping performance of the proposed system, data was collected from local community by healthcare providers and was then tested using algorithms. The results indicated that the proposed system could detect DR cases with an average accuracy of about 82.8%. Furthermore, these results had the promising potential of addressing fragmented data. The proposed system has integrating and phenotyping abilities, which could be used for diabetes research in future studies.","[Wu, Huiqun; Wei, Yufang; Shang, Yujuan; Shi, Wei; Wang, Lei; Shi, Lili; Jiang, Kui; Dong, Jiancheng] Nantong Univ, Med Sch, Dept Med Informat, 19 Qixiu Rd, Nantong 226001, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Jingjing; Sang, Aimin] Nantong Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Nantong 226001, Peoples R China","Jiang, K (corresponding author), Nantong Univ, Med Sch, Dept Med Informat, 19 Qixiu Rd, Nantong 226001, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",kuij@ntu.edu.cn,,"DONG, Jiancheng/0000-0002-9646-2853",National Natural Science Foundation of China [81501559]; Nantong University [YKC16072],"This study was funded by the grant of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81501559), Graduate Research and Innovation Plan Project of Nantong University (YKC16072).",,32,1,1,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Our objective was to develop a system that automatically generates an ASA PS with finer granularity by creating a continuous ASA PS score. Supervised machine learning methods were used to create a model that predicts a patient's ASA PS on a continuous scale using the patient's home medications and comorbidities. Three different types of predictive models were trained: regression models, ordinal models, and classification models. The performance and agreement of each model to anesthesiologists were compared by calculating the mean squared error (MSE), rounded MSE and Cohen's Kappa on a holdout set. To assess model performance on continuous ASA PS, model rankings were compared to two anesthesiologists on a subset of ASA PS 3 case pairs. The random forest regression model achieved the best MSE and rounded MSE. A model consisting of three random forest classifiers (split model) achieved the best Cohen's Kappa. The model's agreement with our anesthesiologists on the ASA PS 3 case pairs yielded fair to moderate Kappa values. The results suggest that the random forest split classification model can predict ASA PS with agreement similar to that of anesthesiologists reported in literature and produce a continuous score in which agreement in accurately judging granularity is fair to moderate.","[Zhang, Linda; Fabbri, Daniel; Lasko, Thomas A.; Ehrenfeld, Jesse M.; Wanderer, Jonathan P.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, 2525 West End Ave,Suite 14113, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Ehrenfeld, Jesse M.; Wanderer, Jonathan P.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Anesthesiol, 1301 Med Ctr Dr,Suite 4648, Nashville, TN 37232 USA","Zhang, L (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, 2525 West End Ave,Suite 14113, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",linda.zhang92@vanderbilt.edu,"Ehrenfeld, Jesse/AAI-2951-2020","Wanderer, Jonathan/0000-0002-3119-6873","NIH/NIBIB [R01EB020666]; NLM Training Grant from the National Institutes of Health located in Bethesda, MD [4T15LM 7450-15]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING [R01EB020666] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by the NIH/NIBIB Grant R01EB020666 and the NLM Training Grant 4T15LM 7450-15 from the National Institutes of Health located in Bethesda, MD.",,20,8,8,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The present work is one of the steps of a broader study to identify standardized protocols to evaluate the health information systems as medicines and medical devices are evaluated by clinical trials. The goal of the present work was to evaluate the effect of the introduction of an information system for monitoring tuberculosis treatment (SISTB) in a Brazilian municipality from the patients' perspective. The Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems were answered by the patients before and after the SISTB introduction, for comparison. Patients from an outpatient clinic, formed the control group, that is, at this site was not implanted the SISTB. Descriptive statistics and mixed effects model were used for data analysis. Eighty-eight interviews were conducted in the study. The questionnaire's results presented better averages after the system introduction but were not considered statistically significant. Therefore, it was not possible to associate system implantation with improved patient satisfaction. The HIS evaluation need be complete, the technical and managerial evaluation, the safety, the impact on the professionals and direct and/or indirect impact on patients are important.

This study proposes to use the bio-inspired method of practical swarm optimization (PSO) which automatically select the exclusive features that contain the novel android debug bridge (ADB). This study also adopts boosting (adaboost, realadaboost, logitboost, and multiboost) to enhance the machine learning prediction that detects unknown root exploit, and scrutinized three categories of features including (1) system command, (2) directory path and (3) code-based. The evaluation gathered from this study suggests a marked accuracy value of 93% with Logitboost in the simulation. Logitboost also helped to predicted all the root exploit samples in our developed system, the root exploit detection system (RODS).","[Firdaus, Ahmad; Ab Razak, Mohd Faizal; Bachok, Syafiq] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Comp Syst & Software Engn, Kuantan 26300, Pahang, Malaysia; [Anuar, Nor Badrul; Ab Razak, Mohd Faizal; Bachok, Syafiq] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Syst & Technol, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Hashem, Ibrahim Abaker Targio] Taylors Univ, Sch Comp & IT, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, Malaysia; [Sangaiah, Arun Kumar] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India","Sangaiah, AK (corresponding author), Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India.",firdausza@ump.edu.my; badrul@um.edu.my; faizalabrazak@siswa.um.edu.my; targio_123@yahoo.com; syafiqbachok@siswa.um.edu.my; arunkumarsangaiah@gmail.com,", Ahmad/AAH-4337-2019; Firdaus, Ahmad/O-2017-2018; Sangaiah, Arun Kumar/U-6785-2019; Hashem, Ibrahim Abaker Targio/AAP-1204-2020; Anuar, Nor Badrul/B-3101-2010; Razak, Mohd Faizal Ab/O-2027-2018",", Ahmad/0000-0002-7116-2643; Sangaiah, Arun Kumar/0000-0002-0229-2460; Hashem, Ibrahim Abaker Targio/0000-0001-7611-9540; Anuar, Nor Badrul/0000-0003-4380-5303; Ab Razak, Mohd Faizal/0000-0002-7388-4340","Universiti Malaysia Pahang, under the Grant Faculty of Computer Systems and Software Engineering [FSK1000, RDU180360]","This work was supported by Universiti Malaysia Pahang, under the Grant Faculty of Computer Systems and Software Engineering (FSK1000), RDU180360.",,89,23,23,6,100,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In a typical classification problem, information fusion is a process whereby the effective combination of the data can achieve a more accurate system. The purpose of this article was to provide an accurate algorithm for classifying HRV signals in various psychological states. Therefore, a novel feature level fusion approach was proposed. First, using the theory of information, two similarity indicators of the signal were extracted, including correntropy and Cauchy-Schwarz divergence. Applying probabilistic neural network (PNN) and k-nearest neighbor (kNN), the performance of each index in the classification of meditators and non-meditators HRV signals was appraised. Then, three fusion rules, including division, product, and weighted sum rules were used to combine the information of both similarity measures. For the first time, we propose an algorithm to define the weights of each feature based on the statistical p-values. The performance of HRV classification using combined features was compared with the non-combined features. Totally, the accuracy of 100% was obtained for discriminating all states. The results showed the strong ability and proficiency of division and weighted sum rules in the improvement of the classifier accuracies.","[Goshvarpour, Ateke; Goshvarpour, Atefeh] Sahand Univ Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Fac Elect Engn, Tabriz, Iran; [Goshvarpour, Atefeh] Khayyam Blvd,Khayyam 20,54, Mashhad, Khorasan Razavi, Iran","Goshvarpour, A (corresponding author), Sahand Univ Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Fac Elect Engn, Tabriz, Iran.;Goshvarpour, A (corresponding author), Khayyam Blvd,Khayyam 20,54, Mashhad, Khorasan Razavi, Iran.",ak_goshvarpour@sut.ac.ir; af_goshvarpour@sut.ac.ir,"Goshvarpour, Atefeh/AAC-3145-2020; Goshvarpour, Ateke/AAB-5275-2019","Goshvarpour, Atefeh/0000-0002-0343-4344; Goshvarpour, Ateke/0000-0002-5185-5645",,,,36,14,14,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

However, it is not easy to accurately and automatically recognize physical human activity through wearable sensors due to the complexity and variety of body activities. In this paper, we address the human activity recognition problem as a classification problem using wearable body sensor data. In particular, we propose to utilize a Deep Belief Network (DBN) model for successful human activity recognition. First, we extract the important initial features from the raw body sensor data. Then, a kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are performed to further process the features and make them more robust to be useful for fast activity recognition. Finally, the DBN is trained by these features. Various experiments were performed on a real-world wearable sensor dataset to verify the effectiveness of the deep learning algorithm. The results show that the proposed DBN outperformed other algorithms and achieves satisfactory activity recognition performance.","[Hassan, Mohammad Mehedi; Almogren, Ahmad; Alrubaian, Majed] King Saud Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Chia Pervas & Mobile Comp, Riyadh 11543, Saudi Arabia; [Hassan, Mohammad Mehedi] King Saud Univ, Informat Syst Dept, Riyadh 11543, Saudi Arabia; [Huda, Shamsul] Deakin Univ, Sch IT, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Uddin, Md Zia] Univ Oslo, Dept Informat, Oslo, Norway","Hassan, MM (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Chia Pervas & Mobile Comp, Riyadh 11543, Saudi Arabia.;Hassan, MM (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Informat Syst Dept, Riyadh 11543, Saudi Arabia.",mmhassan@ksu.edu.sa; shamsul.huda@deakin.edu.au; mdzu@ifi.uio.no; ahalmogren@ksu.edu.sa; malrubaian@ksu.edu.sa,"Hassan, Mohammad Mehedi/D-4946-2016","Hassan, Mohammad Mehedi/0000-0002-3479-3606; Almogren, Ahmad/0000-0002-8253-9709",King Saud University,This paper was fully financially supported by King Saud University through the Vice Deanship of Research Chairs: Chair of Pervasive and Mobile Computing.,,38,53,53,3,56,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

We used a total of 117 images from Leishman stained peripheral blood smears acquired at a magnification of 100X. In this paper we present a robust image processing algorithm for detection of nuclei and classification of white blood cells based on features of the nuclei. We used novel image enhancement method to manage illumination variations and TissueQuant method to manage color variations for the detection of nuclei. Dice similarity coefficient of 0.95 was obtained for nucleus detection. We also compared the proposed method with a state-of-the-art method and the proposed method was found to be better. Shape and texture features of the detected nuclei were used for classifying white blood cells. We considered classification of WBCs using two approaches such as 5-class and cell-by-cell approaches using neural network and hybrid-classifier respectively. We compared the results of both the approaches for classification of white blood cells. Cell-by-cell approach offered 1.4% higher sensitivity in comparison with the 5-class approach. We obtained an accuracy of 100% for lymphocyte and basophil detection. Hence, we conclude that lymphocytes and basophils can be accurately detected even when the analysis is limited to the features of nuclei whereas, accurate detection of other types of WBCs will require analysis of the cytoplasm too.","[Hegde, Roopa B.; Prasad, Keerthana; Hebbar, Harishchandra] MAHE, Sch Informat Sci, Manipal 576104, Karnataka, India; [Singh, Brij Mohan Kumar] MAHE, Kasturba Med Coll, Dept Pathol, Manipal 574106, Karnataka, India","Prasad, K (corresponding author), MAHE, Sch Informat Sci, Manipal 576104, Karnataka, India.",roopabhegde@gmail.com; keerthana.prasad@manipal.edu; harish.hebbar@manipal.edu; brijmkuar@yahoo.co.in,,"Singh, Brij Mohan Kumar/0000-0001-6891-9302; Hegde, Roopa B/0000-0002-7152-3971",,,,23,22,22,0,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

A total of 116 eyes with PACS underwent LPI and time-domain ASOCT scans (temporal and nasal cuts) were performed before and 1 month after LPI. All the post-treatment scans were classified to one of the following categories: (a) both angles open, (b) one of two angles open and (c) both angles closed. After LPI, success is defined as one or more angles changed from close to open. In this proposed method, the pre and post-LPI ASOCT scans were registered at the corresponding angles based on similarities between the respective local descriptor features and random sample consensus technique was used to identify the largest consensus set of correspondences between the pre and post-LPI ASOCT scans. Subsequently, features such as correlation co-efficient (CC) and structural similarity index (SSIM) were extracted and correlated with the success of LPI. We included 116 eyes and 91 (78.44%) eyes fulfilled the criteria for success after LPI. Using the CC and SSIM index scores from this training set of ASOCT images, our algorithm showed that the success of LPI in eyes with narrow angles can be predicted with 89.7% accuracy, specificity of 95.2% and sensitivity of 36.4% based on pre-LPI ASOCT scans only. Using pre-LPI ASOCT scans, our proposed algorithm showed good accuracy in predicting the success of LPI for PACS eyes. This fully-automated algorithm could aid decision making in offering LPI as a prophylactic treatment for PACS.","[Koh, Victor; Aquino, Maria Cecilia D.; Chew, Paul T.; Sng, Chelvin] Natl Univ Singapore Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Singapore 119074, Singapore; [Swamidoss, Issac Niwas] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Sng, Chelvin] Singapore Eye Res Inst, Singapore 168751, Singapore; [Sng, Chelvin] Moorfields Eye Hosp, Dept Glaucoma, London, England","Sng, C (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Singapore 119074, Singapore.;Sng, C (corresponding author), Singapore Eye Res Inst, Singapore 168751, Singapore.;Sng, C (corresponding author), Moorfields Eye Hosp, Dept Glaucoma, London, England.",viktorkoh@gmail.com; issacniwas@gmail.com; mcdaquino@gmail.com; paul_chew@nuhs.edu.sg; chelvin@gmail.com,"Swamidoss, Issac Niwas/AAZ-1920-2020","Sng, Chelvin/0000-0002-9837-6019",National Medical Research Council New Investigator Grant [NIG10Nov019]; National Medical Research Council Clinician-Scientist Individual Research Grant New Investigator Grant [CNIG14Nov017],This work was supported by (1) National Medical Research Council New Investigator Grant No: NIG10Nov019 and (2) National Medical Research Council Clinician-Scientist Individual Research Grant New Investigator Grant No: CNIG14Nov017.,,51,3,4,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The device has been widely used to detect and monitor the patient's heart rate. The data collected hence has the highest authenticity assurance and is convenient for further electric stimulation. In the pacemaker, ECG detector is one of the most important element. The device is available in its new digital form, which is more efficient and accurate in performance with the added advantage of economical power consumption platform. In this work, a joint algorithm based on biorthogonal wavelet transform and run-length encoding (RLE) is proposed for QRS complex detection of the ECG signal and compressing the detected ECG data. Biorthogonal wavelet transform of the input ECG signal is first calculated using a modified demand based filter bank architecture which consists of a series combination of three lowpass filters with a highpass filter. Lowpass and highpass filters are realized using a linear phase structure which reduces the hardware cost of the proposed design approximately by 50%. Then, the location of the R-peak is found by comparing the denoised ECG signal with the threshold value. The proposed R-peak detector achieves the highest sensitivity and positive predictivity of 99.75 and 99.98 respectively with the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Also, the proposed R-peak detector achieves a comparatively low data error rate (DER) of 0.002. The use of RLE for the compression of detected ECG data achieves a higher compression ratio (CR) of 17.1. To justify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the results have been compared with the existing methods, like Huffman coding/simple predictor, Huffman coding/adaptive, and slope predictor/fixed length packaging.","[Kumar, Ashish; Kumar, Manjeet; Komaragiri, Rama] Bennett Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Greater Noida 201308, UP, India","Kumar, M (corresponding author), Bennett Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Greater Noida 201308, UP, India.",akumar.1june@gmail.com; manjeetchhillar@gmail.com; rama.komaragiri@bennett.edu.in,"Kumar, Manjeet/K-1325-2015; Komaragiri, Rama/AAH-8327-2020","Kumar, Manjeet/0000-0001-6578-9741; Komaragiri, Rama/0000-0002-0468-8506",,,,39,21,21,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

We obtain three months of PPG-based heart rate data from subjects with and without hypertension, and calculate the HRV based on various forms of time and frequency domain analysis. We then apply a data mining technique to this estimated HRV data, to see if it is possible to correctly identify patients with hypertension.

This is a cross-sectional study involving medical students in all phases of education. Sociodemographic data, type and frequency of smartphone use, degree of digital addiction (Internet Addiction Test - IAT), and surface and deep approaches to learning (Biggs) were analyzed. A total of 710 students were included. Almost all students had a smartphone and a total of 96.8% used it during lectures, classes, and meetings. Less than half of the students (47.3%) reported using a smartphone for more than 10 min for educational purposes, a usage that is higher among clerkship students. At least 95% reported using a smartphone in the classroom for activities not related to medicine (social media and searching for general information) and 68.2% were considered problematic Internet users according to the IAT. The most common reasons for noneducational use were that the class was uninteresting, students needed to receive or make an important call, and the educational strategy was not stimulating. The frequency of smartphone use and higher internet addiction were correlated to both higher levels of surface learning and lower levels of deep learning.

On the one hand, this attempts to give meaning to the increasing life expectancy, as living above a certain threshold of pain and lack of autonomy or mobility is both degrading and unfair. On the other hand, it lowers the cost of continuous care, as individuals with high quality of life indexes tend to have lower hospital readmissions or secondary complications, not to mention higher physical and mental health.

Integrating WBAN in a heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem would enable an AP to monitor patients from anywhere and at anytime. However, the IoT roadmap of interconnected 'Things' is still faced with many challenges. One of the challenges in healthcare is security and privacy of streamed medical data from heterogeneously networked devices. In this paper, we first propose a heterogeneous signcryption scheme where a sender is in a certificateless cryptographic (CLC) environment while a receiver is in identity-based cryptographic (IBC) environment. We then use this scheme to design a heterogeneous access control protocol. Formal security proof for indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack and unforgeability against adaptive chosen message attack in random oracle model is presented. In comparison with some of the existing access control schemes, our scheme has lower computation and communication cost.","[Omala, Anyembe Andrew; Li, Fagen] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Ctr Cyber Secur, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Mbandu, Angolo Shem] South Eastern Kenya Univ, Sch Informat & Comunicat Technol, Kitui, Kenya; [Mutiria, Kamenyi Domenic] Kenya Natl Audit Off, Nairobi, Kenya; [Jin, Chunhua] Huaiyin Inst Technol, Lab Internet Things & Mobile Internet Technol Jia, Huaian 223003, Peoples R China","Li, FG (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Ctr Cyber Secur, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",andromala@gmail.com; asmbandu@seku.ac.ke; dkamenyi@yahoo.co.uk; xajch0206@163.com; fagenli@uestc.edu.cn,"Li, Fagen/I-3523-2015","Li, Fagen/0000-0001-6289-1265",National Natural Science Foundation of China [612725 25]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [ZYGX2016J081]; Laboratory for Internet of Things and Mobile Internet Technology of Jiangsu Province [JSWLW2017-006],"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No 612725 25), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. ZYGX2016J081) and the Laboratory for Internet of Things and Mobile Internet Technology of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. JSWLW2017-006).",,41,33,34,5,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The purpose of this investigation is to not only to integrate an alert framework into the electronic heath record system. but also to formulate a modeling method of this knowledge. A trial alert framework was developed for the staff in various occupational categories at the UMH. Based on findings of subsequent interviews, a more detailed and upgraded alert framework was constructed, resulting in the final model. Based on our current findings, an alert framework was developed with four major items. Based on the analysis of the medical practices from the trial model, it has been concluded that there are four major risk patterns that trigger the alert.

Finalized resource planning was necessary for the merging of facilities to optimize staffing and make final equipment selections to support the nearly 33,000 annual endoscopy cases. To accomplish this, we employed operations management methodologies, analyzing the physical process flow of scopes throughout the existing Endoscopy Suite and ORs and mapping the future state capacity of the new reprocessing facility. Further, our analysis required the incorporation of historical case and reprocessing volumes in a multi-server queuing model to identify any potential wait times as a result of the new reprocessing cycle. We also performed sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of future case volume growth. We found that our future-state reprocessing facility, given planned capital expenditures for automated endoscope reprocessors (AERs) and pre-processing sinks, could easily accommodate current scope volume well within the necessary pre-cleaning-to-sink reprocessing time limit recommended by manufacturers. Further, in its current planned state, our model suggested that the future endoscope reprocessing suite at MGH could support an increase in volume of at least 90% over the next several years. Our work suggests that with simple mathematical analysis of historic case data, significant changes to a complex perioperative environment can be made with ease while keeping patient safety as the top priority.","[Seelen, Mark T.; Friend, Tynan H.; Levine, Wilton C.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Perioperat Serv, White 400, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Seelen, MT (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Perioperat Serv, White 400, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",mseelen@mgh.harvard.edu,,"Friend, Tynan/0000-0003-2556-7524",,,,23,1,1,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

A CNN model was designed with six optimized convolution layers including activation, pooling, and dropout layers. One-dimensional (1D) convolution, rectified linear units (ReLU), and max pooling were applied to the convolution, activation, and pooling layers, respectively. For training and evaluation of the CNN model, a single-lead ECG dataset was collected from 82 subjects with OSA and was divided into training (including data from 63 patients with 34,281 events) and testing (including data from 19 patients with 8571 events) datasets. Using this CNN model, a precision of 0.99%, a recall of 0.99%, and an F-1-score of 0.99% were attained with the training dataset; these values were all 0.96% when the CNN was applied to the testing dataset. These results show that the proposed CNN model can be used to detect OSA accurately on the basis of a single-lead ECG. Ultimately, this CNN model may be used as a screening tool for those suspected to suffer from OSA.","[Urtnasan, Erdenebayar; Park, Jong-Uk; Lee, Kyoung-Joung] Yonsei Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Coll Hlth Sci, 1 Yeonsedae Gil, Wonju 26493, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Joo, Eun-Yeon] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Med, Samsung Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Seoul, South Korea","Lee, KJ (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Coll Hlth Sci, 1 Yeonsedae Gil, Wonju 26493, Gangwon Do, South Korea.",lkj5809@yonsei.ac.kr,"Erdenebayar, Urtnasan/AAC-9619-2020",,National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education; Local Innovative Creative Human Resource Training Project [NRF-2014H1C1A1063845],This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Ministry of Education.

To manually create semantic metadata for medical images is time-consuming, yet it is a crucial component for query expansion. We proposed a new method for searching medical image notes that uses semantic metadata to improve query expansion and leverages a knowledge model developed specifically for the medical image domain to create relevant metadata. We used a syntactic parser and the Unified Medical Language System to analyze the corpus and store text information as semantic metadata in a knowledge model. Our new method has an interactive interface that allows users to provide relevance feedback and construct new queries more efficiently. Sixteen medical professionals evaluated the query expansion module, and each evaluator had prior experience searching for medical images. When using the initial query as the baseline standard, expanded queries achieved a performance boost of 22.6% in terms of the relevance score on first ten results (P-value<0.05). When using Google as another baseline, our system performed 24.6% better in terms of relevance score on the first ten results (P-value<0.05). Overall, 75% of the evaluators said the semantic-enhanced query expansion workflow is logical, easy to follow, and comfortable to use. In addition, 62% of the evaluators preferred using our system instead of Google. Evaluators who were positive about our system found the knowledge map-based visualization of candidate medical search terms helpful in refining cases from the initial search results.","[Zhao, Yiqing; Fesharaki, Nooshin J.; Patrick, Timothy B.; Luo, Jake] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Hlth Sci, Ctr Biomed Data & Language Proc, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Li, Xiaohui] ChengDe Petr Coll, Chengde, Peoples R China","Luo, JK (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Coll Hlth Sci, Ctr Biomed Data & Language Proc, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",zhao45@uwm.edu; jafarif2@uwm.edu; xiaohui9702@163.com; tp5@uwm.edu; jakeluo@uwm.edu,"Zhao, Yiqing/AEL-5533-2022","Zhao, Yiqing/0000-0003-2874-8136; Luo, Jake/0000-0002-3900-643X",GE Catalyst Grant and UWM Research Foundation [133PRJ89RA] Funding Source: Medline,,,21,2,2,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Most of the available therapeutic options are based on active exercises and on motor and attentional inclusion of the affected arm in task oriented movements. However, active movements may not be possible after severe impairment of the upper limbs. Different techniques, such as mirror therapy, motor imagery, and non-invasive brain stimulation have been shown to elicit cortical activity in absence of movements, which could be used to preserve the available neural circuits and promote motor learning. We present a virtual reality-based paradigm for upper limb rehabilitation that allows for interaction of individuals with restricted movements from active responses triggered when they attempt to perform a movement. The experimental system also provides multisensory stimulation in the visual, auditory, and tactile channels, and transcranial direct current stimulation coherent to the observed movements. A feasibility study with a chronic stroke survivor with severe hemiparesis who seemed to reach a rehabilitation plateau after two years of its inclusion in a physical therapy program showed clinically meaningful improvement of the upper limb function after the experimental intervention and maintenance of gains in both the body function and activity. The experimental intervention also was reported to be usable and motivating.

With no satisfying prior solutions for matching ICD-10 code sequences, this paper presents a method which effectively captures the clinical similarity among routine patients who have multiple comorbidities and complex care needs. Our method leverages the recent progress in representation learning of individual ICD-10 codes, and it explicitly uses the sequential order of codes for matching. Empirical evaluation on a state-wide cancer data collection shows that our proposed method achieves significantly higher matching performance compared with state-of-the-art methods ignoring the sequential order. Our method better identifies similar patients in a number of clinical outcomes including readmission and mortality outlook. Although this paper focuses on ICD-10 diagnosis code sequences, our method can be adapted to work with other codified sequence data.","[Dang Nguyen; Luo, Wei; Venkatesh, Svetha; Dinh Phung] Deakin Univ, Ctr Pattern Recognit & Data Analyt, Sch Informat Technol, Geelong, Vic, Australia","Nguyen, D (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Ctr Pattern Recognit & Data Analyt, Sch Informat Technol, Geelong, Vic, Australia.",d.nguyen@deakin.edu.au; wei.luo@deakin.edu.au; svetha.venkatesh@deakin.edu.au; dinh.phung@deakin.edu.au,"Nguyen, Dang/AAW-8823-2021; Luo, Wei/A-6043-2011","Luo, Wei/0000-0002-4711-7543; venkatesh, svetha/0000-0001-8675-6631; Nguyen, Dang/0000-0002-0401-988X; Phung, Dinh/0000-0002-9977-8247",Telstra-Deakin Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Big Data and Machine Learning; Australian Research Council (ARC),This work is partially supported by the Telstra-Deakin Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Big Data and Machine Learning.

Here, we developed a smart mobile data module for the remote acquisition and transmission (via a Wi-Fi or 4G connection) of FHR recordings, together with a web-based viewer for displaying the FHR datasets on a computer, smartphone or tablet. In order to define the features required by users, we modelled the fetal monitoring procedure (in home and hospital settings) via semi-structured interviews with midwives and obstetricians. Using this information, we developed a mobile data transfer module based on a Raspberry Pi. When connected to a standalone fetal monitor, the module acquires the FHR signal and sends it (via a Wi-Fi or a 3G/4G mobile internet connection) to a secure server within our hospital information system. The archived, digitized signal data are linked to the patient's electronic medical records. An HTML5/JavaScript web viewer converts the digitized FHR data into easily readable and interpretable graphs for viewing on a computer (running Windows, Linux or MacOS) or a mobile device (running Android, iOS or Windows PhoneOS). The data can be viewed in real time or offline. The application includes tools required for correct interpretation of the data (signal loss calculation, scale adjustment, and precise measurements of the signal's characteristics). We performed a proof-of-concept case study of the transmission, reception and visualization of FHR data for a pregnant woman at 30 weeks of amenorrhea. She was hospitalized in the pregnancy assessment unit and FHR data were acquired three times a day with a Philips Avalon (R) FM30 fetal monitor. The prototype (Raspberry Pi) was connected to the fetal monitor's RS232 port. The emission and reception of prerecorded signals were tested and the web server correctly received the signals, and the FHR recording was visualized in real time on a computer, a tablet and smartphones (running Android and iOS) via the web viewer. This process did not perturb the hospital's computer network. There was no data delay or loss during a 60-min test. The web viewer was tested successfully in the various usage situations. The system was as user-friendly as expected, and enabled rapid, secure archiving. We have developed a system for the acquisition, transmission, recording and visualization of RCF data. Healthcare professionals can view the FHR data remotely on their computer, tablet or smartphone. Integration of FHR data into a hospital information system enables optimal, secure, long-term data archiving.","[de l'Aulnoit, Agathe Houze; Genin, Michael; Gautier, Pierre-Francois; Schiro, Jessica; Beuscart, Regis] Univ Nord France, F-59000 Lille, France; [de l'Aulnoit, Agathe Houze; Genin, Michael; Beuscart, Regis] CHU Lille, UDSL EA2694, F-59000 Lille, France; [de l'Aulnoit, Agathe Houze; de l'Aulnoit, Denis Houze] Lille Catholic Univ, Lille Catholic Hosp, Obstet Dept, F-59020 Lille, France; [Boudet, Samuel] Lille Catholic Univ, Biomed Signal Proc Unit UTSB, F-59800 Lille, France; [Gautier, Pierre-Francois; Schiro, Jessica] CHU Lille, INSERM, CIC 1403, F-59000 Lille, France","de l'Aulnoit, AH (corresponding author), Univ Nord France, F-59000 Lille, France.;de l'Aulnoit, AH (corresponding author), CHU Lille, UDSL EA2694, F-59000 Lille, France.;de l'Aulnoit, AH (corresponding author), Lille Catholic Univ, Lille Catholic Hosp, Obstet Dept, F-59020 Lille, France.",ahouzedelaulnoit@yahoo.fr,"Genin, Michael/O-3639-2019; Genin, Michael/P-5423-2014","Genin, Michael/0000-0002-9098-7528; Genin, Michael/0000-0002-9098-7528; Boudet, Samuel/0000-0002-5289-8591; Houze de l'Aulnoit, Agathe/0000-0003-4770-9271",French government's AVIESAN research program on smart devices [2016-017]; BlueGriot SAS,"This project was funded by the French government's AVIESAN research program on smart devices (No 2016-017), with BlueGriot SAS as an industrial partner.",,20,9,9,2,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The reliability models are restricted to using particular types of methodologies and restricted number of parameters. There are a number of techniques and methodologies that may be used for reliability prediction. There is need to focus on parameters consideration while estimating reliability. The reliability of a system may increase or decreases depending on the selection of different parameters used. Thus there is need to identify factors that heavily affecting the reliability of the system. In present days, reusability is mostly used in the various area of research. Reusability is the basis of Component-Based System (CBS). The cost, time and human skill can be saved using Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) concepts. CBSE metrics may be used to assess those techniques which are more suitable for estimating system reliability. Soft computing is used for small aswell as large-scale problemswhere it is difficult to find accurate results due to uncertainty or randomness. Several possibilities are available to apply soft computing techniques in medicine related problems. Clinical science of medicine using fuzzy-logic, neural network methodology significantly while basic science of medicine using neural-networks-genetic algorithm most frequently and preferably. There is unavoidable interest shown bymedical scientists to use the various soft computingmethodologies in genetics, physiology, radiology, cardiology and neurology discipline. CBSE boost users to reuse the past and existing software for making new products to provide quality with a saving of time, memory space, and money. This paper focused on assessment of commonly used soft computing technique like Genetic Algorithm (GA), Neural-Network (NN), Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). This paper presents working of soft computing techniques and assessment of soft computing techniques to predict reliability. The parameter considered while estimating and prediction of reliability are also discussed. This study can be used in estimation and prediction of the reliability of various instruments used in the medical system, software engineering, computer engineering and mechanical engineering also. These concepts can be applied to both software and hardware, to predict the reliability using CBSE.","[Diwaker, Chander] Kurukshetra Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kurukshetra, Haryana, India; [Tomar, Pradeep] Gautam Buddha Univ, Sch ICT, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Greater Noida, UP, India; [Poonia, Ramesh C.; Singh, Vijander] Amity Univ, Amity Inst Informat Technol, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India","Singh, V (corresponding author), Amity Univ, Amity Inst Informat Technol, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.",chander_cd@rediffmail.com; parry.tomar@gmail.com; rameshcpoonia@gmail.com; vijan2005@gmail.com,"Poonia, Ramesh Chandra/F-2905-2015; Singh, Vijander/ABY-7955-2022","Poonia, Ramesh Chandra/0000-0001-8054-2405; Singh, Vijander/0000-0001-8704-0520",,,,60,8,8,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The proposed method involves four phases. In the first phase, EEG signal is segmented into overlapping time segments and bandpass filtered through frequency filter bank of variable size subbands. In the next phase, features are extracted from the segmented and filtered data using stationary common spatial pattern technique (SCSP) that can handle the non-stationarity and artifacts of EEG signal. The univariate feature selection method is used to obtain a relevant subset of features in the third phase. In the final phase, the classifier is used to build adecision model. In this paper, four univariate feature selection methods such as Euclidean distance, correlation, mutual information and Fisher discriminant ratio and two well-known classifiers (LDA and SVM) are investigated. The proposed method has been validated using the publicly available BCI competition IV dataset Ia and BCI Competition III dataset IVa.

About 8.8% of the world was diabetic in 2017. It is projected that this will reach nearly 10% by 2045. The major challenge is that when machine learning-based classifiers are applied to such data sets for risk stratification, leads to lower performance. Thus, our objective is to develop an optimized and robust machine learning (ML) system under the assumption that missing values or outliers if replaced by a median configuration will yield higher risk stratification accuracy. This ML-based risk stratification is designed, optimized and evaluated, where: (i) the features are extracted and optimized from the six feature selection techniques (random forest, logistic regression, mutual information, principal component analysis, analysis of variance, and Fisher discriminant ratio) and combined with ten different types of classifiers (linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, naive Bayes, Gaussian process classification, support vector machine, artificial neural network, Adaboost, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest) under the hypothesis that both missing values and outliers when replaced by computed medians will improve the risk stratification accuracy. Pima Indian diabetic dataset (768 patients: 268 diabetic and 500 controls) was used. Our results demonstrate that on replacing the missing values and outliers by group median and median values, respectively and further using the combination of random forest feature selection and random forest classification technique yields an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and area under the curve as: 92.26%, 95.96%, 79.72%, 91.14%, 91.20%, and 0.93, respectively. This is an improvement of 10% over previously developed techniques published in literature. The system was validated for its stability and reliability. RF-based model showed the best performance when outliers are replaced by median values.","[Maniruzzaman, Md; Rahman, Md Jahanur] Univ Rajshahi, Dept Stat, Rajshahi, Bangladesh; [Maniruzzaman, Md] Johns Hopkins Univ, JiVitA Project, Gaibandha, Bangladesh; [Al-MehediHasan, Md] Rajshahi Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Rajshahi, Bangladesh; [Suri, Harman S.] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Abedin, Md Menhazul] Khulna Univ, Stat Discipline, Khulna, Bangladesh; [El-Baz, Ayman] Univ Louisville, Dept Bioengn, Louisville, KY 40292 USA; [Suri, Jasjit S.] AtheroPoint LLC, Stroke Monitoring & Diagnost Div, Roseville, CA 95661 USA; [Suri, Jasjit S.] Global Biomed Technol, Knowledge Engn Ctr, Roseville, CA 95741 USA","Suri, JS (corresponding author), AtheroPoint LLC, Stroke Monitoring & Diagnost Div, Roseville, CA 95661 USA.;Suri, JS (corresponding author), Global Biomed Technol, Knowledge Engn Ctr, Roseville, CA 95741 USA.",jasjit.suri@atheropoint.com,"Maniruzzaman, Md/R-2123-2019; El-Baz, Ayman/AAC-6689-2019","Maniruzzaman, Md/0000-0001-6151-8071; El-Baz, Ayman/0000-0001-7264-1323",,,,40,82,83,2,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

While extensively used for cost adjustment, no study has compared the APR-DRG subclass modifiers to the popular Charlson Comorbidity Index as a measure of comorbidity severity in models for perioperative in-hospital mortality. In this study we attempt to validate the use of these subclasses to predict mortality in a cohort of surgical patients. We analyzed all adult (age over 18 years) inpatient non-cardiac surgery at our institution between December 2005 and July 2013. After exclusions, we split the cohort into training and validation sets. We created prediction models of inpatient mortality using the Charlson Comorbidity Index, ROM only, SOI only, and ROM with SOI. Models were compared by receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and Brier score. After exclusions, we analyzed 63,681 patient-visits. Overall in-hospital mortality was 1.3%. The median number of ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes was 6 (Q1-Q3 4-10). The median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 0 (Q1-Q3 0-2). When the model was applied to the validation set, the c-statistic for Charlson was 0.865, c-statistic for ROM was 0.975, and for ROM and SOI combined the c-statistic was 0.977. The scaled Brier score for Charlson was 0.044, Brier for ROM only was 0.230, and Brier for ROM and SOI was 0.257. The APR-DRG ROM or SOI subclasses are better predictors than the Charlson Comorbidity Index of in-hospital mortality among surgical patients.","[McCormick, Patrick J.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Lin, Hung-mo] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Populat Hlth Sci & Policy, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Lin, Hung-mo; Deiner, Stacie G.; Levin, Matthew A.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Deiner, Stacie G.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Neurosurg, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Deiner, Stacie G.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Geriatr & Palliat Care, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Levin, Matthew A.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Genet & Genom Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA","McCormick, PJ (corresponding author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.",mccormp1@mskcc.org; hungmo.lin@mountsinai.org; stacie.deiner@mountsinai.org; matthew.levin@mountsinai.org,,,NCI NIH HHS [P30 CA008748] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE [P30CA008748] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,,,24,54,55,1,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The aim of this article is to identify in the literature the strengths and weaknesses of this technology, as well as barriers to and facilitators of its implementation. A systematic review of systematic reviews was performed using PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library and the Center for Reviews and Dissemination through August 2017. The gray literature has also been consulted. The quality of systematic reviews has been assessed with the AMSTAR checklist. The main inclusion criterion was use of speech recognition for medical reporting (front-end or back-end). A survey has also been conducted in Quebec, Canada, to identify the dissemination of this technology in this province, as well as the factors leading to the success or failure of its implementation. Five systematic reviews were identified. These reviews indicated a high level of heterogeneity across studies. The quality of the studies reported was generally poor. Speech recognition is not as accurate as human transcription, but it can dramatically reduce turnaround times for reporting. In front-end use, medical doctors need to spend more time on dictation and correction than required with human transcription. With speech recognition, major errors occur up to three times more frequently. In back-end use, a potential increase in productivity of transcriptionists was noted. In conclusion, speech recognition offers several advantages for medical reporting. However, these advantages are countered by an increased burden on medical doctors and by risks of additional errors in medical reports. It is also hard to identify for which medical specialties and which clinical activities the use of speech recognition will be the most beneficial.","[Poder, Thomas G.] CHUS, CIUSSS Estrie, UETMIS, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada; [Poder, Thomas G.] CHUS, CIUSSS Estrie, CRCHUS, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada; [Poder, Thomas G.; Dery, Veronique] Univ Sherbrooke, FMSS, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada; [Fisette, Jean-Francois; Dery, Veronique] CHUS, CIUSSS Estrie, UETMIS, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada","Poder, TG (corresponding author), CHUS, CIUSSS Estrie, UETMIS, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada.;Poder, TG (corresponding author), CHUS, CIUSSS Estrie, CRCHUS, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada.;Poder, TG (corresponding author), Univ Sherbrooke, FMSS, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada.",thomas.poder@usherbrooke.ca,,,,,,22,4,4,2,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The performance evaluation (PE) of the ML system is typically driven by the training data size and the partition protocols used. Such systems lead to low accuracy because the text classification systems lack the ability to model the input text data in terms of noise characteristics. This research study proposes a concept of misrepresentation ratio (MRR) on input healthcare text data and models the PE criteria for validating the hypothesis. Further, such a novel system provides a platform to amalgamate several attributes of the ML system such as: data size, classifier type, partitioning protocol and percentage MRR. Our comprehensive data analysis consisted of five types of text data sets (TwitterA, WebKB4, Disease, Reuters (R8), and SMS); five kinds of classifiers (support vector machine with linear kernel (SVM-L), MLP-based neural network, AdaBoost, stochastic gradient descent and decision tree); and five types of training protocols (K2, K4, K5, K10 and JK). Using the decreasing order of MRR, our ML system demonstrates the mean classification accuracies as: 70.13 +/- 0.15%, 87.34 +/- 0.06%, 93.73 +/- 0.03%, 94.45 +/- 0.03% and 97.83 +/- 0.01%, respectively, using all the classifiers and protocols. The corresponding AUC is 0.98 for SMS data using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based neural network. All the classifiers, the best accuracy of 91.84 +/- 0.04% is shown to be of MLP-based neural network and this is 6% better over previously published. Further we observed that as MRR decreases, the system robustness increases and validated by standard deviations. The overall text system accuracy using all data types, classifiers, protocols is 89%, thereby showing the entire ML system to be novel, robust and unique. The system is also tested for stability and reliability.","[Srivastava, Saurabh Kumar; Singh, Sandeep Kumar] JIIT, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Noida, India; [Suri, Jasjit S.] Global Biomed Technol Inc, Adv Knowledge Engn Ctr, Roseville, CA USA","Suri, JS (corresponding author), Global Biomed Technol Inc, Adv Knowledge Engn Ctr, Roseville, CA USA.",phd.jiit@gmail.com; sandeepk.singh@jiit.ac.in; jsuri@comcast.net,"Srivastava, Saurabh Kumar/AAC-2598-2020","Jain, Dr. Arpit/0000-0003-2325-5893; SINGH, SANDEEP KUMAR/0000-0002-2781-8684",,,,32,11,11,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

It determines how an individual thinks, feels and handle situations. Positive mental health helps one to work productively and realize their full potential. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Many factors contribute to mental health problems which lead to mental illness like stress, social anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, drug addiction, and personality disorders. It is becoming increasingly important to determine the onset of the mental illness to maintain proper life balance. The nature of machine learning algorithms and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be fully harnessed for predicting the onset of mental illness. Such applications when implemented in real time will benefit the society by serving as a monitoring tool for individuals with deviant behavior. This research work proposes to apply various machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, decision trees, naive bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbor classifier and logistic regression to identify state of mental health in a target group. The responses obtained from the target group for the designed questionnaire were first subject to unsupervised learning techniques. The labels obtained as a result of clustering were validated by computing the Mean Opinion Score. These cluster labels were then used to build classifiers to predict the mental health of an individual. Population from various groups like high school students, college students and working professionals were considered as target groups. The research presents an analysis of applying the aforementioned machine learning algorithms on the target groups and also suggests directions for future work.","[Srividya, M.; Mohanavalli, S.; Bhalaji, N.] SSN Coll Engn, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India","Mohanavalli, S (corresponding author), SSN Coll Engn, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.",srividhyav@ssn.edu.in; mohanas@ssn.edu.in; bhalajin@ssn.edu.in,"S, Mohanavalli/ABC-6985-2021; natarajan, bhalaji/G-3845-2013","natarajan, bhalaji/0000-0002-2991-3669",,,,49,29,29,7,83,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

However, BIS readings can be subject to interference from many factors during surgery, and other parameters such as blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) can provide more stable indicators. However, anesthesiologist still consider BIS as a primary measure to determine if the patient is correctly anaesthetized while relaying on the other physiological parameters to monitor and ensure the patient's status is maintained. The automatic control of administering anesthesia using intelligent control systems has been the subject of recent research in order to alleviate the burden on the anesthetist to manually adjust drug dosage in response physiological changes for sustaining DOA. A system proposed for the automatic control of anesthesia based on type-2 Self Organizing Fuzzy Logic Controllers (T2-SOFLCs) has been shown to be effective in the control of DOA under simulated scenarios while contending with uncertainties due to signal noise and dynamic changes in pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) effects of the drug on the body. This study considers both BIS and BP as part of an adaptive automatic control scheme, which can adjust to the monitoring of either parameter in response to changes in the availability and reliability of BIS signals during surgery. The simulation of different control schemes using BIS data obtained during real surgical procedures to emulate noise and interference factors have been conducted. The use of either or both combined parameters for controlling the delivery Propofol to maintain safe target set points for DOA are evaluated. The results show that combing BIS and BP based on the proposed adaptive control scheme can ensure the target set points and the correct amount of drug in the body is maintained even with the intermittent loss of BIS signal that could otherwise disrupt an automated control system.","[Yu, Yu-Ning; Shieh, Jiann-Shing] Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Chungli 320, Taiwan; [Yu, Yu-Ning; Shieh, Jiann-Shing] Yuan Ze Univ, Innovat Ctr Big Data & Digital Convergence, Chungli 320, Taiwan; [Doctor, Faiyaz] Univ Essex, Sch Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Fan, Shou-Zen] Natl Taiwan Univ Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, Taipei 100, Taiwan","Shieh, JS (corresponding author), Yuan Ze Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Chungli 320, Taiwan.;Shieh, JS (corresponding author), Yuan Ze Univ, Innovat Ctr Big Data & Digital Convergence, Chungli 320, Taiwan.;Doctor, F (corresponding author), Univ Essex, Sch Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",fdocto@essex.ac.uk; jsshieh@saturn.yzu.edu.tw,,"Doctor, Faiyaz/0000-0002-8412-5489; Fan, Shou-Zen/0000-0002-6849-8453","National Chung-Shan Institute of Science & Technology in Taiwan [CSIST-095-V201, CSIST-095-V202]",This study was funded by National Chung-Shan Institute of Science & Technology in Taiwan (Grant Numbers: CSIST-095-V201 and CSIST-095-V202).,,47,10,10,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Physical analysis of blood tests to recognize leukocytes is tedious, time-consuming and liable to error because of the various morphological components of the cells. Segmentation of medical imagery has been considered as a difficult task because of complexity of images, and also due to the non-availability of leucocytes models which entirely captures the probable shapes in each structures and also incorporate cell overlapping, the expansive variety of the blood cells concerning their shape and size, various elements influencing the outer appearance of the blood leucocytes, and low Static Microscope Image disparity from extra issues outcoming about because of noise. We suggest a strategy towards segmentation of blood leucocytes using static microscope images which is a resultant of three prevailing systems of computer vision fiction: enhancing the image, Support vector machine for segmenting the image, and filtering out non ROI (region of interest) on the basis of Local binary patterns and texture features. Every one of these strategies are modified for blood leucocytes division issue, in this manner the subsequent techniques are very vigorous when compared with its individual segments. Eventually, we assess framework based by compare the outcome and manual division. The findings outcome from this study have shown a new approach that automatically segments the blood leucocytes and identify it from a static microscope images. Initially, the method uses a trainable segmentation procedure and trained support vector machine classifier to accurately identify the position of the ROI. After that, filtering out non ROI have proposed based on histogram analysis to avoid the non ROI and chose the right object. Finally, identify the blood leucocytes type using the texture feature. The performance of the foreseen approach has been tried in appearing differently in relation to the system against manual examination by a gynaecologist utilizing diverse scales. A total of 100 microscope images were used for the comparison, and the results showed that the proposed solution is a viable alternative to the manual segmentation method for accurately determining the ROI. We have evaluated the blood leucocytes identification using the ROI texture (LBP Feature). The identification accuracy in the technique used is about 95.3%., with 100 sensitivity and 91.66% specificity.","[Abdulhay, Enas] Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Irbid, Jordan; [Mohammed, Mazin Abed] Univ Tekn Malaysia Melaka, Fac Informat & Commun Technol, Biomed Comp & Engn Technol BIOCORE Appl Res Grp, Durian Tunggal, Malaysia; [Mohammed, Mazin Abed; Ibrahim, Dheyaa Ahmed] Univ Anbar, Univ Headquarter, Planning & Follow Dept, Anbar, Iraq; [Arunkumar, N.; Venkatraman, V.] Sastra Univ, Thanjavur, India","Abdulhay, E (corresponding author), Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Irbid, Jordan.",ewabdulhay@just.edu.jo; mazin_top_86@yahoo.com; dheyaa.ibrahim88@gmail.com; arun.nura@gmail.com; mathvvr@maths.sastra.edu,"Mohammed, Mazin Abed/E-3910-2018; N, Arunkumar/S-3028-2018; Venkatachalam, Venkataraman/AAG-4422-2019; IbrahiM, Dheyaa Ahmed/AAX-8483-2021","Mohammed, Mazin Abed/0000-0001-9030-8102; Venkatachalam, Venkataraman/0000-0001-6207-6308; ",,,,48,42,42,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The present research aimed to study the effect of combat stress in strength manifestations of leg flexor-extensor muscles and the anaerobic metabolism of soldiers. Before and after asymmetrical combat simulation were analyzed parameters of blood lactate concentration, explosive leg strength manifestation and contractile capacity of leg muscle in 186 professional soldiers. Results showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in blood lactate values (2.23 +/- 0.95 vs 7.47 +/- 3.67 mmol/L), explosive leg strength (Squat Jump 0.31 +/- 0.06 vs 0.35 +/- 0.07 m, Countermovement Jump 0.33 +/- 0.07 vs 0.36 +/- 0.07 m, Abalakov Jump 0.39 +/- 0.08 vs 0.41 +/- 0.09 m), and a significant decrease of the elastic capacity (0.022 +/- 0.04 vs 0.021 +/- 0.04) and recruitment and muscle synchronization capability (0.028 +/- 0.04 vs 0.026 +/- 0.04). This data suggest that combat stress increases the leg strength manifestation despite the significantly increase of muscle acidosis after a combat simulation. This result is probably due to the high activation of the fight-flight system of soldiers which increases the organic response of soldiers and that can compensate the prejudicial effect of acidosis in muscle contraction. These results could be used by officers to improve specific training programs and to improve planning and election of equipment and material for the development of different missions in current theaters of operations.","[Delgado-Moreno, Rosa; Juan Robles-Perez, Jose; Javier Clemente-Suarez, Vicente] Ctr Higher Studies Appl Combat, Toledo, Spain; [Delgado-Moreno, Rosa; Aznar, Susana] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Sports Sci, PAFS Res Grp, Toledo, Spain; [Juan Robles-Perez, Jose] Light Forces Head Quarter Spanish Army, Madrid, Spain; [Javier Clemente-Suarez, Vicente] European Univ Madrid, Appl Psychophysiol Res Grp, Madrid, Spain; [Javier Clemente-Suarez, Vicente] Fac Sport Sci, Dept Motr Human Performance & Sport Management, Calle Tajo S-N, Madrid 28670, Spain","Clemente-Suarez, VJ (corresponding author), Ctr Higher Studies Appl Combat, Toledo, Spain.;Clemente-Suarez, VJ (corresponding author), European Univ Madrid, Appl Psychophysiol Res Grp, Madrid, Spain.;Clemente-Suarez, VJ (corresponding author), Fac Sport Sci, Dept Motr Human Performance & Sport Management, Calle Tajo S-N, Madrid 28670, Spain.",vctxente@yahoo.es,"Aznar, Susana/AAD-9999-2021; Clemente-Suarez, Vicente Javier/K-7980-2014","Clemente-Suarez, Vicente Javier/0000-0002-2397-2801",,,,37,25,25,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

An evaluation matrix is used for emergency evaluation and large-scale data scoring of patients with chronic heart diseases in telemedicine environment. However, one major problem in the emergency evaluation of these patients is establishing a reasonable threshold for patients with the most and least critical conditions. This threshold can be used to detect the highest and lowest priority levels when all the scores of patients are identical during disasters and peak seasons. A practical study was performed on 500 patients with chronic heart diseases and different symptoms, and their emergency levels were evaluated based on four main measurements: electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation sensor, blood pressure monitoring, and non-sensory measurement tool, namely, text frame. Data alignment was conducted for the raw data and decision-making matrix by converting each extracted feature into an integer. This integer represents their state in the triage level based on medical guidelines to determine the features from different sources in a platform. The patients were then scored based on a decision matrix by using multi-criteria decision-making techniques, namely, integrated multi-layer for analytic hierarchy process (MLAHP) and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). For subjective validation, cardiologists were consulted to confirm the ranking results. For objective validation, mean +/- standard deviation was computed to check the accuracy of the systematic ranking. This study provides scenarios and checklist benchmarking to evaluate the proposed and existing prioritization methods. Experimental results revealed the following. (1) The integration of TOPSIS and MLAHP effectively and systematically solved the patient settings on triage and prioritization problems. (2) In subjective validation, the first five patients assigned to the doctors were the most urgent cases that required the highest priority, whereas the last five patients were the least urgent cases and were given the lowest priority. In objective validation, scores significantly differed between the groups, indicating that the ranking results were identical. (3) For the first, second, and third scenarios, the proposed method exhibited an advantage over the benchmark method with percentages of 40%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. In conclusion, patients with the most and least urgent cases received the highest and lowest priority levels, respectively.","[Kalid, Naser; Zaidan, A. A.; Zaidan, B. B.; Hashim, M.; Albahri, O.

This paper proposes a support vector using fusion estimator with a bootstrap technique for oscillometric blood pressure (BP) estimation. However, some inherent problems exist with this approach. First, it is not simple to identify the best support vector regression (SVR) estimator, and worthy information might be omitted when selecting one SVR estimator and discarding others. Additionally, our input feature data, acquired from only five BP measurements per subject, represent a very small sample size. This constitutes a critical limitation when utilizing the SVR technique and can cause overfitting or underfitting, depending on the structure of the algorithm. To overcome these challenges, a fusion with an asymptotic approach (based on combining the bootstrap with the SVR technique) is utilized to generate the pseudo features needed to predict the BP values.

The ongoing publication of systematic and critical literature reviews has contributed to generate a kaleidoscope of guidelines by different scientific organizations. We investigated the accordance among the most popular web-based CVD risk calculators on the Internet. We carried out a simple study, by estimating the risk of CVD using the most popular Internet-based calculators available on the Internet. A Google search was performed, using the keyword cardiovascular risk calculator, to identify the first 10 websites providing free on-line CVD risk calculators. We arbitrarily selected the cardiovascular profile of two subjects of a typical Western family: a 55-year man at a likely intermediate cardiovascular risk and a 45-year woman at a probable low risk. The score calculated according to the two arbitrary CVD risk profiles, one of whom was supposed to be at intermediate risk and the other at lower risk, was extremely variable. More specifically, the 10-year CVD risk of the 55-year old man varied from 3% to over 25% (median value, 12.9%, interquartile range [IQR], 10.7-19.0%), whereas that of the 45-year women varied between 0% and 4% (median value, 1.2%; IQR, 0.4-2.2%), thus displaying a nearly 10-fold variation in both cases. We concluded from our analysis of 11 different Internet-based CVD risk calculators that the final 10-year risk score can be extremely different, especially for the 55-year old man at predictably intermediate risk.","[Lippi, Giuseppe] Univ Verona, Sect Clin Biochem, Verona, Italy; [Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian] NYU, Sch Med, Leon H Charney Div Cardiol, 522 First Ave,Smilow 805, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian] Univ Valencia, Fac Med, Dept Physiol, Valencia, Spain; [Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian] INCLIVA Biomed Res Inst, Valencia, Spain","Sanchis-Gomar, F (corresponding author), NYU, Sch Med, Leon H Charney Div Cardiol, 522 First Ave,Smilow 805, New York, NY 10016 USA.;Sanchis-Gomar, F (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Fac Med, Dept Physiol, Valencia, Spain.;Sanchis-Gomar, F (corresponding author), INCLIVA Biomed Res Inst, Valencia, Spain.",fabian.sanchis@uv.es,"Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian/R-4045-2019; Lippi, Giuseppe/X-7198-2018","Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian/0000-0003-0424-4208; Lippi, Giuseppe/0000-0001-9523-9054",,,,9,5,5,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

We propose a single channel capacitive proximity pressure sensor (TCPS) and gait monitoring system for smart healthcare. Insole-type TCPS (270 mm in length) was designed consisting of three layers including two shield layers and a sensor layer. Analyzing the step count and stride time are the basic indicators in gait analysis, thus they were selected as evaluation indicators. A total of 12 subjects participated in the experiment to evaluate the resolution of our TCPS. To evaluate the accuracy of TCPS, step count and its error rates were simultaneously detected by naked eye, ZIKTO Walk (ZIKTO Co., Korea), and HJ-203-K pedometer (Omron Co., Japan) as reference. Results showed that the error rate of 1.77% in TCPS was lower than those of other devices and correlation coefficient was 0.958 (p-value = 0.000). ZIKTO Walk and pedometer do not provide information on stride time, therefore it was detected by F-scan (Tekscan, USA) to evaluate the performance of TCPS. As a result, error rate of stride time measured by TCPS was found to be 1% and the correlation coefficient was 0.685 (p-value = 0.000). According to these results, our proposed system may be helpful in development of gait monitoring and measurement system as smart healthcare.","[Min, Se Dong; Wang, Changwon] Soonchunhyang Univ, Dept Med IT Engn, 1521,22 Soonchunhyang Ro, Asan 31538, South Korea; [Park, Doo-Soon] Soonchunhyang Univ, Dept Comp Software Engn, M516,22 Soonchunhyang Ro, Asan 31538, South Korea; [Park, Jong Hyuk] Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, SeoulTech, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 01811, South Korea","Park, JH (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ Sci & Technol, SeoulTech, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 01811, South Korea.",sedongmin@sch.ac.kr; changwon@sch.ac.kr; parkds@sch.ac.kr; jhpark1@seoultech.ac.kr,"Min, Dong/O-1002-2013; park, doo-soon/AAM-7730-2020","park, doo-soon/0000-0002-2776-8832; Min, Se Dong/0000-0002-9112-2673",Soonchunhyang University Research Fund,This research was supported by the Soonchunhyang University Research Fund.,,39,9,9,3,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

We explored the frequency of arterial catheter (AC), central venous catheter (CVC) and pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) placement during kidney transplantation in the USA using data from the National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry (NACOR) and assessed the between-facility variation in the frequency of catheter placement. We defined cases of kidney transplantation using Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification Software. Placement of AC, CVC and PAC was defined by respective Current Procedural Terminology codes. The frequency of vascular catheter placement across facility types was compared using Pearson chi(2) test. We identified 10,580 cases of kidney transplantation performed in 100 facilities from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2014. Placement of an AC was reported in 1700 (16.1%), CVC in 2580 (24.4%) and PAC in 50 (0.5%) of cases. The frequency of placement of specific types of catheters was statistically different across facility types (p < 0.001). Within individual facilities that reported at least 50 cases of kidney transplantation, the percentages of cases performed with AC, CVC and PAC ranged from 0% to 86%, 0% to 90% and 0% to 3%, respectively. Considerable between-facility variation in the frequency of AC, CVC and PAC placement during kidney transplantation raises concerns about the need for better practice standardization. Excess invasive monitoring may represent a safety risk as well as unnecessary additional cost. If kidney transplantation can be safely performed without an AC, CVC or PAC in most patients, facilities with above-average catheter placement rates may have an opportunity for measurable reduction in catheter-related perioperative complications. Optimizing perioperative monitoring is an important component of ensuring high functioning, high-value medical systems.","[Nagrebetsky, Alexander] Harvard Med Sch, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Dutton, Richard P.] USAP, Dallas, TX USA; [Ehrenfeld, Jesse M.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Nashville, TN USA; [Urman, Richard D.] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Urman, RD (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",rurman@bwh.harvard.edu,"Urman, Richard/AAH-7758-2019; Urman, Richard/ABG-4830-2020; Ehrenfeld, Jesse/AAI-2951-2020","Urman, Richard/0000-0002-0516-5977; ",,,,21,3,3,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The airflow pattern in tracheobronchial trees of TB subjects is critical, but has not been systemically studied. This study proposes to simulate the airflow using CT image based models and the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. Six TB subjects and three health controls (HC) are included. After the geometric model of tracheobronchial tree is extracted from CT images, the spatial distribution of velocity, wall pressure, wall shear stress (WSS) is obtained through CFD simulation, and the lobar distribution of air, flow pattern and global pressure drop are investigated. Compared with HC subjects, the main bronchus angle of TB subjects and the variation of volume are large, while the cross-sectional growth rate is small. High airflow velocity, wall pressure, and WSS are observed locally at the tracheal bronchus, but the global patterns of these measures are still similar to those of HC. The ratio of airflow into the tracheal bronchus accounts for 6.6-15.6% of the inhaled airflow, decreasing the ratio to the right upper lobe from 15.7-21.4% (HC) to 4.9-13.6%. The air into tracheal bronchus originates from the right dorsal near-wall region of the trachea. Tracheal bronchus does not change the global pressure drop which is dependent on multiple variables. Though the tracheobronchial trees of TB subjects present individualized features, several commonalities on the structural and airflow characteristics can be revealed. The observed local alternations might provide new insight into the reason of recurrent local infections, cough and acute respiratory distress related to TB.","[Qi, Shouliang; Zhang, Baihua; Teng, Yueyang; Qian, Wei] Northeastern Univ, Sino Dutch Biomed & Informat Engn Sch, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Qi, Shouliang; Zhang, Baihua; Teng, Yueyang] Northeastern Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Med Image Comp, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Yue, Yong] China Med Univ, Shengjing Hosp, Dept Radiol, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Shen, Jing; Wu, Jianlin] Dalian Univ, Affiliated Zhongshan Hosp, Dept Radiol, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Qian, Wei] Univ Texas El Paso, Coll Engn, El Paso, TX 79968 USA","Qi, SL (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Sino Dutch Biomed & Informat Engn Sch, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China.;Qi, SL (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Med Image Comp, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",qisl@bmie.neu.edu.cn; 1091379711@qq.com; ghostaa2000@aliyun.com; dsqshenjing2002@163.com; Tengyy@bmie.neu.edu.cn; wqian@bmie.neu.edu.cn; cjr.wujianlin@vip.163.com,"Qian, Wei/B-8231-2013","Qi, Shouliang/0000-0003-0977-1939","National Natural Science Foundation of China [81,671,773, 61,672,146]","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant (Grant number: 81,671,773, 61,672,146).",,40,10,10,3,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Nevertheless, some people may underestimate the importance of getting quality sleep. The standard health care systems might not be suitable for long-term monitoring of sleep. As an example, the polysomnography, i.e., the gold standard for assessing sleep disorders is cumbersome, expensive, and time-consuming. As a result, portable, nonintrusive and inexpensive systems for monitoring quality of sleep are greatly needed. This paper demonstrates a novel nonintrusive system for monitoring quality of sleep using an optical fiber embedded sensor mat. The proposed system is deployed in real-life conditions over a one-month period. Three senior female residents were enrolled for the study, where the sensor mat is placed under the bed mattress. Sleep quality is assessed based on several parameters, such as duration of sleep, sleep interruption, vital signs (heart rate and respiration). The proposed system shows an agreement with a user's survey collected before the study. Furthermore, the system is integrated within an existing ambient assisted living platform with a user-friendly interface to make it more convenient for the caregivers to follow-up the sleep parameters of the residents.","[Sadek, Ibrahim; Mohktari, Mounir] CNRS, UMI 2955, Image & Pervas Access Lab, Singapore, Singapore; [Sadek, Ibrahim; Mohktari, Mounir] Inst Mines Telecom, Paris, France","Sadek, I (corresponding author), CNRS, UMI 2955, Image & Pervas Access Lab, Singapore, Singapore.;Sadek, I (corresponding author), Inst Mines Telecom, Paris, France.",ibrahim.sadek@ipal.cnrs.fr; mounir.mokhtari@ipal.cnrs.fr,"Sadek, Ibrahim/U-4125-2018","Sadek, Ibrahim/0000-0001-8932-8229",,,,26,16,17,4,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

A wide number of local feature detectors and descriptors exist and many of them have already applied for retinal image registration, however, no comparative evaluation has been made so far to analyse their respective performance. In this manuscript we evaluate the performance of the widely known and commonly used detectors such as Harris, SIFT, SURF, BRISK, and bifurcation and cross-over points. As of descriptors SIFT, SURF, ALOHA, BRIEF, BRISK and PIIFD are used. Longitudinal retinal image datasets containing a total of 244 images are used for the experiment. The evaluation reveals some potential findings including more robustness of SURF and SIFT keypoints than the commonly used bifurcation and cross-over points, when detected on the vessels. SIFT keypoints can be detected with a reliability of 59% for without pathology images and 45% for with pathology images. For SURF keypoints these values are respectively 58% and 47%. ALOHA descriptor is best suited to describe SURF keypoints, which ensures an overall matching accuracy, distinguishability of 83%, 93% and 78%, 83% for without pathology and with pathology images respectively.","[Saha, Sajib K.; Xiao, Di; Frost, Shaun; Kanagasingam, Yogesan] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Australian Hlth Res Ctr E, Perth, WA, Australia","Saha, SK (corresponding author), Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Australian Hlth Res Ctr E, Perth, WA, Australia.",Sajib.Saha@csiro.au,"Frost, Shaun M/A-7580-2011","Frost, Shaun M/0000-0002-1681-8224",,,,34,10,10,2,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Results and Conclusion: A combat simulation provokes an alteration of the psycho-physiological basal state in soldiers and a great unbalance in the sympathetic-vagal interaction. The specific training of Light Infantry unit involves lower metabolic, cardiovascular, and anxiogenic response not only previous, but mainly after a combat maneuver, than Heavy Infantry unit's.

We conducted the present research with the aim of to analyse the effect of experience and training in psychophysiological response, attention and memory of soldiers in combat. Variables of blood lactate, blood glucose, blood oxygen saturation, body temperature, heart rate, lower body muscular strength manifestation, autonomic modulation, cortical arousal, cognitive and somatic anxiety, and memory by a post mission questionnaire were analysed before and after a combat simulation in 49 soldiers of Spanish Army. Combat simulation produced a significant increase (p < 0.05) in blood lactate, blood glucose, blood oxygen saturation, rated perceived exertion, heart rate, cognitive and somatic anxiety. Significant increase in low frequency domain and significant decrease in high frequency domain of the heart rate variability was found in experienced and highly trained soldiers. The percentage of correct response in the post mission questionnaire indicated that elements better remembered were those related with soldier integrity and considered as a possible life threat, Significant differences in the post mission questionnaire by experience and training was also found. Correlation analysis showed that higher psychophysiological activation correlated positively with cognitive impairment and lower memory. As a conclusion, higher experienced soldiers presented higher physiological activation as well as cognitive and memory impairment than lower experienced soldier after a combat simulation and memory function was modulated by the stimulus nature.","[Tornero-Aguilera, J.

As the gene expression samples have high dimensionality it becomes tedious to analyze the samples manually. Hence an automated system is needed to analyze these samples. The fuzzy expert system offers a clear classification when compared to the machine learning and statistical methodologies. In fuzzy classification, knowledge acquisition would be a major concern. Despite several existing approaches for knowledge acquisition much effort is necessary to enhance the learning process. This paper proposes an innovative Hybrid Stem Cell (HSC) algorithm that utilizes Ant Colony optimization and Stem Cell algorithm for designing fuzzy classification system to extract the informative rules to form the membership functions from the microarray dataset. The HSC algorithm uses a novel Adaptive Stem Cell Optimization (ASCO) to improve the points of membership function and Ant Colony Optimization to produce the near optimum rule set. In order to extract the most informative genes from the large microarray dataset a method called Mutual Information is used. The performance results of the proposed technique evaluated using the five microarray datasets are simulated. These results prove that the proposed Hybrid Stem Cell (HSC) algorithm produces a precise fuzzy system than the existing methodologies.","[Vijay, S.

It is possible to represent these three-dimensional structures in any spatial orientation, together with sectional images of corpse and magnetic resonance imaging, in the three planes of space (axial, coronal and sagittal) that facilitates the anatomical understanding and the identification of the set of visceral structures of this body region. Actually, there are few studies that analysze in detail the radiological anatomy of the female pelvis using three-dimensional models together with sectional images, making use of open applications for the representation of virtual scenes on low cost Windows (R) platforms.

Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is a process that provides a framework for image search and low-level visual features are commonly used to retrieve the images from the image database. The basic requirement in any image retrieval process is to sort the images with a close similarity in term of visually appearance. The color, shape and texture are the examples of low-level image features. The feature plays a significant role in image processing. The powerful representation of an image is known as feature vector and feature extraction techniques are applied to get features that will be useful in classifying and recognition of images. As features define the behavior of an image, they show its place in terms of storage taken, efficiency in classification and obviously in time consumption also. In this paper, we are going to discuss various types of features, feature extraction techniques and explaining in what scenario, which features extraction technique will be better. The effectiveness of the CBIR approach is fundamentally based on feature extraction. In image processing errands like object recognition and image retrieval feature descriptor is an immense among the most essential step. The main idea of CBIR is that it can search related images to an image passed as query from a dataset got by using distance metrics. The proposed method is explained for image retrieval constructed on YCbCr color with canny edge histogram and discrete wavelet transform. The combination of edge of histogram and discrete wavelet transform increase the performance of image retrieval framework for content based search. The execution of different wavelets is additionally contrasted with discover the suitability of specific wavelet work for image retrieval. The proposed algorithm is prepared and tried to implement for Wang image database. For Image Retrieval Purpose, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is used and applied on standard dataset in CBIR domain. The execution of the recommended descriptors is assessed by computing both Precision and Recall values and compared with different other proposed methods with demonstrate the predominance of our method. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach outperforms the existing research in term of average precision and recall values.","[Ashraf, Rehan; Ahmed, Mudassar; Jabbar, Sohail] Natl Text Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Khalid, Shehzad] Bahria Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Awais] Yeungnam Univ, Dept Informat & Commun Engn, Gyongsan, South Korea; [Din, Sadia] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Daegu, South Korea; [Jeon, Gwangil] Incheon Natl Univ, Dept Embedded Syst Engn, Incheon, South Korea","Ashraf, R (corresponding author), Natl Text Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",rehan@ntu.edu.pk; mudassar@ntu.edu.pk; sjabbar.research@gmail.com; shehzad_khalid@hotmail.com; aahmad.marwat@gmail.com; research.2486@gmail.com; gjeon@inu.ac.kr,"Ahmad, Awais/AAA-4504-2019; Ashraf, Rehan/AAC-8637-2020","Ashraf, Rehan/0000-0002-6627-9820; Jabbar, Sohail/0000-0002-2127-1235",,,,55,46,46,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In order to perform image-based analysis, a control group consist of 9 healthy males and 2 full-face transplant patients participated in the study. Appearance-based Gabor Wavelet Transform (GWT) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) methods are adopted for recognizing neutral and 6 emotional expressions which consist of angry, scared, happy, hate, confused and sad. Feature extraction was carried out by using both methods and combination of these methods serially. In the performed expressions, the extracted features of the most distinct zones in the facial area where the eye and mouth region, have been used to classify the emotions. Also, the combination of these region features has been used to improve classifier performance. Control subjects and transplant patients' ability to perform emotional expressions have been determined with K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier with region-specific and method-specific decision stages. The results have been compared with healthy group. It has been observed that transplant patients don't reflect some emotional expressions.

A usable application will be easier to use and understand by users, and will improve user's interaction with it. This paper proposes a software requirements catalog for usable mobile health applications, which can be used for the development of new applications, or the evaluation of existing ones. The catalog is based on the main identified sources in literature on usability and mobile health applications. Our catalog was organized according to the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011 standard and follows the SIREN methodology to create reusable catalogs. The applicability of the catalog was verified by the creation of an audit method, which was used to perform the evaluation of a real app, S Health, application created by Samsung Electronics Co. The usability requirements catalog, along with the audit method, identified several usability flaws on the evaluated app, which scored 83%. Some flaws were detected in the app related to the navigation pattern. Some more issues related to the startup experience, empty screens or writing style were also found.

For this reason, the aim of the present study was to investigate the psychophysiological response and quantify the player internal load during, and after playing a chess game. The participant was an elite 33 year-old male chess player ranked among the 300 best chess players in the world. Thus, cortical arousal by critical flicker fusion threshold, electroencephalogram by the theta Fz/alpha Pz ratio and autonomic modulation by heart rate variability were analyzed. Data revealed that cortical arousal by critical flicker fusion threshold and theta Fz/alpha Pz ratio increased and heart rate variability decreased during chess game. All these changes indicated that internal load increased during the chess game. In addition, pre-activation was detected in pre-game measure, suggesting that the prefrontal cortex might be preparatory activated. For these reasons, electroencephalogram, critical flicker fusion threshold and heart rate variability analysis may be highly applicable tools to control and monitor workload in chess player.","[Fuentes, Juan P.; Villafaina, Santos; Collado-Mateo, Daniel; Gusi, Narcis] Univ Extremadura, Fac Sport Sci, Badajoz, Spain; [Collado-Mateo, Daniel] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Educ, Talca, Chile; [de la Vega, Ricardo] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Phys Educ Sport & Human Movement, Madrid, Spain; [Javier Clemente-Suarez, Vicente] European Univ Madrid, Dept Sport Sci, Fac Sport Sci, Appl Psychophysiol Res Grp, Calle Tajo S-N, Madrid 28670, Spain; [Javier Clemente-Suarez, Vicente] Univ Costa, Grp Invest Cultura Educ & Soc, Barranquilla, Colombia","Clemente-Suarez, VJ (corresponding author), European Univ Madrid, Dept Sport Sci, Fac Sport Sci, Appl Psychophysiol Res Grp, Calle Tajo S-N, Madrid 28670, Spain.;Clemente-Suarez, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Costa, Grp Invest Cultura Educ & Soc, Barranquilla, Colombia.",vctxente@yahoo.es,"Collado-Mateo, Daniel/O-6746-2019; de la Vega Marcos, Ricardo/Q-9712-2019; de la Vega, Ricardo/D-8568-2013; García, Juan Pedro Fuentes/L-1540-2018; Gusi, Narcis/C-3870-2010; Villafaina, Santos/R-4566-2019; Clemente-Suarez, Vicente Javier/K-7980-2014","Collado-Mateo, Daniel/0000-0002-5140-465X; de la Vega Marcos, Ricardo/0000-0002-7395-3297; de la Vega, Ricardo/0000-0002-7395-3297; García, Juan Pedro Fuentes/0000-0002-8299-1092; Gusi, Narcis/0000-0002-1001-8883; Villafaina, Santos/0000-0003-0784-1753; Clemente-Suarez, Vicente Javier/0000-0002-2397-2801","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [DEP2015-70356]; Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport [FPU14/01283]; regional department of economy and infrastructure of the Government of Extremadura [PD16008]; European Social Fund [PD16008]","In the framework of Spanish National R + D + i Plan, the current study has been cofunded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness with the reference DEP2015-70356.

However, today Virtual Reality is being integrated into many different areas of our lives, from videogames to different industrial use cases and, of course, it is starting to be used in medicine. There are two great general classifications for Virtual Reality. Firstly, we find a Virtual Reality in which we visualize a world completely created by computer, three-dimensional and where we can appreciate that the world we are visualizing is not real, at least for themoment as rendered images are improving very fast. Secondly, there is a Virtual Reality that basically consists of a reflection of our reality. This type of Virtual Reality is created using spherical or 360 images and videos, so we lose three-dimensional visualization capacity (until the 3D cameras are more developed), but on the other hand we gain in terms of realism in the images. We could also mention a third classification that merges the previous two, where virtual elements created by computer coexist with 360 images and videos. In this articlewe will show two systems that we have developed where each of them can be framed within one of the previous classifications, identifying the technologies used for their implementation as well as the advantages of each one. We will also analize how these systems can improve the current methodologies used for medical training. The implications of these developments as tools for teaching, learning and training are discussed.","[Gonzalez Izard, Santiago] Augmented Real Software SL, ARSOFT, C Duero 12,Parque Cient, Salamanca 37185, Spain; [Gonzalez Izard, Santiago] Univ Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain; [Juanes, Juan A.; Garcia Penalvo, Francisco J.; Goncalvez Estella, Jesus Ma; Sanchez Ledesma, Ma Jose; Ruisoto, Pablo] Univ Salamanca, Visual Med Res Grp, Salamanca, Spain; [Ruisoto, Pablo] European Univ Madrid, Madrid, Spain","Izard, SG (corresponding author), Augmented Real Software SL, ARSOFT, C Duero 12,Parque Cient, Salamanca 37185, Spain.;Izard, SG (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.",santiago.gonzalez.izard@gmail.com,"Juanes Méndez, Juan Antonio/D-8675-2018; Ruisoto, Pablo/J-3170-2019; GARCÍA-PEÑALVO, Francisco José/D-5445-2013","Juanes Méndez, Juan Antonio/0000-0003-2749-3426; Ruisoto, Pablo/0000-0003-1252-0479; GARCÍA-PEÑALVO, Francisco José/0000-0001-9987-5584; Gonzalez Izard, Santiago/0000-0003-2282-1945",,,,15,66,67,10,70,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Demographic (i. e., age, gender), anthropometric (body-mass index), biochemical (i. e., glycated hemoglobin concentration), and hemodynamic (i. e., systolic blood pressure, heart rate) parameters were obtained. Crest time (CT) and crest time ratio (CTR) computed from PPG signals acquired from left index finger were compared with left index finger pulse wave velocity (PWVfinger) obtained from six-channel ECGPWV system to investigate the differences between the two groups and the associations of these indices with the parameters of testing subjects. Significant difference was only noted in CTR between the two groups (P < 0.005). Despite correlation of both CTand CTR with age, only CTR demonstrated significant associations with hemodynamic parameters. CTR could differentiate diabetic patients from healthy individuals despite absence of difference in arterial stiffness assessed by conventional PWV, highlighting its superior sensitivity to subtle changes in diabetes-associated arteriosclerosis.","[Hsu, Po-Chun; Wu, Hsien-Tsai] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Hualien 974, Taiwan; [Sun, Cheuk-Kwan] I Shou Univ, E Da Hosp, Sch Med Int Students, Dept Emergency Med, 1 Yi Da Rd, Kaohsiung 824, Taiwan","Sun, CK (corresponding author), I Shou Univ, E Da Hosp, Sch Med Int Students, Dept Emergency Med, 1 Yi Da Rd, Kaohsiung 824, Taiwan.",lawrence.c.k.sun@gmail.com,"wu, hsientsai/Y-7629-2019; Sun, Cheuk-Kwan/K-5723-2012; Wu, Hsien-Tsai/X-4730-2019","Wu, Hsien-Tsai/0000-0002-2581-9384; Sun, Cheuk-Kwan/0000-0002-2524-9684","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 104-2221-E-259-014 and MOST 105-2221-E259-007] Funding Source: Medline",,,29,16,17,3,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Therefore, this article aims to study and simulate the dynamic behavior of the glenohumeral joint under repetitive conditions that represent the different postures assumed by a violinist during his daily training. For this purpose, the criteria provided by the RULA (rapid upper limb assessment) method have been used. Subsequently, by using as a reference geometry that of the articulation under study generated and modeled in CATIA (R) [VERSION 5R21], a FEM analysis has been proposed with the software ANSYS (R) [VERSION 17.1] simulating the short and cyclic movements of the Humerus of the violinists.

However, it also brings potential privacy threat to the data collection. In healthcare services system, health and medical data that contains privacy information are often transmitted among networks, and such privacy information should be protected. Therefore, there is a need for privacy-preserving data collection (PPDC) scheme to protect clients (patients) data. We adopt (a,k)-anonymity model as privacy pretection scheme for data collection, and propose a novel anonymity-based PPDC method for healthcare services in this paper. The threat model is analyzed in the client-server-to-user (CS2U) model. On client-side, we utilize (a,k)-anonymity notion to generate anonymous tuples which can resist possible attack, and adopt a bottom-up clustering method to create clusters that satisfy a base privacy level of (a(1),k(1))-anonymity. On server-side, we reduce the communication cost through generalization technology, and compress (a(1),k(1))-anonymous data through an UPGMA-based cluster combination method to make the data meet the deeper level of privacy (a(2),k(2))-anonymity (a(1) >= a(2), k(2) >= k(1)).

The simultaneous optimization of the architectures and weights of artificial neural networks (ANNs) through biologically inspired algorithms is an interesting approach for obtaining efficient networks with relatively good generalization capabilities. This methodology constitutes a concordance between a low structural complexity model and low training error rates. Currently, complexity and high error rates are the leading issues faced in the development of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) for pregnancy care. Hence, in this paper the use of a biologically inspired technique, known as particle swarm optimization (PSO), is proposed for reducing the computational cost of the ANN-based method referred to as the multilayer perceptron (MLP), without reducing its precision rate. The results show that the PSO algorithm is able to improve computational model performance, showing lower validation error rates than the conventional approach. This technique can select the best parameters and provide an efficient solution for training the MLP algorithm. The proposed nature-inspired algorithm and its parameter adjustment method improve the performance and precision of CDSSs. This technique can be applied in electronic health (e-health) systems as a useful tool for handling uncertainty in the decision-making process related to high-risk pregnancy. The proposed method outperformed, on average, other approaches by 26.4% in terms of precision and 14.9% in terms of the true positive ratio (TPR), and showed a reduction of 35.4% in the false positive ratio (FPR). Furthermore, this method was superior to the MLP algorithm in terms of precision and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve by 2.3 and 10.2%, respectively, when applied to the delivery outcome for pregnant women.","[Moreira, Mario W.

These software applications are of great interest, both from a teaching and a radiological perspective. In addition, some of these applications are known as Free Open Source Software because they are free and the source code is freely available, and therefore it can be easily obtained even on personal computers. Two examples of free open source software are Osirix Lite (R) and 3D Slicer (R). However, this last group of free applications have limitations in its use. For the radiological field, manipulating and post-processing images is increasingly important. Consequently, sophisticated computing tools that combine software and hardware to process medical images are needed. In radiology, graphic workstations allow their users to process, review, analyse, communicate and exchange multidimensional digital images acquired with different image-capturing radiological devices. These radiological devices are basically CT (Computerised Tomography), MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), PET (Positron Emission Tomography), etc. Nevertheless, the programs included in these workstations have a high cost which always depends on the software provider and is always subject to its norms and requirements. With this study, we aim to present the advantages and disadvantages of these radiological image visualization systems in the advanced management of radiological studies. We will compare the features of the VITREA2 (R) and AW VolumeShare 5 (R) radiology workstation with free open source software applications like OsiriX (R) and 3D Slicer (R), with examples from specific studies.","[Muradas Mujika, Katrin; Framian de Miguel, Andres] Univ Healthcare Complex Salamanca, Paseo San Vicente 58-182, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Antonio Juanes Mendez, Juan] Univ Salamanca, VisualMed Syst Grp, Sch Med, Avda Alfonso X El Sabio S-N, Salamanca 37007, Spain","Mujika, KM (corresponding author), Univ Healthcare Complex Salamanca, Paseo San Vicente 58-182, Salamanca 37007, Spain.",katrin.muradas@gmail.com; jajm@usal.es; frami@usal.es,"Framinan, andres/AAB-8365-2021","Framinan, andres/0000-0002-1522-191X",,,,12,10,10,1,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Therefore, we aimed to assess the frequency and impact of adverse events among inpatients. We analysed an administrative database containing a registration of all hospitalisations occurring in Portuguese public hospitals between 2000 and 2015. We identified all episodes with a registration of adverse events, and classified them into three categories, namely (1) misadventures of surgical and medical care, (2) complications of surgical or medical procedures, and (3) adverse drug events (including adverse drug reactions, poisoning events, and late effects). These episodes were compared over their length of stay, in-hospital mortality, and hospital costs with an equal number of hospitalisations matched for patients' and episodes' characteristics. Between 2000 and 2015, 5.8% (n = 861,372) of all Portuguese hospitalisations had a registration of at least one adverse event. Hospitalisations with registration of adverse events had a median length of stay of 8 days, median hospitalisation costs of 3060.7 Euro, and an in-hospital mortality of 6.7%. Hospitalisations with registration of misadventures of care, complications of procedures and adverse drug reactions had significantly higher lengths of stay and hospitalisation costs than their matched controls. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher for episodes of misadventures of care and complications of procedures, but lower for adverse drug events hospitalisations. Therefore, adverse events are common among inpatients, and have an important clinical and economic impact. Administrative databases may be useful in their epidemiological assessment.","[Sousa-Pinto, Bernardo; Marques, Bernardo; Lopes, Fernando; Freitas, Alberto] Univ Porto, MEDCIDS Dept Community Med Informat & Hlth Decis, Fac Med, Rua Dr Placido Costa, P-4200450 Oporto, Portugal; [Sousa-Pinto, Bernardo; Marques, Bernardo; Lopes, Fernando; Freitas, Alberto] CINTESIS Ctr Hlth Technol & Serv Res, Rua Dr Placida Costa, P-4200450 Oporto, Portugal","Freitas, A (corresponding author), Univ Porto, MEDCIDS Dept Community Med Informat & Hlth Decis, Fac Med, Rua Dr Placido Costa, P-4200450 Oporto, Portugal.;Freitas, A (corresponding author), CINTESIS Ctr Hlth Technol & Serv Res, Rua Dr Placida Costa, P-4200450 Oporto, Portugal.",alberto@med.up.pt,"Freitas, Alberto/C-1972-2012; Sousa-Pinto, Bernardo/O-2846-2014; Freitas, Alberto/AAH-3193-2019","Freitas, Alberto/0000-0003-2113-9653; Sousa-Pinto, Bernardo/0000-0002-1277-3401; Freitas, Alberto/0000-0003-2113-9653; Lopes, Fernando/0000-0002-2278-2264","North Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE), under the PORTUGAL Partnership Agreement [NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000016]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)","The authors wish to thank the project NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000016 (NanoSTIMA), financed by the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, and through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); the project had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

Most medical centers in Taiwan implement the reduction of Door to Balloon (D2B) time, which is defined as the time interval starting when an Acute-Myocardial-Infarction patient arrives at the Emergency Department, and ending when a catheter guide wire crosses the culprit lesion as the acute-myocardial-infarction treatment on the patient in the cardiac catheterization room. Generally, when a patient with acute-chest pain is sent into a hospital (always to Emergency Department), the hospital will collect his/her ECG which needs to be evaluated by a cardiologist to ensure that the patient really has Acute Myocardial Infarction. Then the medical workers deliver the patient to the cardiac catheterization room to operate balloon angioplasty. In previous years, the cardiologist must utilize a PC to connect to the Intranet of the hospital and employ a special PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) image browser before he/she can check the patient's ECG. But this will prolong the D2B time since the doctor may stay outdoors and he/she needs some time to find a PC and network. Of course, if the PC has not installed the PACS image browser, the doctor has to download and install it. Consequently, the D2B time should be worsened, thus possibly impacting the patient's life. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a Cloud-based Electrocardiogram System, with which cardiologists can directly utilize their smart phones to browse the patient's ECG so as to shorten the D2B time. This system has been online in a medical center in middle Taiwan for more than one year. The shortened D2B time is longer than 10 min, i.e., receiving fine results.","[Zhang, Xiu-Shu; Leu, Fang-Yie] Thunghai Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Taichung 40704, Taiwan; [Zhang, Xiu-Shu; Yang, Ching-Wen; Lai, Lai-Shiun] Taichung Vet Gen Hosp, Taichung 40705, Taiwan; [Yang, Ching-Wen] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Informat Engn & Comp Sci, Taichung 40704, Taiwan","Leu, FY (corresponding author), Thunghai Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Taichung 40704, Taiwan.",zxshu@vghtc.gov.tw; leufy@thu.edu.tw; cwyang@vghtc.gov.tw; lslai@vghtc.gov.tw,"Leu, Fang-Yie/AAH-7193-2021",,,,,18,8,8,2,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

However, the ever-increasing volume of images hinder performance of image retrieval systems. Recently, features from deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have yielded state-of-the-art performance in image retrieval. Further, locality sensitive hashing based approaches have become popular for their ability to allow efficient retrieval in large scale datasets. In this paper, we present a highly efficient method to compress selective convolutional features into sequence of bits using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Firstly, highly reactive convolutional feature maps from a pre-trained CNN are identified for medical images based on their neuronal responses using optimal subset selection algorithm. Then, layer-wise global mean activations of the selected feature maps are transformed into compact binary codes using binarization of its Fourier spectrum. The acquired hash codes are highly discriminative and can be obtained efficiently from the original feature vectors without any training. The proposed framework has been evaluated on two large datasets of radiology and endoscopy images. Experimental evaluations reveal that the proposed method significantly outperforms other features extraction and hashing schemes in both effectiveness and efficiency.","[Ahmad, Jamil; Muhammad, Khan; Baik, Sung Wook] Sejong Univ, Digital Contents Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea","Baik, SW (corresponding author), Sejong Univ, Digital Contents Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea.",sbaik@sejong.ac.kr,"Ahmad, Jamil/G-6931-2015; Muhammad, Khan/L-9059-2016; Baik, Sung Wook/AAR-8236-2020","Ahmad, Jamil/0000-0001-8407-5971; Muhammad, Khan/0000-0003-4055-7412; Baik, Sung Wook/0000-0002-6678-7788",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant - Korea Government (MSIP) [2016R1A2B4011712],This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea Government (MSIP) (No.2016R1A2B4011712).,,48,25,25,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The real-time remote monitoring of patients is an important issue in telemedicine. In the provision of healthcare services, patient prioritisation poses a significant challenge because of the complex decision-making process it involves when patients are considered 'big data'. To our knowledge, no study has highlighted the link between 'big data' characteristics and real-time remote healthcare monitoring in the patient prioritisation process, as well as the inherent challenges involved. Thus, we present comprehensive insights into the elements of big data characteristics according to the six 'Vs': volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value and variability. Each of these elements is presented and connected to a related part in the study of the connection between patient prioritisation and realtime remote healthcare monitoring systems. Then, we determine the weak points and recommend solutions as potential future work. This study makes the following contributions. (1) The link between big data characteristics and real-time remote healthcare monitoring in the patient prioritisation process is described. (2) The open issues and challenges for big data used in the patient prioritisation process are emphasised. (3) As a recommended solution, decision making using multiple criteria, such as vital signs and chief complaints, is utilised to prioritise the big data of patients with chronic diseases on the basis of the most urgent cases.","[Kalid, Naser; Zaidan, A.

Presence and distribution of lesional vessels are associated with specific abnormalities. Therefore, detection and localization of cutaneous vessels provide critical information towards diagnosis and stage status of diseases. However, cutaneous vessels are highly variable in shape, size, color and architecture, which complicate the detection task. Considering the large variability of these structures, conventional vessel detection techniques lack the generalizability to detect different vessel types and require separate algorithms to be designed for each type. Furthermore, such techniques are highly dependent on precise hand-crafted features which are time-consuming and computationally inefficient. As a solution, we propose a data-driven feature learning framework based on stacked sparse auto-encoders (SSAE) for comprehensive detection of cutaneous vessels. Each training image is divided into small patches of either containing or non-containing vasculature. A multilayer SSAE is designed to learn hidden features of the data in hierarchical layers in an unsupervised manner. The high-level learned features are subsequently fed into a classifier which categorizes each patch into absence or presence of vasculature and localizes vessels within the lesion. Over a test set of 3095 patches derived from 200 images, the proposed framework demonstrated superior performance of 95.4% detection accuracy over a variety of vessel patterns; outperforming other techniques by achieving the highest positive predictive value of 94.7%. The proposed Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) framework can serve as a decision support system assisting dermatologists for more accurate diagnosis, especially in teledermatology applications in remote areas.","[Kharazmi, Pegah; Lee, Tim K.] Univ British Columbia, Biomed Engn Program, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Zheng, Jiannan; Wang, Z.

As adduced by world health organization, technological proceeds in the field of cardiac function assessment have become the nucleus and heart of all leading research studies in CVDs in which electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is the most functional and convenient tool used to test the range of heart-related irregularities. Most of the approaches present in the literature of ECG signal analysis consider noise removal, rhythm-based analysis, and heartbeat detection to improve the performance of a cardiac pacemaker. Advancements achieved in the field of ECG segments detection and beat classification have a limited evaluation and still require clinical approvals. In this paper, approaches on techniques to implement on-chip ECG detector for a cardiac pacemaker system are discussed. Moreover, different challenges regarding the ECG signal morphology analysis deriving from medical literature is extensively reviewed. It is found that robustness to noise, wavelet parameter choice, numerical efficiency, and detection performance are essential performance indicators required by a state-of-the-art ECG detector. Furthermore, many algorithms described in the existing literature are not verified using ECG data from the standard databases. Some ECG detection algorithms show very high detection performance with the total number of detected QRS complexes. However, the high detection performance of the algorithm is verified using only a few datasets. Finally, gaps in current advancements and testing are identified, and the primary challenge remains to be implementing bullseye test for morphology analysis evaluation.","[Kumar, Ashish; Komaragiri, Rama; Kumar, Manjeet] Bennett Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Gr Noida 201308, UP, India","Kumar, M (corresponding author), Bennett Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Gr Noida 201308, UP, India.",akumar.1june@gmail.com; rama.komaragiri@bennett.edu.in; manjeetchhillar@gmail.com,"Komaragiri, Rama/AAH-8327-2020; Kumar, Ashish/ABI-8377-2020; Kumar, Manjeet/K-1325-2015","Komaragiri, Rama/0000-0002-0468-8506; Kumar, Ashish/0000-0002-8413-1192; Kumar, Manjeet/0000-0001-6578-9741",,,,104,37,37,10,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The specific goal is to retrieve biomedical articles that help answer questions of a specified type about a particular case. Based on the filtered keywords, MeSH(Medical Subject Headings) lexicon and the automatically extracted acronyms, the relationship between keywords and articles was built. The paper gives a detailed description of the process of by which keywords were measured and relevant articles identified based on link analysis in a weighted keywords network. Some important challenges identified in this study include the extraction of diagnosis-related keywords and a collection of valid sentences based on the keyword co-occurrence analysis and existing descriptions of symptoms. All data were taken from medical articles provided in the TREC (Text Retrieval Conference) clinical decision support track 2015. Ten standard topics and one demonstration topic were tested. In each case, a maximum of five articles with the highest relevance were returned. The total user satisfaction of 3.98 was 33% higher than average. The results also suggested that the smaller the number of results, the higher the average satisfaction. However, a few shortcomings were also revealed since medical literature recommendation for clinical diagnostic decision support is so complex a topic that it cannot be fully addressed through the semantic information carried solely by keywords in existing descriptions of symptoms. Nevertheless, the fact that these articles are actually relevant will no doubt inspire future research.","[Li, Shuqing] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Coll Informat Engn, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Sun, Ying; Soergel, Dagobert] SUNY Buffalo, Grad Sch Educ, Dept Lib & Informat Studies, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA","Soergel, D (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo, Grad Sch Educ, Dept Lib & Informat Studies, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",dsoergel@buffalo.edu,,"Li, Shuqing/0000-0001-9814-5766",Chinese National Social Science Foundation [16BTQ030],This work was supported by the Chinese National Social Science Foundation 16BTQ030 (2016).,,36,3,3,5,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The objective was also to recommend steps for defining KPIs in other laboratories. For evaluation of improvement 10 organizational and/or technical KPIs were defined for all phases of laboratory work and measured before (November 2013) and after (from 2015 to 2017) TLA implementation. Out of 10 defined KPIs, 9 were successfully measured and significantly improved. Waiting time for registration of samples in the LIS was significantly reduced from 16 (928) to 9 (6-16) minutes after TLA (P < 0.001). After TLA all tests were performed at core biochemistry analyzers which significantly reduced walking distance for sample management (for more than 800 m per worker) and number of tube touches (for almost 50%). Analyzers downtime and engagement time for analyzers maintenance was reduced for 50 h and 28 h per month, respectively. TLA eliminated manual dilution of samples with extreme results with sigma values increment from 3.4 to > 6 after TLA. Although median turnaround time TAT for potassium and troponin was higher (for approximately 20 min), number of outliers with TAT > 60 min expressed as sigma values were satisfying (> 3). Implementation of the TLA improved the most of the processes in our laboratory with 9 out of 10 properly defined and measured KPIs. With proper planning and defining of KPIs, every laboratory could measure changes in daily workflow.","[Miler, Marijana; Gabaj, Nora Nikolac] Sestre Milosrdnice Univ Hosp Ctr, Dept Clin Chem, Zagreb, Croatia; [Dukic, Lora; Simundic, Ana-Maria] Univ Hosp Sveti Duh, Dept Med Lab Diagnost, Zagreb, Croatia","Miler, M (corresponding author), Sestre Milosrdnice Univ Hosp Ctr, Dept Clin Chem, Zagreb, Croatia.",marijana.miler@gmail.com,,"Nikolac Gabaj, Nora/0000-0001-6831-6309; Miler, Marijana/0000-0002-0569-924X; Dukic, Lora/0000-0001-6690-7551",,,,29,7,7,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Several symptoms of PD include tremor, rigidity, slowness of movements and vocal impairments. In order to develop an effective diagnostic system, a number of algorithms were proposed mainly to distinguish healthy individuals from the ones with PD. However, most of the previous works were conducted based on a binary classification, with the early PD stage and the advanced ones being treated equally. Therefore, in this work, we propose a multiclass classification with three classes of PD severity level (mild, moderate, severe) and healthy control. The focus is to detect and classify PD using signals from wearable motion and audio sensors based on both empirical wavelet transform (EWT) and empirical wavelet packet transform (EWPT) respectively. The EWT/EWPT was applied to decompose both speech and motion data signals up to five levels. Next, several features are extracted after obtaining the instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies from the coefficients of the decomposed signals by applying the Hilbert transform. The performance of the algorithm was analysed using three classifiers -K-nearest neighbour (KNN), probabilistic neural network (PNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM). Experimental results demonstrated that our proposed approach had the ability to differentiate PD from non-PD subjects, including their severity level - with classification accuracies of more than 90% using EWT/EWPT-ELM based on signals from motion and audio sensors respectively. Additionally, classification accuracy of more than 95% was achieved when EWT/EWPT-ELM is applied to signals from integration of both signal's information.","[Oung, Qi Wei; Basah, Shafriza Nisha; Lee, Hoileong; Vijean, Vikneswaran] Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Mechatron Engn, Campus Pauh Putra, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia; [Muthusamy, Hariharan] SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Bioengn, Dept Biomed Engn, Kattankulathur 603203, Tamil Nadu, India","Oung, QW (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Perlis, Sch Mechatron Engn, Campus Pauh Putra, Arau 02600, Perlis, Malaysia.",aliciaoung@gmail.com; hariharan.m@ktr.srmuniv.ac.in; shafriza@unimap.edu.my; hoileong89@gmail.com; vikneswaran@unimap.edu.my,"MUTHUSAMY, HARIHARAN/P-1937-2019; Oung, Qi Wei/J-3470-2015; BASAH, SHAFRIZA NISHA/AAN-8887-2020; Muthusamy, Hariharan/D-2528-2012; Lee, Hoileong/J-3100-2015","Oung, Qi Wei/0000-0001-8486-3513; Muthusamy, Hariharan/0000-0002-8929-3473; Lee, Hoileong/0000-0002-4984-2183; Basah, Shafriza Nisha/0000-0003-0396-4262",,,,86,30,30,4,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

This study had an interrupted time series design. The adherence to the guideline was assessed at fortnightly (two weeks) intervals from January 2016 to January 2017, 6 months before and 6 months after intervention. Newly diagnosed patients with AF were included in the offices of ten cardiologists. Stroke and major bleeding risks were calculated by the CDSS which was implemented via a mobile application. Treatment recommendations based on the guideline were shown to cardiologists. The segmented regression model was used to evaluate the effect of CDSS on level and trend of guideline adherence for the treatment of AF. In our analysis, 373 patients were included. The trend of adherence to the anticoagulation guideline for the treatment of AF was stable in the pre-intervention phase. After the CDSS intervention, mean of the adherence to the guideline significantly increased from 48% to 65.5% (P-value < 0.0001). The trend of adherence to the guideline was stable in the post-intervention phase. Our results showed that the CDSS can improve adherence to the anticoagulation guideline for the treatment of AF.

Over the last ten years however, only a few ex vivo perfusion systems have been developed for this application. While results have been promising, a system capable of facilitating multiple perfusion strategies on the same platform has not yet been realized. In this paper, the design, development and testing of a novel and modular ex vivo perfusion system is described. The system is capable of operating in three unique primary modes: the traditional Langendorff Mode, Pump-Supported Working-Mode, and Passive Afterload Working-Mode. In each mode, physiological hemodynamic parameters can be produced by managing perfusion settings. To evaluate heart viability, six experiments were conducted using porcine hearts and measuring several parameters including: pH, aortic pressure, lactate metabolism, coronary vascular resistance (CVR), and myocardial oxygen consumption. Pressure-volume relationship measurements were used to assess left ventricular contractility in each Working Mode. Hemodynamic and metabolic conditions remained stable and consistent across 4 h of ex vivo heart perfusion on the ex vivo perfusion system, validating the system as a viable platform for future development of novel preservation and assessment strategies.","[Xin, Liming; Gellner, Bryan; Zu, Jean] Univ Toronto, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Xin, Liming; Ribeiro, Roberto Vanin Pinto; Banner, David; Rao, Vivek; Badiwala, Mitesh V.] Toronto Gen Hosp, Dept Cardiovasc Surg, Univ Hlth Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ribeiro, Roberto Vanin Pinto; Rao, Vivek] Univ Toronto, Inst Med Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ruggeri, Giulia Maria; Meineri, Massimiliano] Toronto Gen Hosp, Univ Hlth Network, Dept Anesthesia & Pain Management, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Meineri, Massimiliano; Rao, Vivek; Badiwala, Mitesh V.] Univ Toronto, Fac Med, Toronto, ON, Canada","Xin, LM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Xin, LM (corresponding author), Toronto Gen Hosp, Dept Cardiovasc Surg, Univ Hlth Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.",xin_liming@hotmail.com,,"Badiwala, Mitesh/0000-0003-4377-4164",,,,19,16,16,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Correlation filters have been widely used in object detection and tracking applications but their strength has not been explored in the medical imaging domain up till now. Our experimental results show that the proposed scheme gives state of the art accuracy and can learn complex nuclear morphologies. Like deep learning approaches, the proposed filters do not require engineering of image features as they can operate directly on histopathology images without significant preprocessing. However, unlike deep learning methods, the large-margin correlation filters developed in this work are interpretable, computationally efficient and do not require specialized or expensive computing hardware.

However, over the years, researchers and health practitioners presented the theoretical and methodological limitations of DEA that limits the full view of healthcare efficiency. To address these limitations, a commonly used strategy is to integrate other statistical methods and techniques with DEA to provide better efficiency evaluation. This paper reviews 57 studies with DEA applications in the healthcare industry to illustrate the integrated analysis of healthcare efficiency. With DEA as the central method, regression models in conjunction with statistical tests are commonly used. Input-oriented radial DEA models using predominantly capacity-related inputs and activity-related outputs and following either constant return to scale or variable return to scale assumptions are mostly applied to measure healthcare efficiency.","[Cantor, Victor John M.; Poh, Kim Leng] Natl Univ Singapore, Ind Syst Engn & Management, Singapore, Singapore","Cantor, VJM (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Ind Syst Engn & Management, Singapore, Singapore.",victorjohn.cantor@u.nus.edu; pohkimleng@nus.edu.sg,,,,,,125,36,36,29,101,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The tunable filter bank, based on a half-band polynomial of 14th order, extracts distinct features from ear images maintaining its frequency selectivity property. To advocate the applicability of tunable filter bank on ear biometrics, recognition test has been performed on available constrained databases like AMI, WPUT, IITD and unconstrained database like UERC. Experiments have been conducted applying tunable filter based feature extractor on subparts of the ear. Empirical experiments have been conducted with four and six subdivisions of the ear image. Analyzing the experimental results, it has been found that tunable filter moderately succeeds to distinguish ear features at par with the state-of-the-art features used for ear recognition. Accuracies of 70.58%, 67.01%, 81.98%, and 57.75% have been achieved on AMI, WPUT, IITD, and UERC databases through considering Canberra Distance as underlying measure of separation.

Hands free communication devices (HFCD) allow instantaneous, closed-loop communication between physicians and other members of a multidisciplinary team, providing a communication advantage over traditional pager systems. HFCD have been shown to decrease emergency room interruptions, improve nursing communication, improve speed of information flow, and eliminate health care waste. We evaluated the integration of an HFCD with an existing alphanumeric paging system on an acute inpatient medicine service. We conducted a prospective, observational, survey-based study over twenty-four weeks in an academic tertiary care center with attending physicians and residents. Our intervention involved the implementation of an HFCD alongside the existing paging system. Fifty-six pre and post surveys evaluated the perception of improvement in communication and the integration of the HFCD into existing workflow. We saw significant improvements in the ability of an HFCD to help physicians communicate thoughts clearly, communicate thoughts effectively, reach team members, reach ancillary staff, and stay informed about patients. Physicians also reported better workflow integration during admissions, rounds, discharge, and teaching sessions. Qualitative data from post surveys demonstrated that the greatest strengths of the HFCD included the ability to reach colleagues and staff quickly, provide instant access to individuals of the care team, and improve overall communication. Integration of an instantaneous, hands free, closed loop communication system alongside the existing pager system can provide improvements in the perceptions of communication and workflow integration in an academic medicine service. Future studies are needed to correlate these subjective findings with objective measures of quality and safety.","[Fang, Daniel Z.; Patil, Teja; Yeung, Marianne; Posley, Keith; Allaudeen, Nazima] VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Fang, Daniel Z.; Patil, Teja; Yeung, Marianne; Posley, Keith; Allaudeen, Nazima] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Belitskaya-Levy, Ilana] VA Palo Alto Cooperat Studies Program Coordinatin, Mountain View, CA USA","Fang, DZ (corresponding author), VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.;Fang, DZ (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",Daniel.Fang@va.gov,,,,,,10,5,5,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

We evaluated the impact of an electronic medical record (EMR)-based alerting dashboard on outcomes associated with RRS activation. We used a repeated treatment study in which the dashboard display was successively turned on and off each week for ten 2-week cycles over a 20-week period on the inpatient acute care wards of an academic medical center. The Rapid Response Team (RRT) dashboard displayed all hospital patients in a single view ranked by severity score, updated in real time. The dashboard could be seen within the EMR by any provider, including RRT members. The primary outcomes were the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of all RRT activations, unexpected ICU transfers, cardiopulmonary arrests and deaths on general medicalsurgical wards (wards). We conducted an exploratory analysis of first RRT activations. There were 6736 eligible admissions during the 20-week study period. There was no change in overall RRT activations (IRR = 1.14, p = 0.07), but a significant increase in first RRT activations (IRR = 1.20, p = 0.04). There were no significant differences in unexpected ICU transfers (IRR = 1.15, p = 0.25), cardiopulmonary arrests on general wards (IRR = 1.46, p = 0.43), or deaths on general wards (IRR = 0.96, p = 0.89). The introduction of the RRT dashboard was associated with increased initial RRT activations but not overall activations, unexpected ICU transfers, cardiopulmonary arrests, or death. The RRT dashboard is a novel tool to help providers recognize patient decompensation and may improve initial RRT notification.","[Fletcher, Grant S.] Univ Washington, Dept Med, Hosp Med Program, Harborview Med Ctr, 325 Ninth Ave,Box 359780, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Aaronson, Barry A.] Virginia Mason Med Ctr, Dept Hosp Med, 925 Seneca St, Seattle, WA 98101 USA; [White, Andrew A.] Univ Washington, Dept Med, 1959 NE Pacific,Box 356429, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [White, Andrew A.] Univ Washington, Ctr Scholarship Patient Care Qual & Safety, 1959 NE Pacific,Box 356429, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Julka, Reena] Dupage Med Grp, 25 N Winfield St, Winfield, IL 60190 USA","White, AA (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Med, 1959 NE Pacific,Box 356429, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;White, AA (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Ctr Scholarship Patient Care Qual & Safety, 1959 NE Pacific,Box 356429, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",grantf@u.washington.edu; Barry.Aaronson@virginiamason.org; andwhite@uw.edu; reena610@gmail.com,"White, Andrew A/AAW-2681-2021; Smith, Gary B/A-8235-2013","White, Andrew A/0000-0002-9859-0947; ",National Library of Medicine [LM007442-07],The investigation was supported by National Library of Medicine Sponsored Medical Informatics Fellowship LM007442-07.,,42,12,12,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The novelty of our approach consists of two aspects: 1) automatic detection of initial optimum object boundary based on a Region Classification Model (RCM) in a pixel-level multidimensional feature space; 2) an Adaptive Edge Smoothing Update model (AESU) of contour points (e.g. misclassified or irregular points) based on iterative force field calculations with contours obtained from the RCM by minimising energy function (an approach that does not require predefined geometric templates to guide auto-segmentation). Such an approach provides robustness in capturing a range of variations and shapes. We have conducted a comprehensive comparison between our approach and the state-of-the-art existing deformable models and validated it with publicly available datasets. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods. The generality of the proposed approach will enable segmentation and detection of other object boundaries and provide added value in the field of medical image processing and analysis.,"[Haleem, Muhammad Salman; Han, Liangxiu] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Comp Math & Digital Technol, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England; [van Hemert, Jano; Fleming, Alan] Optos Plc, Queensferry House,Carnegie Business Campus, Dunfermline KY11 8GR, Fife, Scotland; [Li, Baihua] Loughborough Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Pasquale, Louis R.; Song, Brian J.] Harvard Med Sch, Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirm, Dept Ophthalmol, Boston, MA USA","Haleem, MS (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Comp Math & Digital Technol, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England.",m.haleem@mmu.ac.uk; l.han@mmu.ac.uk; jvanhemert@OPTOS.COM; B.Li@lboro.ac.uk; afleming@OPTOS.COM; Louis_Pasquale@meei.harvard.edu; Brian_Song@meei.harvard.edu,"Haleem, Salman/AAM-7146-2020; van Hemert, Jano I/C-3094-2009","Haleem, Salman/0000-0001-5946-6567; van Hemert, Jano I/0000-0003-0834-7079; Fleming, Alan/0000-0003-0642-7331",EPSRC-DHPA; Optos plc.

Time-frequency analysis provides simultaneous interpretations in both time and frequency domain enabling comprehensive explanation, presentation and interpretation of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The diversity of TFDs and specific properties for each type show the need to determine the best TFD for ECG analysis. In this study, a performance evaluation of five TFDs in term of ECG abnormality detection is presented. The detection criteria based on extracted features from most important ECG signal components (QRS) to detect normal and abnormal cases. This is achieved by estimating its energy concentration magnitude using the TFDs. The TFDs analyse ECG signals in one-minute interval instead of conventional time domain approach that analyses based on beat or frame containing several beats. The MIT-BIH normal sinus rhythm ECG database total records of 18 long-term ECG sampled at 128 Hz have been analysed. The tested TFDs include Dual-Tree Wavelet Transform, Spectrogram, Pseudo Wigner-Ville, Choi-Williams, and Born-Jordan. Each record is divided into one-minute slots, which is not considered previously, and analysed. The sample periods (slots) are randomly selected ten minutes interval for each record. This result with 99.44% detection accuracy for 15,735 ECG beats shows that Choi-Williams distribution is most reliable to be used for heart problem detection especially in automated systems that provide continuous monitoring for long time duration.","[Hussein, Ahmed Faeq; Hashim, Shaiful Jahari; Rokhani, Fakhrul Zaman; Adnan, Wan Azizun Wan] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Engn, Dept Comp & Commun Syst Engn, Serdang 43400, Malaysia; [Hussein, Ahmed Faeq] AL Nahrain Univ, Fac Engn, Biomed Engn Dept, Baghdad, Iraq; [Aziz, Ahmad Fazli Abdul] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Med, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Serdang 43400, Malaysia","Hashim, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Engn, Dept Comp & Commun Syst Engn, Serdang 43400, Malaysia.",sjh@upm.edu.my,"Hussein, Ahmed Faeq/P-3662-2019; Rokhani, Fakhrul Zaman/L-2896-2016","Hussein, Ahmed Faeq/0000-0003-2483-0028; Rokhani, Fakhrul Zaman/0000-0001-6449-8184; Hashim, Shaiful/0000-0002-4436-897X","Universiti Putra Malaysia, Post Graduate Student Grant (IPS)","This study was supported by Universiti Putra Malaysia, Post Graduate Student Grant (IPS).",,74,14,14,4,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

Identifying the steps with the greatest delays enables a focused effort to improve the timeliness of care-delivery, without sacrificing quality. We retrospectively reviewed clinical events from initial detection, through histologic diagnosis, radiologic and invasive staging, and medical clearance, to surgery for all patients who had an attempted resection of a suspected lung cancer in a community healthcare system. We used a computer process modeling approach to evaluate delays in care delivery, in order to identify potential 'bottlenecks' in waiting time, the reduction of which could produce greater care efficiency. We also conducted 'what-if' analyses to predict the relative impact of simulated changes in the care delivery process to determine the most efficient pathways to surgery. The waiting time between radiologic lesion detection and diagnostic biopsy, and the waiting time from radiologic staging to surgery were the two most critical bottlenecks impeding efficient care delivery (more than 3 times larger compared to reducing other waiting times). Additionally, instituting surgical consultation prior to cardiac consultation for medical clearance and decreasing the waiting time between CT scans and diagnostic biopsies, were potentially the most impactful measures to reduce care delays before surgery. Rigorous computer simulation modeling, using clinical data, can provide useful information to identify areas for improving the efficiency of care delivery by process engineering, for patients who receive surgery for lung cancer.","[Ju, Feng] Arizona State Univ, Sch Comp Informat & Decis Syst Engn, Tempe, AZ USA; [Lee, Hyo Kyung; Li, Jingshan] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 1513 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Yu, Xinhua] Univ Memphis, Sch Publ Hlth, 205 Robison Hall, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; [Faris, Nicholas R.; Rugless, Fedoria; Osarogiagbon, Raymond U.] Baptist Mem Hlth Care Corp, Baptist Canc Ctr, Thorac Oncol Res Grp, 80 Humphreys Ctr Dr,Suite 340, Memphis, TN 38120 USA; [Jiang, Shan] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, 96 Frelinghuysen Rd,CoRE Bldg,Room 201, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Osarogiagbon, Raymond U.] Baptist Canc Ctr, Thorac Oncol Res Grp, 80 Humphreys Ctr Dr,Suite 220, Memphis, TN 38120 USA","Osarogiagbon, RU (corresponding author), Baptist Mem Hlth Care Corp, Baptist Canc Ctr, Thorac Oncol Res Grp, 80 Humphreys Ctr Dr,Suite 340, Memphis, TN 38120 USA.;Osarogiagbon, RU (corresponding author), Baptist Canc Ctr, Thorac Oncol Res Grp, 80 Humphreys Ctr Dr,Suite 220, Memphis, TN 38120 USA.",feng.ju@asu.edu; hlee555@wisc.edu; xyu2@memphis.edu; nick.faris@bmhcc.org; fedoria.rugless@bmhcc.org; sj576@rutgers.edu; Jingshan.li@wisc.edu; rosarogi@bmhcc.org,"Li, Jingshan/L-4667-2019","Li, Jingshan/0000-0003-0148-1232; Lee, Hyo Kyung/0000-0002-0735-662X",PCORI Grant [IH-1304-6147],PCORI Grant IH-1304-6147.,,22,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

The purpose of cryptography is to transmit a message between a sender and receiver such that an eavesdropper is unable to comprehend it. To accomplish this, not only we need a strong algorithm, but a strong key and a strong concept for encryption and decryption process. We have introduced a concept of DNA Deep Learning Cryptography which is defined as a technique of concealing data in terms of DNA sequence and deep learning. In the cryptographic technique, each alphabet of a letter is converted into a different combination of the four bases, namely; Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G) and Thymine (T), which make up the human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Actual implementations with the DNA don't exceed laboratory level and are expensive. To bring DNA computing on a digital level, easy and effective algorithms are proposed in this paper. In proposed work we have introduced firstly, a method and its implementation for key generation based on the theory of natural selection using Genetic Algorithm with Needleman-Wunsch (NW) algorithm and Secondly, a method for implementation of encryption and decryption based on DNA computing using biological operations Transcription, Translation, DNA Sequencing and Deep Learning.","[Kalsi, Shruti; Kaur, Harleen] Jamia Hamdard, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Sch Engn Sci & Technol, New Delhi, India; [Kalsi, Shruti] Xerox Technol Ltd, 5th 6th Floor,Vatika Business Pk, Gurugram, Haryana, India; [Chang, Victor] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Int Business Sch Suzhou, Suzhou, Peoples R China","Kaur, H (corresponding author), Jamia Hamdard, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Sch Engn Sci & Technol, New Delhi, India.",shruti.kalsi88@gmail.com; harleen.unu@gmail.com; Victor.Chang@xjtlu.edu.cn,"Chang, Victor/AAC-7582-2019; K, Harleen/T-2613-2019","Chang, Victor/0000-0002-8012-5852; Kaur, Dr. Harleen/0000-0001-9780-2138","National Council for Science and Technology Communications (NCSTC), Department of Science and Technology (DST), Ministry of Science and Technology (Govt. of India); Ministry of Science and Technology (Govt. of India), India","This research work is catalyzed and supported by National Council for Science and Technology Communications (NCSTC), Department of Science and Technology (DST), Ministry of Science and Technology (Govt. of India) for support and motivation [grant recipient: Dr. Harleen Kaur].

But, the accuracy of these systems still needs significant improvement in order to meet the necessity of real world diagnostic situations. In this paper, an efficient PBDS based on MR images is proposed that markedly improves the recent results. The proposed system makes use of contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) to enhance the quality of the input MR images. Thereafter, two-dimensional PCA (2DPCA) strategy is employed to extract the features and subsequently, a PCA+LDA approach is used to generate a compact and discriminative feature set. Finally, a new learning algorithm called MDE-ELM is suggested that combines modified differential evolution (MDE) and extreme learning machine (ELM) for segregation of MR images as pathological or healthy. The MDE is utilized to optimize the input weights and hidden biases of single-hidden-layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFN), whereas an analytical method is used for determining the output weights. The proposed algorithm performs optimization based on both the root mean squared error (RMSE) and norm of the output weights of SLFNs. The suggested scheme is benchmarked on three standard datasets and the results are compared against other competent schemes. The experimental outcomes show that the proposed scheme offers superior results compared to its counterparts. Further, it has been noticed that the proposed MDE-ELM classifier obtains better accuracy with compact network architecture than conventional algorithms.","[Nayak, Deepak Ranjan; Dash, Ratnakar; Majhi, Banshidhar] Natl Inst Technol, Pattern Recognit Lab, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Rourkela 769008, India","Nayak, DR (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol, Pattern Recognit Lab, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Rourkela 769008, India.",depakranjannayak@gmail.com,"Dash, Ratnakar/F-1498-2018","Dash, Ratnakar/0000-0001-9886-2546",,,,46,11,12,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

In these areas, common ailments that are easy to manage with medicines, often lead to medical escalations and even fatalities due to lack of awareness and delayed diagnosis. The introduction of wearable health devices has made it easier to monitor health conditions and to connect doctors and patients in urban areas. However, existing initiatives have not succeeded in providing adequate health monitoring to rural and low-literate patients, as current methods are expensive, require consistent connectivity and expect literate users. Our design considerations address these concerns by providing low-cost medical devices connected to a low-cost health platform, along with personalized guidance based on patient physiological parameters in local languages, and alerts to medical practitioners in case of emergencies. This patient-centric integrated healthcare system is designed to manage the overall health of villagers with real-time health monitoring of patients, to offer guidance on preventive care, and to increase health awareness and self-monitoring at an affordable price. This personalized health monitoring system addresses the health-related needs in remote and rural areas by (1) empowering health workers in monitoring of basic health conditions for rural patients in order to prevent escalations, (2) personalized feedback regarding nutrition, exercise, diet, preventive Ayurveda care and yoga postures based on vital parameters and (3) reporting of patient data to the patient's health center with emergency alerts to doctor and patient.

However they pose new ethics and regulatory challenges since they cross the gap between patients and medical practitioners. One of the critical issues for CSP is to enforce a strict control on access privileges whilst allowing the users to take advantage of the breadth of the available data. We propose Cerberus, a new access control scheme spanning the whole life-cycle of access right management: design, implementation, deployment and maintenance, operations. Cerberus enables switching from a dual world, where CSP data can be accessed either from the users who entered it or fully de-identified, to an access-when-required world, where patients, practitioners and researchers can access focused medical data through explicit authorisation by the data owner. Efficient access control requires application-specific access rights, as well as the ability to restrict these rights when they are not used. Cerberus is implemented and evaluated in the context of the GENIDA project, an international CSP for Genetically determined Intellectual Disabilities and Autism Spectrum Disorders.

Thus in current IT era, our healthcare industry needs to focus on adapting information technology in healthcare services. Barring few preliminary attempts to digitalize basic hospital administrative and clinical functions, even today in India, child health and vaccination records are still maintained as paper-based records. Also, error in manually plotting the parameters in growth charts results in missed opportunities for early detection of growth disorders in children. To address these concerns, we present India's first hospital linked, affordable automated vaccination and real-time child's growth monitoring cloud based application-Integrated Child Health Record cloud (iCHRcloud). This application is based on HL7 protocol enabling integration with hospital's HIS/EMR system. It provides Java (Enterprise Service Bus and Hibernate) based web portal for doctors and mobile application for parents, enhancing doctor-parent engagement. It leverages highchart to automate chart preparation and provides access of data via Push Notification (GCM and APNS) to parents on iOS and Android mobile platforms. iCHRcloud has also been recognized as one of the best innovative solution in three nationwide challenges, 2016 in India. iCHRcloud offers a seamless, secure (256 bit HTTPS) and sustainable solution to reduce child mortality. Detail analysis on preliminary data of 16,490 child health records highlight the diversified need of various demographic regions. Thus, primary lesson would be to implement better validation strategies to fulfill the customize requisites of entire population. This paper presents first glimpse of data and power of the analytics in policy framework.","[Singh, Harpreet; Brahmachari, Samir K.] Acad Sci & Innovat Res, New Delhi, India; [Singh, Harpreet] iNICU Med Private Ltd, New Delhi, India; [Mallaiah, Raghuram] Fortis Le Femme, Greater Kailash 2, New Delhi, India; [Yadav, Gautam] Kalawati Hosp, Rewari, Haryana, India; [Verma, Nitin] Nitin Verma Clin, Delhi, India; [Sawhney, Ashu] Jaypee Hosp, Noida, UP, India; [Brahmachari, Samir K.] CSIR, Inst Genom & Integrated Biol, Mathura Rd, New Delhi 110020, India","Singh, H; Brahmachari, SK (corresponding author), Acad Sci & Innovat Res, New Delhi, India.;Singh, H (corresponding author), iNICU Med Private Ltd, New Delhi, India.;Brahmachari, SK (corresponding author), CSIR, Inst Genom & Integrated Biol, Mathura Rd, New Delhi 110020, India.",harpreet_singh@oxyent.com; skb@igib.in,,,"Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India [GAP0093]","We would like to thank DST, IBM, T-Hub and IIMA for recognizing the iCHRcloud as an innovative sustainable solution in child healthcare.

In the earlier stage of pregnancy, fetus problem can be identified by finding information about the fetus to avoid stillbirths. The gold standard used to monitor the health status of the fetus is by Cardiotachography(CTG), cannot be used for long durations and continuous monitoring. There is a need for continuous and long duration monitoring of fetal ECG signals to study the progressive health status of the fetus using portable devices. The non-invasive method of electrocardiogram recording is one of the best method used to diagnose fetal cardiac problem rather than the invasive methods. The monitoring of the fECG requires development of a miniaturized hardware and a efficient signal processing algorithms to extract the fECG embedded in the mother ECG. The paper discusses a prototype hardware developed to monitor and record the raw mother ECG signal containing the fECG and a signal processing algorithm to extract the fetal Electro Cardiogram signal. We have proposed two methods of signal processing, first is based on the Least Mean Square (LMS) Adaptive Noise Cancellation technique and the other method is based on the Wavelet Transformation technique. A prototype hardware was designed and developed to acquire the raw ECG signal containing the mother and fetal ECG and the signal processing techniques were used to eliminate the noises and extract the fetal ECG and the fetal Heart Rate Variability was studied. Both the methods were evaluated with the signal acquired from a fetal ECG simulator, from the Physionet database and that acquired from the subject. Both the methods are evaluated by finding heart rate and its variability, amplitude spectrum and mean value of extracted fetal ECG. Also the accuracy, sensitivity and positive predictive value are also determined for fetal QRS detection technique. In this paper adaptive filtering technique uses Sign-sign LMS algorithm and wavelet techniques with Daubechies wavelet, employed along with de noising techniques for the extraction of fetal Electrocardiogram. Both the methods are having good sensitivity and accuracy. In adaptive method the sensitivity is 96.83, accuracy 89.87, wavelet sensitivity is 95.97 and accuracy is 88.5. Additionally, time domain parameters from the plot of heart rate variability of mother and fetus are analyzed.","[Sutha, P.] PSNA Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Dindigul, Tamil Nadu, India; [Jayanthi, V.

It alters the brain structure. Recently, scholars tend to use computer vision based techniques to detect AUD. We collected 235 subjects, 114 alcoholic and 121 non-alcoholic. Among the 235 image, 100 images were used as training set, and data augmentation method was used. The rest 135 images were used as test set. Further, we chose the latest powerful technique-convolutional neural network (CNN) based on convolutional layer, rectified linear unit layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and softmax layer. We also compared three different pooling techniques: max pooling, average pooling, and stochastic pooling. The results showed that our method achieved a sensitivity of 96.88%, a specificity of 97.18%, and an accuracy of 97.04%. Our method was better than three state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, stochastic pooling performed better than other max pooling and average pooling. We validated CNN with five convolution layers and two fully connected layers performed the best. The GPU yielded a 149x acceleration in training and a 166x acceleration in test, compared to CPU.","[Wang, Shui-Hua; Zhang, Yu-Dong] Univ Leicester, Dept Informat, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Wang, Shui-Hua] Nanjing Univ, Sch Elect Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lv, Yi-Ding; Sui, Yuxiu] Nanjing Med Univ, Nanjing Brain Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shuai] Inner Mongolia Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Hohhot 010012, Peoples R China; [Wang, Su-Jing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, Key Lab Behav Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Zhang, YD (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Dept Informat, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.;Liu, S (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Hohhot 010012, Peoples R China.;Wang, SJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, Key Lab Behav Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",cs_liushuai@imu.edu.cn; wangsujing@psych.ac.cn; yudongzhang@ieee.org,"Liu, Shuai/AAX-1239-2021; Liu, Shuai/P-3939-2017; Wang, Shuihua/G-7326-2016; Zhang, Yudong/I-7633-2013; Liu, Shuai/AAB-1960-2019","Liu, Shuai/0000-0001-9909-0664; Liu, Shuai/0000-0001-9909-0664; Wang, Shuihua/0000-0003-4713-2791; Zhang, Yudong/0000-0002-4870-1493; ",Natural Science Foundation of China [61602250]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20150983],This paper is financially supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (61602250) and Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20150983).,,32,117,120,3,45,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0148-5598,1573-689X,,J MED SYST,J.

This paper proposes a new two-step CBIR scheme (TSCBIR) for computer-aided diagnosis of lung nodules. Two similarity metrics, semantic relevance and visual similarity, are introduced to measure the similarity of different nodules. The first step is to search for K most similar reference ROIs for each queried ROI with the semantic relevance metric. The second step is to weight each retrieved ROI based on its visual similarity to the queried ROI. The probability is computed to predict the likelihood of the queried ROI depicting a malignant lesion. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed algorithm, a lung nodule dataset including 366 nodule regions of interest (ROIs) is assembled from LIDC-IDRI lung images on CT scans. Three groups of texture features are implemented to represent a nodule ROI. Our experimental results on the assembled lung nodule dataset show good performance improvement over existing popular classifiers.","[Wei, Guohui; Cao, Hui; Ma, Zhiqing] Shandong Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Sch Sci & Engn, Jinan 250355, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Ma, He; Qi, Shouliang; Qian, Wei] Northeast Univ, Sinodutch Biomed & Informat Engn Sch, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Qian, Wei] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, El Paso, TX 79968 USA","Wei, GH (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Sch Sci & Engn, Jinan 250355, Shandong, Peoples R China.",bmie530@163.com,"Qian, Wei/B-8231-2013",,"Recruitment Program of Global Experts [01270021814101/022]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61702087, 81671773, 61672146, 81473708]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [N150408001]","The research is supported by the Recruitment Program of Global Experts (Grant no. 01270021814101/022), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61702087; No. 81671773; No. 61672146; No. 81473708), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant no.
